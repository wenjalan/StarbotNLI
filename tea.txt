HELL YEAH
Am I actually feather weight or is it placebo
We should run an experiment on my tolerance
i have yet to determine whether my own tolerance is good or bad
indeed
just like most things in life
only partly
tolerance to an extent is determined by genetics
depending on how much and often you drink
yeah but tolerance is variable
if you have higher tolerance you don't feel the bad effects of alcohol as soon as low tolerance people so you'd be more likely to drink
people who enjoy alcohol and have an addiction have a higher tolerance?
definitely not
figure it'd be the other way around
not
are you sure it goes that way?
or idk maybe you already knew that
fun fact: people who have high alcohol tolerance are much more likely to enjoy drinking lots and get addicted to alcohol
i think it was from costco so y'all could also try it if you wanted lol
i've only had soju once; we got this weird version that was opaque white and you could feel the texture of suspended solids
facts ;~;
at least I can black out for cheaper
fucking lightweight
hahahahahaha
🙂
i wouldnt be surprised either way
he waters his soju down so much
i mean
^
oh LOL
that he put water in
it was the soju bottle
it wasnt a tea bottle
i think he means
think that was water
how did you
I thought it smelled a little fruity
share
lmfao
are you serious
l o l
IT'S SOJU
THIS ISN'T TEA
WAIT SHIT
It tastes like tea
I put water in my tea thermoflask and took a sip
should have shaved my head at the beginning of quarantine; it would grow out by the end anyway 😂

*dj khaled voice* anotha one

I wish it was more common but lgbt was already the standard so we just added alphabet soup ig
than listing out every letter
it's just easier
gsm = gender & sexual minorities
I think I'm gonna start using gsm as an acronym instead of lgbtq
vaguely related side note
idk if I ever will be
plus I'm not out to my parents
I'm better at giving specific arguments than general advice lmao
idk tbh
dont tell ur jehovah withness grandmother
I'm all ears
<@!503787499605458954> any advice when it comes to defending lgbtq+ people from my standpoint?
hell yea
let's go boys
I'm gonna meet my future gf inside Paper Mario
oH SHIT
they met inside a video game 😉
and there is hope for us alan
need a date to the wedding?
HEY
but my cousin got married
YOU
FUCK
not to take aways alans spotlight
lots of passive aggressivism, boasting, bragging, and talks of "respect"
let's just say the uncles and aunties are an echo chamber of narrow minded thought and leave it at that
oh?
I'm expecting a huge firestorm
he'll drop it to the uncles and aunties later
ah
just us for now, the cousins
(he's one year older than me)
how'd the family react
I will also defend him at all costs
I'm like "Is it weird if I say I'm proud of you?"
it's chill no one ever reads when I link stuff anyways l o l
the rest of us are like congrats
the bi cousin (who's extremely *supportive* of LGBTQA+ stuff) is vowing to defend him at all costs
oh shit!
(that's totally stealing your spotlight but hey)
not to steal your spotlight but one of my cousins came out as gay
This genuinely upsets me sm ugh

night!
Night lol
I'll sleep on the idea
but cool
idk who that is
That's all
I would murder to protect her
I've embraced my simp status
LMAO
I wanna say I'd have a pretty low score but tbh hololive has me by the neck
hmmm
maybe not tier 3
literally begging for a crumb
but somehow still expect to get pussy
that's the bottom
they're openly misogynistic
bc I feel like
I don't know where incels would fall on a simp scale tbh
Where on the spectrum would you fall, incel or tier 3 pokemane sub
I'd get top marks for the first time in my life
I wonder if someone has made a simp test scoring system yet
avocadoes
red wine
I think a cat fits in the picture as well
has a live laugh love sign somewhere
probably in her 30s
I'm picturing a white millennial
exactly
but I also feel like it stems from a misunderstanding of the term and the pop culture around it lol
I can see why someone might think that
idk like
It's like an onion of victimization that goes dozens of layers deep
Yup
what, that calling people simps is misogyny? lol
I find it incredibly ironic that it was the @feminist account on Insta that even brought up this argument
I gotta up my game
that's some next level ego there
w o w
I'd simp for myself
I'd simp for you b
also 90% of the time it's kind of a joke
^
not bc he sees her as an actual human
bc he's only being respectful or whatever bc he's into her
what I mean is I don't think it's misogynistic at all to call a guy a simp
oh
i could be wrong
i just feel like contextualizing the word that way is misleading and kinda ill-fitting?
yes but i wouldn't say that's just "treating women with respect"
^
Simp is supposed to be used in reference to guys who perform acts of kindness, subservience, or defense of a girl in aims of getting in her pants
shit dude I call myself a simp all the time
it's not strict and id argue that it's not just that
and `treat women with respect` goes very fast and loose
i mean i think you can argue it both ways
By "discouraging men who treat women with respect"
do you mean misandry?
Can I get confirmation from someone that calling someone a simp isn't misogyny
nah it isn't sarcastic enough
<@!478706068223164416> is this you?

Ended up sleeping like
I'm not driving for once so I don't really have to care 😄
so we will see
I kinda dont wanna sleep
but
I also have to be up at 5 tomorrow lol
Night folks
Ok well that’s my cue to go to sleep
Everyone is crazy
Woooo
the beauty community is batshit insane
> Is this how the beauty community looks to outsiders lol
yes
^ that
like just respect people?? if someone says it's offensive just move on
Is this how the beauty community looks to outsiders lol
Honestly I kind of agree
it is complicated and I don't wanna try to oversimplify it, but also like I just don't get why literally anyone would care enough to have a flame war over this
Hollow eve talked about it pretty indignantly on Dragula and while I don’t agree with everything she says, it comes down to whether it’s being understood for its implications or co-opted by people who don’t know the history or context
It’s often used as a compliment now but its origin refers to the female anatomy
It’s like using the word fish in the drag community
Ok my opinion is honestly that it’s complicated
Or "retard" for that matter
It makes me wonder if a similar situation would develop if the term "autist" was banned in r/WallStreetBets
But when the mods suddenly introduced the new rule with no discussion and no community input, the flame war began and the two communities began to clash
But it's old definition and meaning still exist outside the community, and before the rule change very few problems were had since everyone just kept to themselves (mostly)
Trap was never meant as a jab at trans people, trans weebs even seemed to laugh along with the "traps are gay" meme, and as a result the word took on a new meaning from its origin, likely coined satirically
A community has a right to determine the language that it uses, and how that language is used to communicate their ideas
and trans charactors are just their choosen gender
trap is more just a guy/girl dressed in the oppisite genders clothes
similar to in english
if they are trans charactor they are just reffered to as there chosen gender
and dansou for vice versa
instead its just josou when a guy is dressed a girl
i dont know but in japanse but in japanese there isnt really a word for trap so it hasnet really been a problem
also being trans isn't a sexual orientation, it's gender identity
sure but why is it so important to use that one word/phrase when a community it's frequently turned against overwhelmingly says it's hurtful/offensive
^
The "traps" anime describes are cross dressing, not actually transexual, and in the anime community almost exclusively used to describe a character archetype and not a ~~sexual orientation~~ gender orientation
kinda the same way I view non-black people who get mad when people tell them they can't say the n-word
imagine being that upset about not being able to use a pretty derogatory word
like
I get the humour of being like "are traps gay" or pointing at someone's waifu and being like lol sike you're gay they're actually a guy, but I just don't see the point of being this mad about the term being classified as a slur
she still hot tho
i dont care what they say Haku will always be a trap to me
I think it can be a slur, but only in context of an actual trans person
if they find the term genuinely offensive then it should be banned
They overwhelmingly say yes
ask the trans community
me and Gabe spent 2 hrs talking about it
that's not up to me
Fine, is Trap a slur?
I just don't care man lmfao
Where do you guys stand?
Users have commented evidence of problematic leadership and decision making in the mod team as early as 3 months ago, notably SrGrafo admitting the reason he left the community with the mascot he created was because of toxicity received from the mod team
that sounds canadian
*Hey guys, what a commotion over on r/Animemes, eh?*
I love r/hentaimemes response
Other anime based reddit like r/hentaimemes and r/Komi_san have denounced the rule change as brash and poorly introduced
Members of LGBTQ subreddits have expressed support for the mod team, specifically r/traaaans stepping up and commending them
Trap was a word commonly used to describe a cross dressing male character archetype, one that was revered by the community
why are people mad again?
not a phrase I would use anyways though
I mean it makes sense that it'd be offensive if the person in question was actually trans
I didn't know that
is it a slur?
solid entertainment
its been great
The sub count had dropped from 950k to 850k last I checked, and something of a counter successor gained 100k in its first week
The community has been an utter firestorm of posts protesting mod abuse and arguing against the rule, and has been going strong for almost two weeks now, which is extremely impressive for a reddit sub meltdown in my experience
Anyways, since I'm guessing only three of us are, basically the mods implemented a rule banning the term "trap" in observation that it was a slur against trans people
is anyone on r/animemes recently?
twas
twas
so it's a meme account
ahahahahahaha
whachu got now
lemme fiind the old one 😉
its incredible
I dont have to the one to message first when i match
post your old pfp for context matt
oh how does it boost your ego
i dont really know i have actually used tinder for all of 2 hours now
find people i think look good looking and from their look at their hobbies and what not and try to determine if we would vibe
uh
i'm curious, what's the tinder experience for guys?
and i must say this is just boosting my ego and i dont know what to do with this
by making a real tinder just to see what would happen
I have taken <@!478706068223164416> advice
I feel like that there is a normal ass interaction
No?
Uhhhhhhh
"You too"
"Alright, have a nice day"
"18.50"
"Yeah"
"Find everything?"
yes

I’m just an idiot normie lol
So in a way
And do like the challenges with the templates
Repost things to story
Also highkey I don’t keep up w insta updates so I don’t know how to like
I live like a normal person and that’s how it shows

Salina's account goes pretty hard on normie levels
A YEAR ALMOST PASSED
LMAOOO
I NEVER SAW THIS HAHAHAHAHA
went to stalk you
I
wait I'm dying
that's his ONLY POST
that's top tier
LOOOOOL
not much else to say here
but also Im lazy
the current aesthetic is too nice I kinda dont wanna disturb it LMAO
Man Noah's would be a contender too I'm sure if he had more pictures
a year
I havent made an actual Post in like
that's not normie level output
FOUR
but it's four photos
He has a whole aesthetic going on
I guess so lol
Is this how we do it?
Uhhhhh

what's with that
I don't actually have Jiayi's insta
I vote Helen
After looking at them all
I vote salina, actually, though I'm sure I'm also a top contender
Y'all ever see jiayis account?
helen's post-duke stuff is also pretty normie heavy
in what universe is this a normie account
I was about to say
Just looked at Cindy's
Nevermind
Hmmmmm
Hesitantly me
salina's also a good contender but I'm not sure if she classifies as normie
but it's also hella nerdy ngl
cindy might have a pretty high normie rating
main accounts only
who has the most normie insta here
late night discussion
That was quite long but I mean I feel you and I'm still beyond pissed, but like also super resigned to this hellish timeline for now
And then think about what kind of people would be willing to stick around him for a scrap of power
I mean consider that Trump has credible lawsuits against him alleging that he raped a 13 year old girl, has praised authoritarian dictators and said concentration camps were "exactly the right thing to do", used unmarked Feds with munitions as essentially secret police to put down protests, ignored Russian bounties on American troops, extorted the Ukrainian president by withholding military aid while the country is at war for nonexistent dirt on Biden's son, pushed covid conspiracy theories and pseudoscience cures, is more concerned with his reelection prospects than any semblance of competency, and is currently off golfing while 150,000 Americans are dead
Ffs
How does one do this and think it’s okay
But
Okay no
Are you surprised
Which is twisted on a lot of levels
It displays a clear demarcation not based on one’s humanity, but their beliefs
Really really concerning
The stuff coming about Kushner and the covid response rn is like
Ok straight up

probably for the best
forgot to respond to this and then forgot it happened

The usage of the word smirk there creates so much sexual tension

"Oh, okay then"

wd but it's a shitty american high school sitcom

I agree on doing your own research ngl
I'm very tired rn but I'll list out my picks and reasoning later today if anyone cares, but like, I also encourage you to do your own research
I just got my ballot a few days ago
who are y'all voting for in the local elections?
there's a reason there's a decent amount of research dedicated to wiping them out
they provide very little environmental benefit
mosquitoes are the most deadly animal on earth for that exact reason
mosquitoes is the only succ i get
Mosquitos have actively killed (probably) millions of people by spreading diseases
I'll take more birds over more spiders
Spiders harm me by existing
they just wanna eat your bugs
and the vast, vast majority of spiders mean you no harm
because spiders help control the population of virtually every other bug
decrease spider population 10 fold but the remaining ones increase in size 10 fold
Why would you not take that over no spiders
If every time I got a mosquito bite I got 10 instead
and this is from someone who flipped shit when a huge ass spider crawled out of my toilet scrubber thing yesterday and has avoided my own bathroom for most of today
this may be the most objectively wrong opinion I've ever seen
I would 100% rather the mosquito population increase tenfold than have spiders exist
Lost causes

Never had to listen to the whale mating ad play while trying to show your friend a sick Falcon combo
Matt only watches YouTube alone in his bedroom like a goddamn loser
do you guys not watch stuff on your phones?

Use an adblocker?
O_O
*Dude meditating on a medicine ball*
"Alexa, play my whale mating playlist"
*Whale noises commence*
"God, what whale am I thinking of that goes <insert degenerate whale imitation here>"

i dont remember what the ad is for and frankly i dont care
of course thats not an exact quote but thats the gist of it
whale mating???
i too have been getting the whale mating ad
I keep getting trump ads as well
I know I look into a lot of chill bgm / asmr / relaxation content but for fucks sake google I'm not a whale-o-phile
all I've been getting is the stupid ass whale mating ad
per a conversation we had this past weekend
alex has confirmed to also be getting them
i have been getting them too
It's not even like good advertising it's just shit like "DO YOU APPROVE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP? TAKE THE SURVEY."
I stg half are just trump campaign garbage
Is it just me or is everyone getting a ton of republican YouTube ads
Oh no how disastrous

Only saw video of the tsunami alarm and people walking up hills lol
It hit off the coast of a relatively unpopulated area though so I haven't seen much damage reported
Followed by more than 20 aftershocks, apparently
7.8 earthquake in Alaska
How bad was it?
Well I was asleep so it’s not like I could have known lol
I had no idea about this
2020 is wild
Man
We dodged a freaking bullet
All clear!
Gotta love 2020
Washington & Oregon just got cleared as safe
There's been a major earthquake in Alaska, tsunami warning went off an hour ago
was about to ask when you made that
time flies
wow i made that 7 years ago
game studios can too
if im able to sync it up in FUCKING MINE-IMATOR
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D81Uz1-WlN4
thank you
that's one of my biggest pet peeves
OMG
i will be really fucking bothered
there is any sliding in a walking animtion that doesnt take place on ice
if in any animation
but i will say
not conscisouly
and movies and media in general ig
lol is this something you look at in games too?
especially his dash startup
kinda unappealing
C Falc's run animtion
gotta say
I find what people tend to pick up / think about others' quirks fascinating
great time to destroy those feelings with Captain Falcon
aww
congratulations
i like all of you more now
i find great joy in that we could talk about types of walking so much
diagonal skate
angled gait
a pointed stroll
🙂
more like your shoes are too big for your feet and you have to lift them like weighted boots
i would not call that a march
I have a pointed march
and in case theres any confusion i dont mean straight as in the sexuality
straight casual
i didnt say it was a demotion
fuck ive been demoted from casual to straight
i guess his straight walk makes his square shirts make more sense in context
Straight and pointy
Alan has a very straight idle animation
if you're not moving your body posture is not something i pay attention to lmao
lol
I'll call it an idle animation
[ SQUARE ]
Matthew has a more interesting standing around stance imo
yo <@!110138691388731392> ive been thinking a bit more and i just realized i completely misremembered your walk
you walk really fucking straight. like an an almost odd way. but its also neat and i like it. its a pretty tidy gait
I should go on walks with Alan
and yes that is actually really sweet lmao
I also walk slower around people but it's usually because the people I'm around force me to slow down
I WANNA SPEND MORE TIME WITH YOUUUU
that's why your regular pace (around us) very mildly annoys me
I know you have variable walk speed I've gone hiking w you
oh right you mentioned
he wants to learn the bongos, should he take up an instrument
(I walk slower with you guys because I wanna cherish the time sheesh)
no
does alex play an instrument?
you should find it
I HAVE VARIABLE WALK SPEED
that featured adam neely
alex showed me a video about it
allegedly really really really really hard to improvise over
oooooooooooooooo
good jazz song
I read it as "try walking in giant steps"
https://open.spotify.com/track/47vmcuvMWFIsMaiHFIGSIu?si=tTFc78nLQimpGICRopDDmw
Im confused
wait what is giant steps
lmao
because its called giant steps
i didnt choose giant steps
lmfao
y'know
me in prom heels probably walked at your normal speed
and tell me you're on time
try walking to giant steps
I'M NOT SLOW I'M ON TIME
TRUEEEE ALAN WALKS SO SLOW
i've also met jiani's parents an infinite number of times
Alan walking
you walk too slow for it to be competitive
I've got a competitive walk
fuckin casual
i've passed by cindy x three times on walks in klahanie
im so sorry
you'r whalecum
ty?
my embodiment of a casual walk
ill hope thats a good thing
like
very casual
onitsuka
uhhh
what is my walk lol
I'm glad you guys are still friends
and then I like never spoke to her again I just was friends w jiayi so I'd vaguely hear about shit
> She can certainly have that intense positive or intense negative impression on people
to be fair (again) my impression was from freshman year
Probably one of the best people i know
But still
Also *very* impulsive
shes pretty lighthearted when playing yeah
Very smart
Very driven
Much respect for her
But she's also probably one of the most fun people ive been around
also I'm literal ass t drawing hands
She can certainly have that intense positive or intense negative impression on people
most other things about the human body can fuck right off
glad to hear it tbh
and hoodies
i like drawing eyes and hands
But she's gotten much better
Doesn't stream anymore
Cindy certainly had/has problems
thanks
the eyes are actually really good though
Hmmmm
probably getting breakfast
did you change your pfp?
<:dude:703877417311404042>
he left lmaooooo
not my place to say so but <@!173668455856340994> what do you think
Cindy has "problems"
does she still stream? <:thonk:702395981903429732>
that might be a fair assumption though let's be clear
I mean, I mostly just feel kinda bad for her now
you were correct
sorry
so you kinda got a bit of that by association
oh also I got a REALLY negative impression of cindy x really early on
just keep adding more servers and more friends
that one guy in lakeside and wd who is friends with nick, alan, matt...
Sounds about right
<:ahaha:703872964814438470>
mine was "that one guy" then it was "that one guy nick is friends with" then "that one guy on WD" and it hasnt evolved much since then
that hasn't changed but he also got "fun guy" added
*quality anime
That was my impression of Alan
Whoa
my impression of jarrett was of a tall skinny asian dude who liked anime
and then I just never got to know him till the past year
Happens
Tee hee xD
bad impressions from a long time ago
why was everyone hating on Jarrett again?
In all fairness you were pretty in-line though
fair enough, I think she was an asshole to you, but in all fairness, I kinda was too
Katya fucken sucks at being respectful
thats real nice cindy
Cause man
Disrespect is probably the easiest thing for me
Some people just fucken suck though
I'd prefer that over other options tbh
idk how to explain it right, it's not like I have high expectations for people or am often disappointed, more just that I can find something to like/appreciate/admire in pretty much anyone and am loathe to cut ties with people
do you wanna read the body language book because then you don't have to make assumptions, you just read them from a distance and immediately understand what they're thinking
were getting my leniency
soccer mom looking types
i definitely profiled people at the Y to judge what the chance was that they'd make a fuss when i told them their 4 year old who didnt pass the swim test isnt allowed to be alone in the water despite having a lifejacket in the shallow end
especially since covid makes it so i see practically no one
but i really dont think so
id like to believe im getting better at it
but i dont think i shut out sterotpes well enough/early enough in my life for them not to affect my perceptions
I wish i was more optimistic about people
> as much as im against being prejudiced against people im pretty prejudiced against people
I was gonna respond to this way earlier but funny enough as much as I consider myself a cynic I feel like I actually tend to be overly optimistic about people
🙂
this was a very interesting path to take this conversation down
lolllllll
because it's true
probably
LMFAO
but your legs look like they just werent ready to get out of bed yet
i think your upper body posture is great
so yeah
idk I've been followed a few times and it's terrifying
purse under my arm if I'm using one
eyes always forward
i was bouta say you keep your chin up well
reading the body language book opens up all your subconscious nonverbal cues that you wish you didn't know
shoulders back
chin up
I make a conscious effort to Not look like a good victim
people who are texting while walking
mm
if I was a pickpocket or smth
who would make a good target
but like I think about
me neither
i didnt read a body language book like alan did
im just going based on my image of what "walking submissvely" would be
I was gonna say no but actually it is something I pick up
really closed off basically but not so much so that its a secretive walk
this stuff is real?
maybe a little hunched over
small steps
hands around stomach height
toes in apparently
toes in
elbows in
how does one walk submissively
i walk differently/more awkwardly and rushed when i am thinking alone as opposed to being with people
TIL I walk submissively and that bothers me more than I would like
walk is half of how i identify most people
...........huh
oh well half my duke friends recognize me from a distance because of my walk
your posture is way better than mine though
fun fact extraverts swing their arms more than introverts when they wlak
I don't think you have a super distinctive walk style tbh
http://bodylanguageproject.com/nonverbal-dictionary/body-language-of-splayed-feet-or-feet-pointed-outward/#:~:text=Meaning%20and%2For%20Motivation%3A%20Usually,threatened%20or%20is%20threatening%20others.
i know i have a very distinctive walk style and it's pretty weird
and it bothers me
i just said your feet point really far out
it's literally a published body language thing
i didnt say that
I have an asshole walk
what
oh shit I forgot he was in band
didn't hear/see much of him during hs
I try to exude get the fuck outta my way energy as much as possible
i mostly know sean from middle school band i think
i never knew that katya and sean were a thing
> ok I ask because I feel like I definitely walk like an asshole LOL
this mostly because my whole demeanor changes when I'm alone and have somewhere to be vs. w friends
hello
aw thanks
its kidna cute ngl
your step is a little stumbly to me
Im surprised you picked up on that, most people who notice have known me for ages
where alan's point at like 45 degrees outward
ooooo yeah Im a lil pigeon toed
very closed off
45 degree angles inward
point at like
your feet
nah
i study peoples walks a bit
ok I ask because I feel like I definitely walk like an asshole LOL
idk
with body language that exhudes condescension
but like
mmm confident steps
jaunty steps
but like
idk if im explaining right
uhhh
how does one walk like an asshole
unless i know otherwise
ima think you an asshole
if you walk like an asshole
how people walk is big for me
just based on their **v i b e s**
as much as im against being prejudiced against people im pretty prejudiced against people
huh
i always kinda got the impression from her that she was talking about people behind their backs, although i say that with no hard evidence since she never did so with me, its just a vibe i got from her
I'm obviously biased
idk
a while ago I had her chat with some of my jsa babies who are going to purdue
super supportive and helpful
but she's also actually.... really nice when you do get to know her
and yeah, she is crazy smart. just a lot of fun to talk to and debate and hang out with imo. obviously she has her faults don't get me wrong, she can be pretty insensitive is a big one, and I don't think she's the easiest person to get to know
On the first one
I guess so
Huh
she's genuinely one of the funniest people I know
she smart
One good word about katya to spice it up
Give me like
Bruh what
well, I think I'm the only person here who still considers her a good friend
damn ok
really??????
To be also fair I dont think I've ever heard a good word about katya
bc she seemed genuinely sad about it when I talked to her about it
it's not really any of our business obviously but idk I just feel bad
I still don't entirely know what to make of it, or what jeesoo told him, because they've both trash talked katya a lot for seemingly no reason (they seemed really happy when they were together and dated for almost 2 years....... and ended on fairly amicable terms, like had group calls and stayed friends until she found out sasha & jeesoo were suddenly dating)
I guess to be fair the Jeesoo situation was absolutely not her fault
and fwiw they've already been together for at least 6 months
the whole jeesoo situation was/is a yikes
Just wait 6 months
and I thought her and sasha were really cute together actually
Ive heard a lot of good about her current one
the farmer's tan is real
He was nice
I worked with him at QFC for a bit
but he was tryin
I feel like I have never heard anything good about any of katyas relationships
and wasnt the brightest
is that he liked to play smash
all i ever really knew about the guy
but like, lowkey incel vibes
I got nothin really you'd have to ask her
Really curious about that
holy
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh
but you see i look for facial structure
I remember him as the guy who compared their breakup to the holocaust during a soc sem
a buzz cut really makes a guy look different
Jesus Christ he's completely different
what
wait really?
that's katya's ex LMFAO
w hat
omfg
a duder
who is that
wait but
i think
behind the crouching guy on the right
middle right
who's that
oh shit
My question: Which one is he lol
This is his Facebook cover
Sean Broderick apparently joined the US marine corps

Oof
Rep. John Lewis passed away today 😭
prime example: suddenly breaking off from conversations to say shit like "it is so beautiful right now"
I suspect I also can't *really* do both but I can bounce back and forth very quickly / am very easily distracted
you are either my focus or not
interacting with people pulls me out of whatever I'm doing
I can't really do both
I am either doing something
or I am being social
I generally have to split the two
quality explanation
hmm
idk
ugh
which sounds bad and like I don't care about people, which isn't what I'm trying to say either
I'd agree but the reason I disputed it isn't bc I'm comfortable doing shit alone, it's mainly bc I'm generally more focused on the activity at hand / the "what" than the "who" (depends on the situation of course, but *generally*)
Prolly just means that you enjoy yourself a good amount
Well doing stuff with yourself can be a great experience
> "It's not about what you do, it's about who you do it with"
this, funny enough, I don't really agree with, have had a lot of great experiences by myself, which sounds like I'm talking about masturbation but my brain is fried and idk how to word it better
I mean agreed but we may have different definitions of dumb things
the best things to do are dumb things with friends
yes
"It's not about what you do, it's about who you do it with"
One of the things I was always told was
but i appreciate the wildly different perspective
yeah no I don't think I'll ever be able to fully think like that
much to think about
mmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Because the other person made wherever you go the right place
Like it doesnt matter where you go
it's ok I'll treat them as separate things
lol
My cool metaphor
Wait fuck
It's bout the journey not the destination
No?
is that not kinda dumb though
You kinda just follow each other
do you let them lead?
but like what does that mean
wow wholesome content
The destination is by their side
If I'm walking with someone
Nah man
I think this is why I like econ so much lmfaooooo
I was gonna say it's way more efficient to have a destination in mind and now I'm having a crisis thinkng bout how noah said life isn't about efficiency
it's rare that I'll just meander randomly, I will get bored and impatient with myself
but you still kinda have to go somewhere
I like walks
That is probably not the case for most people
That being said I'm a fucking sucker for walks
And you can still interact on the way there
More privacy
And anywhere you go is still pretty empty
We can bike somewhere
Wanna really change the scenery?
Let's go on a walk
Wanna change the scenery?
But that's the beauty of the suburbs
((good jokes to be made there too))
different strokes for different folks I suppose
idk
like, we can sit and chill on the beach! or we can have a deep conversation on the drive to the mountains
but most of the time I'd prefer to do some activity or go somewhere
plus his mom is cool to talk to
don't get me wrong I love sitting around and chilling and just talking to people
he has a great basement to chill in
And honestly I can have a fuckin blast just sitting around and chilling
So many logistical dealios
Cause you really gotta plan that out
I honestly don't really like doing destinations/things too much
a) my plans can be chill or
b) I consciously decided to chill and not do anything more interesting that day or
c) for whatever reason I was unable to do something more interesting that day
but also no
yes??
I mean like
basically all our time
the fact that this is a difficult question for me to answer probably speaks volumes
ah yes, some of our best times
Just to chill
Don't you ever just see some friends with nothing in mind
I feel like everything you do is a dedicated *thing*
back at you LOL
I dont get you at all man
Man
this is how I get serotonin
*see comet neowise at alki beach*
*catch pretty sunset over mt rainier*
*photograph the milky way*
like I tend to be a pretty impulsive person but when I decide to do things on a whim I still have a goal in mind
I'm aware lmfao
good jokes to be made here
*you get to the top*
like this is why hiking and climbing are my top 2 exercise forms of choice
I am unmotivated to do basically anything if there's no goal or destination
jarrett you might have just won that position
but that's just unrealistic
you know a long time ago someone asked who you think you're most different from in this server
I would prefer to live in an apartment and own a shop space
but I know it won't work with my hobbies
I love the concept of apartment life
There's no expectation of going to a *destination*
I need ground level housing to work on larger projects
I love the suburbs cause there is *so much to do*
I plan to live in the suburbs
Bruh what
there's nothing to DO
well ok like logically I get it, kind of. on a personal level I do not
Man I would pay more for some quiet and fresh air
I cannot fathom why one would want to live in one for that exact reason
by their nature they are gonna be more expensive
suburbs can't be affordable
yea that's basically my point
> so what's your answer to people that want to live in suburbs?
considering the realities of the situation - save up, I guess, bc they'll probably always exist if you really want em, but in an ideal world city living will always be cheaper, healthier, and more convenient
because guess what courts upheld zoning, now everyone get out there and write different laws on it
you're relying one the same process going perfectly hundreds if not thousands of times
but that's only that one town that came up with their rules
Kansas in the middle
so I have no doubt there is some town out their doing just as good a job as Japan
lol
it works as well as the people running it do
or actually it does
basically the US system of governmental free for all doesn't work well
why Kansas?
by "suburbs the american way" I mean nothing but single family residences for miles
We turn Kansas city into the biggest city in the entire world by relocating the entire population there and just let urban sprawl take over the entire united states from there
like to be HONEST honest I kinda don't think suburbs the american way should really exist, but they always will, bc a lot already do, and it's part of the culture, and also the states are fucking huge so it's not quite comparable to europe or japan
I just finished reading the blog post
the states
ah yes we run into my favorite American problem
you know, I'm not really sure
so what's your answer to people that want to live in suburbs?
https://urbankchoze.blogspot.com/2014/04/japanese-zoning.html?m=1
1 in 10 people in Japan live in the Tokyo-Yokohama metropolitan zone
I again note
we don't really know how most of these potential policies will play out, and new problems are sure to arise in the meantime, but we do know that our current zoning system sucks, so we should try to change some things at least
I mostly referred to inclusionary zoning as short-term bc it's something that can be changed in the short-term that will have immediate impacts on development
studies have shown so far that inclusionary zoning as we define it right now in America can also lower supply and increase price, but you're subsidizing space for more affordable housing, so it's a tough balance to strike. may or may not be the best approach long-term. again, I bring up Japan as having like, the gold-standard of zoning laws, but I think that kind of thing would take a big shift in our political culture to get to
what's the long term once zoning is reformed?
inclusionary zoning is not without its costs either
short term?
houston, for one
there are even american cities that have done zoning relatively better
well, that's like the short-term band-aid, but yes, plus a serious examination/implementation of the other stuff I mentioned, plus attacking the issue more aggressively in general/raising awareness/developing and exploring more policy options, plus gradual cultural change around homeownership and investment
so basically you just want it to be reformed to be more inclusionary
like, "making it easier to climb" is a complicated question in itself
> Wouldn't making it easier to climb the economic ladder solve all the problems here?
yesish, but again, chicken/egg, zoning reform would make it easier to climb the economic ladder, and I would argue would be a major contributor to that goal
"like all incentives"
the problem is these incentives can be abused
the "American dream" used to involve owning a house, so the US incentivized it
another fundamental problem is that the US heavily privileges real estate as an investment through tax incentives and subsidized mortgages and a lot of other granular shit. tons of peoples' retirement plans is just to buy a house and sit on its accrued value. this is already starting to go out of fashion because younger people are choosing to live in cities and can't afford to buy houses anymore, and the house-buying thing is very unique to America in the developed world... minimizing the role of homeownership as what many would call "the most important" source of wealth would also probably help
Wouldn't making it easier to climb the economic ladder solve all the problems here?
you know maybe I didnt make this clear enough, I'm not saying and never said to not do zoning, despite railing against zoning laws for the past hour. I'm calling for zoning reform. most zoning laws in the US are exclusionary. the immediate fix is to have inclusionary zoning mandates while we look for better longer-term solutions. zoning "budgets", tax increment transfers, stronger anti-discrimination HUD enforcement (the supreme court has ruled that Americans are protected from discrimination on where to live even when that discrimination is unintentional, search *Texas Dept. of Housing vs. Inclusive Communities Project 2015*) are all possible steps to try to move forward
it doesn't mean we should get rid of districting though
districting is a good idea, gerrymandering is a misuse of that though
of course they can be misused
the second part is so that when someone decides to move somewhere they know an airport or racetrack or industrial district isn't gonna pot up next to them
organic growth is often not the best in the long term
the first part I feel we can all agree on, layout can be done well and it can be done badly
na keep talking
ok sorry I'll stop interrupting
and guess what the timing was? around the civil rights movement. lol
but basically I view zoning has having two main points
-set up cities and their surrounding area in a logical and efficient manner
-to give people a sense of stability in their location
there's a name for the phenomenon that changed city culture in the US, it's called white flight
> it is rather sad that suburbs do tend to be inherently discriminatory on the basis of both race and class
the sad part is that it wasn't always this way and doesn't have to be this way
again, the demand is nonzero but would be lower if cities were a better place to live
so this is gonna be very broken up
ok so point to make here
I hate writing
but I can trick myself into thinking this is not writing by sending each sentence like it's a conversation
at least some of them
but i can betcha that minorities would love to live in suburbs too
it is rather sad that suburbs do tend to be inherently discriminatory on the basis of both race and class
if it's reassuring to you (I find it depressing) it's gonna be years before we get real reform and probably years after that to see visible changes
i aint no hick from cabin creek
i mean id rather live in a city than out in the sticks
*sigh* fair enough
cities are loud and smelly
well more or less yeah
.......and you don't want to live in a city, I suppose
cause efficient housing distribution basically creates mega uber cites so that everybody is still near the city center but doesnt pack everyone into tiny apartments and puts rent through the roof
well that gives us a bit of a conundrum
ew discord deletes my extra spacing
> A focus on allowing people enough opportunities, resources, and comfort to grow their income and eventually rise in economic wellbeing (potentially moving out of the cities if they want) addresses problems at a lower level
> Steps taken to address socioeconomics
I feel like I basically addressed this in the section above, it is directly linked because of how education is funded

> Making cities cheaper to live in imo is what we should focus on
ZONING REFORM WOULD DO THIS

> so what is your problem with the zoning laws?
I gave you my condensed 4 points earlier, but I’ll do my best to tl;dr even more: inefficient housing distribution increases inequality, racial segregation, and hurts the environment (which I barely touched on in this loooong response piece but I feel is the most self-explanatory part).
> We could just make newer cities
I mean, there are lots of growing urban centers in places like the sun belt. unfortunately, zoning restrictions are a nationwide plague, and again, hard to get rid of, because for people who *do* own suburban homes, they’re a good thing for them *personally*. who doesn’t want the value of their house to be high? the problem is the overall cost to society.
> the racism aspect certainly sucks but thats more of a racism problem than a suburb problem
racism certainly existed in America before suburbs and zoning laws, but the de facto segregation caused by shitty zoning is a fantastic example of how systemic racism continues to be perpetuated and one of the things we should tackle in breaking it down. I guarantee that if you hear “suburb” you tend to think of white families and if you think “inner city” you think of racial minorities. why is that?
and again, this isn’t just about where you live, it’s directly tied to poverty and crime rates and quality of education – which then links to social and economic mobility…… and I just talked to Alan about this yesterday but I think a lot less people would be racist if they actually interacted with a lot of diverse people
going back to this:
> -the suburbs are the expansion -people want a larger area to themselves, that's the whole idea of getting out of the city
> the point of suburbs aren't to pack as many people as possible, that's what a city does
I should clarify, *limit urban expansion and development
and yes! you are correct that that’s kind of the point of suburbs and that they aren’t meant to pack as many people as possible. the problem is that shitty zoning actively prevents cities from being more efficient with housing. this leads to artificially compressed supply because developers can’t build whatever they want, inflated rent and increased homelessness and poverty, again. I should also note that when I talk about inflated price of land and rent what I really mean is artificially lowered supply – but demand for city living is still high and exceeds that supply. I’ll draw you a supply/demand graph for this situation if you want. the equilibrium price rises because demand is still high and there are *some* who can still afford it, i.e. young software developers in the bay area making 6 figures but still living in single rooms, but as the price rises it pushes people who *can’t* afford it out and onto the streets see: SF’s homelessness crisis. no, life isn’t always about efficiency, but in this case allocative efficiency would probably improve millions of lives.
> Zoning is bad but rich people aren't gonna move back into the city from their private estates, no matter how much they care about racism or the environment
maybe not RICH rich people. like, the demand for suburbs and private estates is obviously nonzero. but my point is that zoning restrictions cause or exacerbate a lot of problems that both create an excess supply of suburban homes and decrease natural demand to live in the city, where, you know, there’s actually things to do and places to work
> debating suburb vs affordable housing is like debating ice cream shop vs water treatment plant
this is a pretty bad take because one of the main points I’m trying to get across is that America’s extreme suburbanization and garbage zoning laws make affordable housing much harder to come by. the existence of ice cream shops, or even a surplus of ice cream shops! does not affect your water treatment plants
> it’s fine if just a few people want that
> it’s really not possible if everyone wants it
I already covered this a little but natural demand for suburban homes is a lot lower than you're assuming. part of this is a cultural thing, yes, i.e. the nuclear family, the white picket fence, it's been ingrained into American society. the bigger factor though is just that a lot more people would choose to live in cities if there was more affordable housing, better schools, better safety.......... the list goes on. MOST OF THE ACTUAL BENEFITS OF LIVING IN SUBURBS COME FROM THE FACT THAT THEY PERPETUATE DE FACTO SEGREGATION. like, take Sammamish, the 2 biggest reasons people wanna live here, especially to raise kids, is bc it's considered very safe and schools are good. the community is considered safe and schools are considered good bc we live in a bubble completely separate from poor people... they get "ghetto" city streets and severely underfunded education while we had a $12m? football stadium built and a median income of like $110k
lemme do this in bullets for clarity:
-the ridiculous number of suburban homes in the US are only profitable because of single-family zoning laws & various other zoning restrictions like lot size standards. the thing is that there IS a ton of demand for the city lifestyle and more and more people are moving to urban centers bc that's where most opportunities are; zoning laws simultaneously restrict what can exist in suburban areas (reducing opportunity outside of urban centers) and artificially inflate the price of land and cost of living in the area (bc multi-family residences and apartment complexes etc aren't allowed in these arbitrary zones). this makes it suck a little more for everyone and increases homelessness and poverty because of ridiculous rent in limited space and limited development, which then also drives wealthier people back out into the suburbs and enforces a divide that gets progressively worse over time because of how education is funded etc........ it does become a bit of a chicken & egg problem
after this text wall
maybe you wont
but
Im genuinely amazed that literally anyone cared tbh
gonna be in interesting read
oh man
I gotta move to a word doc I ran out of words
oh god she's still typing
Steps taken to address socioeconomics
A focus on allowing people enough opportunities, resources, and comfort to grow their income and eventually rise in economic wellbeing (potentially moving out of the cities if they want) addresses problems at a lower level
not weed
like the unit of mass
hey for part of it we were talking about how Jarrett didn't know what a gram was
Making cities cheaper to live in imo is what we should focus on
How have you been talking about suburbs for an hour
but much like we don't need ice cream shop, people still want suburbs
we don't need suburbs
we need places for everyone to live
one we really need, the other is just a nice thing to have
debating suburb vs affordable housing is like debating ice cream shop vs water treatment plant
they aren't affordable because they are an inefficient use of space (this is ignoring the high demand as well)
suburbs aren't supposed to be expensive, rather they are inherently expensive
na if you're really rich you just live in the city but have a house
Zoning is bad but rich people aren't gonna move back into the city from their private estates, no matter how much they care about racism or the environment
thank you
10/10 jokes
you probably need like 3 to 1 to function properly
and the ratio between suburb people and city people isn't the correct amount to support suburbs
and the city only has so much outer perimeter encircle
the problem is too many people want to live in suburbs, but for suburbs to work they need to be built around a city
it's really not possible if everyone wants it
it's fine if just a few people want that
suburbs are like if everyone wanted their own private island
<@!110138691388731392> appreciate the jokes
like vayne
cities do
like lee sin
basically suburbs don't scale well
omg there's so much I wanna respond to and not enough time bc all of you are bringing up different things lmfao
that's the point citys are a better way to do it
do not want to live in a city
actually no
and i really
man its gonna be sheer scale of suburb or sheer scale of city
which was started by a racism problem
na it's not even really a racism problem anymore, it's a socioeconomic problem
I said this at the beginning ffs it's the sheer scale of american suburbs
so what is your problem with the zoning laws?
I find it more easy to believe that people wanting to move out of crowded cities would indeed move out if they had the resources to
suburbs are gonna exist with current zoning laws or without them
I really confused here
but thats more of a racism problem than a suburb problem
right, which is why I said suburbs would still actually exist if I got my way and the "abolish suburbs" meme was an exaggeration
id also like to say that the racism aspect certainly sucks
zoning laws may have enforced them, but they were totally a thing without them
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb#Early_history
suburbs are way older than zoning laws
what?
This is starting to sound like a chicken and egg problem
no that's the whole reason Ive been complaining about zoning laws!!!!!
that's how we ended up here
the free market has allocated land this way
what?
hard disagree, you can't really make a supply/demand argument that's pro-suburbia, because the free market would not allocate land this way
suburbs do not
while cities work fine if more people want the lifestyle
I see the larger problem with suburbs being that too many people want that lifestyle
living life isn't all about doing things the most efficient way
yes
yes
and you think "people trying to get away from compaction" is worth the environmental damage, economic inefficiencies, increased income inequality/reduced social mobility, and de facto racial segregation caused by single-family suburban zoning laws?? I don't think it's a justifiable trade-off at all
suburbs are basically saying "I want more space and I'm willing to pay for it in both money and commuting"
city housing should be cheaper than suburb housing because you are sacrificing efficiency of space in a suburb
so they surround the city
but they have to stay close by because that's where jobs are
the suburbs are people trying to get away from that compaction of the city
what exactly is the point of suburbs then
the point of suburbs aren't to pack as many people as possible, that's what a city does
-the suburbs are the expansion
-people want a larger area to themselves, that's the whole idea of getting out of the city
kinda everuthing
also I said that earlier I find it funny you're just responding now lol
We could just make newer cities
which part is confusing
what?
> -increased inequality and reduced social mobility (because suburbs artificially jack up the price of land and inhibit expansion, and zoning keeps affordable housing out of areas with minimum lot size reqs)
it's so  I N E F F I C I E N T
cars are cool and I love driving but ideally cars would never be the primary mode of transit
if anything zoning reform would likely be a form of deregulation and pro-market people should be in favour of it
I know, I was just throwing my ideas into the ring
I am super pro-capitalism and anti-socialism so obviously i also support private ownership
Multi-billion industry with centuries of history and a staple of American culture
> For reference, I still believe in private land ownership
also this has nothing to do w it
it's all connected
public transit sucks because people in america live so spread out (see: suburbs) and there's fuck all in the suburbs besides residences (see: Sammamish) so there's very little incentive to make better transit which perpetuates car culture
isnt this more of a public transportation issue then and less of a zoning issue
zoning and suburbia literally causes modern segregation
`-increased inequality and reduced social mobility (because suburbs artificially jack up the price of land and inhibit expansion, and zoning keeps affordable housing out of areas with minimum lot size reqs)
-increased racial segregation ("good", predominantly white, suburban neighbourhoods vs. often overpoliced inner city situations - stark disparities that are really hard to overcome, not even getting into how education is affected too bc in the states it's funded through property tax)`
2 full points out of the 4
that was like
income disparity does play a large role which is exactly why less suburbs should exist and middle to upper income people should also live in cities
For reference, I still believe in private land ownership
As for the suburb discussion I would argue income disparity plays a large role, that we should have suburbs to fill the middle to upper cost range of the housing market, and that the issue with public transport is more so the fault of American car culture and consumerism

I missed something but I stand with Cindy's stance on your bread habits
M. True enough.
Non-baking cultures
Indian stuff
Mostly Asian stuff
Just dinner things
I dont bake
Aha
Eh. Delicate desert dealings require scales.
Its 2.1 teaspoons instead of 2
Like oh no
But I dont think a slight mismeasurement has ever ruined anything
I do cook so you know
see what I mEAN
No toaster in my dorm
Nope
Is it at least toasted?
I hope
Literally dozens of us
Apologize to everyone who eats plain cinnamon raisin bread
Hey
but then I remembered you eat plain cinnamon raisin bread so I cant trust you on anything related to food or cooking
I do like the cups tho. I always forget to tare.
that kitchen scale >>>>>> measuring cups
Thought "ahhhhh the science lab scales"
I was gonna bring up
Googled kitchen scale
In the kitchen?
you mean my cocaine scale?
You don’t have a kitchen scale?
That's the only thing in my house that can weigh things
But yeah
Havent seen it used in more than a decade tbh
Apparently often enough for my parents to buy one
how often are you sending letters with enough stuff in them to justify weighing it?
yea but like the post office lets you weigh it then pay the exact amount
Stamps.
you weight letters?
The only thing I have in my house to weigh things is one of those things for letters
thank god you're not doing engineering
For precise stuff it’s better to weigh.
If it’s too packed down you don’t get the right amount.
Do we not measure flour in cups
Uhhhhhhhh
Nah. Like with flour.
that's volume
Cups and tablespoons and whatnot?
It’s important for some baking.
4 crack
except myself
Do you not just buy like
personally most things
crack
Bruh what do I measure in grams
lmfao
she made the joke first
ah shit
it's about $20 dollars
you'd make a shit drug dealer
it's a gram
yikes
bruh
Considering I dunno wtf a gram is yeah that would be pretty hard
because what are you gonna do, ask them to track their every meal
the alternative is to try and poll people, which is much harder to get accurate data on
ooooooo
which is actually a really smart way to do it
amount made in the country - exports + imports - losses = amount eaten
interesting way to figure it out
I'm surprised the aussies beat us
Well generally speaking
Im pretty sure very few hkers are farmers
Hong Kong has a lot of livestock farming?
ehhh?
I'm pretty sure this is just basically a map of who farms the most livestock
link is slow as fuck though
and also most asians eat a lot more seafood than the avg american I think
https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/daily-meat-consumption-per-person
pulled from the UN actually
HK bbq is also amazing
^
Breakfast lunch and dinner
Imma assume it's cause almost all cantonese dishes have meat in some form in them
Im curious what they count as meat
they are *wayyy* out front
da fuck is Hong Kong doing?
also Id argue that large bbq IS efficient but hey
Cities also loud and smelly
white picket fence BS and all
I think the cultural problem is more that Americans have internalized the idea of a suburban house being the best way for raise kids / the most family friendly thing
none of those are especially efficient, but they are a part of US culture
And it would be kinda nice if i lived close to the city if i could be sure that where I lived didnt become part of the city
it's also a cultural problem, people in the US like trucks, houses, and large bbq
Yeah and Tokyo also happens to be the biggest city in the entire world
again I'm not saying to actually delete suburbs from existence, I know that's highly unrealistic and also probably inefficient bc there will always be demand for em by people like you. BUT there shouldn't be nearly as MUCH of it as exists in the US. Tokyo has very little zoning regulation, for example, and is more densely populated and efficient than pretty much any American city because of it (and also comparatively affordable). zoning reform is super important, if a bit boring as a topic for most people lol. unfortunately it's really hard to pass bc it requires adjustment to the incentives of homeowners (and one of the most unfortunate realities of politics is that people are instant gratification monkeys and HATE sacrificing now for the future, see: boomers on climate change, failure to ever actually use contractionary economic policies........... the list goes on)
Cause where else would i live?
I like suburbs
I see your valid reasoning and would like to present a counterargument
-inefficiency because of increased labour immobility (see: shit public transit in the US)
-increased inequality and reduced social mobility (because suburbs artificially jack up the price of land and inhibit expansion, and zoning keeps affordable housing out of areas with minimum lot size reqs)
-increased racial segregation ("good", predominantly white, suburban neighbourhoods vs. often overpoliced inner city situations - stark disparities that are really hard to overcome, not even getting into how education is affected too bc in the states it's funded through property tax)
-environmental cost (everyone having their own house is bad for the earth, who knew. more land gets used less efficiently. also going back to shit public transit, everyone also has a car)
they should also stop people from building houses next to something ridiculous then complaining about it
the basic point is zoning laws stop people from building whatever they want next to your house just because they own the land
well yea but they won, so now there is a tower that monitors the sound limit on one side of the track, the solution is to make your exhaust pipes point away from it while you pass
4 major issues:
America's (and Canada, to an extent, but not even to the same extent) garbage zoning laws artificially create WAY more suburban sprawl than necessary or efficient
*anyways*
except that those people are dumb
then got mad that is was loud
the noise constraints exist because people decided to build houses next to a race track
these are called Laguna Seca pipes, because of the fact you basically need them to run your can at Laguna Seca due to the noise constraints
what the fuck is that
zoning laws could have stopped this from becoming a thing
the actual wording was a bit of a dumb in-joke bc of dumb shit republicans have been saying:
`Trump attacks Biden's housing desegregation proposal as a plot to 'abolish our suburbs'`

moderate dems pushed back like "literally no one actually wants that"
and I mean technically I'm not *ACTUALLY* advocating for the banning of suburban development, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't actually want suburbs to mostly die, and this is one of the issues that I am actually pretty radical on lol
yes I think zoning laws are a good idea
ok having double checked zoning laws are what I think they are
Or a suburb that will soon become urban hell
I just never want to be stuck between living in urban hell or the sticks
Guess my mind shoved an "i" in there
"so can be wrong again on something"?
Hey I liked that comment pre-edited
but his last opinion was still wrong
lol
this is just his opinion
oh wait, nevermind
I shall never like it
so he can be wrong again on something
I will tolerate a city
Swear to god I will never live more than like 3 years in the city itself
*Jarrett has joined the fight*
to which I would say, your status made none of that clear
but based on your question about zoning laws I assume this isn't really the point
and the reason they look the way they do is it's the most efficient way to pack families into a space while everyone still has an independent home
which is what suburbs are
an area very close to (generally surrounding) the city where people can commute to the city "easily" from
right next to it
so where do you live if you need to go to the city everyday, but don't want to live in it
in my opinion suburbs are just the natural consequence of trying to fit more people into a city
-not everyone wants to live the city lifestyle
-cities have physical limitation to how many people can live in them at once (which can be pushed further, but sacrifices and advances need to be made)
so you have people that work in the city but don't want to live in the city
oh yea, still think it's a dumb idea
Abolish suburbs
if I'm honest I fogest exactly what your status was
<@193229269076279298> why are you pro zoning laws

I'm not sure what you'd even do w the money at a certain point, most seem to just sit on it for generations
plus like you could take away 80% of that fortune and change very little about their lifestyle in a lot of those cases
the amount of power concentrated in those hands is terrifying
I've generally always been more on the side of "they earned that money who cares" than "billionaires shouldn't exist" but I've been doubting myself more and more on that one
everyone will have rubbed shoulders with literally everyone else there
by "that" I meant "the aforementioned"

in general I like bill gates a lot and don't want to believe he's a shitty person. nothing directly implicates him in anything. but I also kinda doubt he's as squeaky clean as often portrayed
they were both extremely wealthy philanthropist and being an extremely wealthy philanthropist is a rather small group that seems to work together a lot

i remember reading from Sapiens a quote that was like "if you were a young man in a tribe XXX years ago you probably thought you were pretty attractive because most of the other guys in your area were old and wrinkly or they were little kids"
but yeah i agree that a lot of the issue is even if you look objectively above average you might not consider yourself particularly attractive because of standards
Welcome to the hellhole that is my self-image
Oops
So that’s just me
Oh
for me i always believe when people compliment my appearance because i don't hear it often so when i do i'm inclined to believe they mean it
And even if people compliment your appearance, there’s this niggling bit of doubt that goes “they don’t really mean that”
I feel like a huge part of it is this idea that you won’t measure up to what you find beautiful
same, i think most girls want to improve their image to fit in with other girls
Noah can tell me I’m beautiful all fucking day long and I’ll still nitpick at how I look

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blBIfNyzKnY
Uhhh, what's gona happen now
I'm screaming
I've said it before with the topic of abolishing police - what I think would happen if the police were to just poof away, something would replace it. It could potentially be things like neighborhood watched but propped up, it could be another kind of police that learns from the past and is better, or it could basically be militias which is probably worse than what we have now
chop chop
I find it ironic that people are still acting like CHOP is a country when they literally changed the name to emphasize that they're not actually autonomous or trying to secede
Nothing in life is free and that applies to policy options of all kinds, everything is always a trade-off
Yeah of course
One thing I do like about that video I posted is that he says that there is going to be no solution without costs. Definitely an important thing to consider.
I don't think it counts as one
Unrelated, but I think it's weird when people talk about CHOP as a country
At least change is happening!
If any city's gotta be the guinea pig MN is a good place to start
And it's slightly concerning to me that they don't seem to have a plan for that at all lol but hey
Minneapolis actually *is* abolishing its police force, but there's no way they aren't gonna replace it with something to fill a similar role
I think it should be an option as a gateway to completely restructuring how we think about law enforcement, starting from scratch and rethinking the whole department, but not as an end-all-be-all solution
> I think abolishing the police is definitely an option that should be considered but it's unrealistic to think of a future without some form of law enforcement
To elaborate on what I said here: I think law enforcement is necessary. Lots of abolish-the-police activists are saying we don't need them, let's focus on reducing crime in our communities instead. Which I support! But a) there's always going to be some crime no matter what you do and b) crime reduction through social supports takes years, it's highly unrealistic to abolish the police immediately
If abolishing the police were to become a thing, I would want to know [exactly] how that's going happen and the risks it would present.
I think the smartest thing that we could do right now is ban like tear gas and stuff like that (heck, seems like that even violated the geneva conventions) and redistribute the funds given to the police to other more pro-active like those helping homelessness.
I don't it should be done either. For me it's like one wrong move and suddenly you have a power vacuum that many with a gun would fill in.
Personally, I don't think abolishing the police is going to happen anytime soon
They legalized marijuana and it's not like the entire state went crazy over it.
Kinda like what happened in WA I guess
That's a good point
De-escalation training is one of the easiest and proven ways to reduce the use of violent force, for example

I think that's most of my kinda jumbled thoughts on the issue
Portugal is of course the flagship for this
Another kind of police reform but kind of just legal reform that I think deserves more attention right now is the option to decriminalize drugs
In general it's accepted that VPD does a much better and gentler job of handling drugs and homelessness than most down south, hell we read about this for a whole sociology module
So I guess I'm curious how most Canadian officers feel about all this since they're definitely complicit in some respects but, I think, somewhat unfairly lumped in with their American counterparts in others. I think the stat is that Canadian police kill 30somethibg people per year while American cops kill 1000+
The contrast between my experiences protesting in Vancouver vs. friends protesting back home has been night and day. Montréal is the only place in Canada where BLM protests have been anything but perfectly nonviolent. Cops have been present at every rally I've gone to, but they've kept respectful distance and mostly just direct traffic away
HOWEVER, even that sign does acknowledge that Canada IS better in this respect... And that's pretty undeniable. The only place in the country where police violence even vaguely approaches the same level as the states is Montréal, whose police notoriously suck, and it's largely bc Quebec has different laws and culture than the rest
I've also been outspoken about the problems of racism in Canada because it's true that Canada is not innocent; we have a lot of the same problems. One of the coolest signs I saw at protests was like "fuck Amerikkka, Kkkanada is not much better"
Side note I also kinda really want to talk to some VPD officers about how they feel about the now-frequent calls of "defund the police" and "fuck the police"
Not to mention that the point of 8cantwait is that those reforms can be enacted instantly/unilaterally by mayors or police chiefs, while bigger initiatives will take much longer
I think abolishing the police is definitely an option that should be considered but it's unrealistic to think of a future without some form of law enforcement
Or say shit like "we can't reform we have to abolish"
And tbh it really irritates me when they bash initiatives like #8cantwait
Idk if many of you are exposed to the same ideologies but a lot of my friends are QUITE left-wing, like, borderline if not proud marxists/socialists
Additionally, I see the movement to defund/abolish police as a much more long-term thing
For one when I had that debate with Alan like a week ago we talked about how certain % funding cuts are probably just unrealistic since most of the money goes towards administrative shit rather than actual weapons etc, though I definitely think that said weapons etc should be removed from their budgets completely
I've been pretty outspoken about supporting defunding the police, but I'm a bit more cautious about the defund/abolish initiatives than it might seem
But I agree with most if not all of the potential reforms he mentions
Idk if I can call the policies he presented his "points" or even "suggestions" bc he was trying to be impartial and just stating possible routes instead of advocating for them
Tbh he didn't really say anything I didn't already know lol
Finally got a chance to watch the whole thing
I think he's smart and has good points, I would like to talk about it.

😱
OHOHOHO
it's gotten better for my love how he didnt exist
<@!470822754262712329> do you need jesus?
to be even more relevant he should have just said Jesus
I forgot how about sports puns

<@!470822754262712329>

is that seriously a spontaneously generated message???
But also
HELEN YOUVE BEEN IMPLICATED
Why are we being targeted
LOLLLLLL

Ok damn I was feeling it but now I gotta agree w him, shut up
seems a bit underhanded to talk about this
Alan you dirty dirty boy
y ikeroo
right under the dinner table too
I'm sure plenty of guys can, just not during the actual event

look at least I can brag I got my dick wet on homecoming night okay
Still a touchy subject I see 👀

haha
I am uncomfortable I am not gonna elaborate
are we assuming everyone who has been in a relationship semi-recently is not a virgin
hhhhhhhh 😰
But I feel like it's fairly obvious
or, well, a non-virgin hunt
I'm not gonna say anything
i get the sense that this should not be a difficult hunt
i'm on a virgin hunt
preposterous
i need to pin who here is not a virgin
holding hands before marriage?
Exterminate them
Filthy sex-havers
that was only semi-joking btw
https://tenor.com/view/kermit-sipstea-tea-gif-8953704
whaaaaaat there are people who aren't virgins???
Also lol Jarrett I see u
no i understand it over text too lol
If you're referring to everyone else being a virgin I'm pretty sure that's not true
Im projecting my voice through text I'm 100% sure youd get it in person
Cindy taking over my sleeping spot
i'm just joking
ngl
this feels like a cheater trying to explain their actions
Wdym
cindy, you are the only one who can understand that difference in tone
that's some vehement denial you got there
*hmm*
I slept w Jiayi I did not SLEEP w jiayi
i know how that sounds
fuckin hell i'm still kinda salty that the team IA i carried is what sank my grade
Questionable
HL gang rise up
That sounds
lmao 11th grade math
lol i have pictures of cindy and jiayi sleeping on the table together
dark times
lmao 11th grade math
A solid 30-50% of the time
Even though we were actually asleep like
That was a fun group
probably
well and the door was in the back right instead of the back left
I remember chilling w you Jiayi and was it Katya?
and the fact that you were even in my math class at all
i only remember because of the seating position
yep ramsey
Bro Jiayi and I were probably asleep I don't remember shit LMAO
Was that Ramsey?
Which lent itself to the nerd look
Wait who was the teacher
11th grade math
Cindy used to wear her glasses really low
cindy characteristically was not
you were probably paying attention to the teacher
i remember the useless shit
chances are i don't remember
if it was an important moment
perhaps but i don't remember
pretty sure <@!340319804747415553> was also there to witness
<@!503787499605458954> may remember this
my best nerd moment was doing a "push glasses up the nose while squinting comically" during 11th grade math
YOU KNOW THIS
that's me like a majority of the time tho
Kinda
Sweatshirt,glasses, and ponytail you
Glasses are a strong factor
a rolling garbage pile encased in sweatpants?
then what am i
wait do i not look like a nerd
Cant look like a nerd with a leather jacket
in my book, dressing lazily != nerd
Her clothing really makes or breaks it
when does cindy look like a nerd?
https://tenor.com/view/excited-attack-on-titan-titan-titans-running-gif-14026658
me trying to figure my life out
People who look like nerds: me, jiayi, Alan at times, Cindy at times
salina would be the titan
Hm
you don't really look like a nerd now
then does that make me the god of the god
if i am the source of the god
I looked/look like a nerd
so uh
I don't think I looked like a bitch I think I acted like a bitch
lmao
REST IN PEACE 🤣 🤣 🤣
That's not an inaccurate description tbh
haha yeah i basically knew her as "salina's friend" ~~who looks like a bitch but seems kind of cool~~
> i was a top tier academic carry back in the day, fight me
I have never once denied this, in fact I am very much in support of it
jk ily
i introduced everyone to this ball of ~~sunshine~~ flaming hellfire
yw
i was only aware of her existence in second grade
That applies to a lot of people I've known since elementary/middle school
Lmao
You always just kinda *existed*
i was a top tier academic carry back in the day, fight me
I don't remember meeting Helen either tbh
What me?
Expunged that from my mind
Cindy is like a god in that she's everpresent but nobody knows where she came from
and i was ON TOP OF THAT SHIT
cindy lived on 1) stuff and pray and 2) not writing down the dates/updating her table of contents
I literally
Oh GOD
oh is it the thing about getting to class late
the sci notebooks
ISNs? i remember this term vaguely
Luckily I proved myself wrong 2 years later
so. many. times.
I have zero memory of meeting Cindy
i bailed you and melena out of ISNs so many times
I think I just thought I was Smart ™️
you were
yes
Kinda hypocritical though since I was a MESS in middle school
REST IN PEACE 🤣 🤣 🤣
rip?
Other thing I do remember being annoyed that they changed the humanities plus system in 7th bc I kept having to work w people who didn't really give a shit
Bruh how do y'all have such clear memories
i think he was also in our sci class
all i know is that it was a corner
REST IN PEACE 🤣 🤣 🤣
Rip
or maybe not
i had to sit w him and dyuthi in the back of the class for a while
I just started thinking about it and then I was like ???????????
we met him in leonard's math class
math class
I have zero recollection of when I first met Jarrett
Wait ok I just skimmed through this 2 things
idk
what is that
~~^^^^^~~
~~vvvvv~~
i once listened to a clip of modern greek and it sounded like spanish
and egyptian
and arabic to an extent
fran shut the fuck up
~~( °w°)~~
actually greek might still be kinda useful
this is when the latin comes in
very belated
well
\~~ message here \~~
because i be as i do
travel 1000 years and no one will understand your language anywhere
how could you be like this
:(
obvs
it's a personal attack
lmfao
im congratulating her success
its a clap
fran you're so mean
:(
<:oroClap:554196349164191760>
ah too slow
ah i see
also helen you need another ~

is this not basically dr stone

i've done that before and it didn't work so i didn't try it this time
on each side
~~ <@!472541429130854421>
good luck speaking to 1020 AD alan who speaks Taishanese
dammit idk how to do strikethrough
~~and happens every day in the kpop world~~
which does happen very occasionally in real life
good luck
try to explain technology to someone from the year 1000
would be more interesting if you met someone that looked exactly like yourself
in that AU, the only acceptable option is to indoctrinate them into being a copy of your friend
indeed indeed
"scans mitochondrial rna" 
wow, i descend from my grandmother! how fascinating
AU: you're transported to a world 1000 years ago, you meet an ancestor of one of your friends that looks exactly like them
love that for us
so yay
also mitochondrial rna doesn't work bc that's traced from maternal line
since i don't have a y chromosome, even if genghis khan was actually my distant ancestor i likely have little relevant dna from him
since the y chromosome usually passes on directly without mutation
there's no way to tell if you're descending from genghis khan unless you have a male ancestor who is confirmed
yeah lol
uhhh genghis khan
i'm waiting for the day when there are DNA tests that work well for asians
tru
that works too
you know
i thought you wrote bleach
yeh, we have blanco, blanche, weiß, and many more
r ip
i keep forgetting white people have ancestry other than just "white"
lol
:p
that's a half-answer at best
jkjkjk
<@!193229269076279298>
i think you'd have to ask an italian for the most comprehensive answer
huh
when classes have discussion sections some people make friends there but i've been too much of a shut in for that lol
^this is the shit we do
is a single ravioli called a raviolus
question
it's dumb but fun
even in small lectures people just enter and leave without really interacting
we debate food theory all the time
i'm just glad i have my frat at this point haha
yeah large lectures tend to be like that
uw classes are not conducive to making friends
honestly i miss having classes w yall
:)
honestly i didn't much care what other people thought about the change, i was just glad to be in the same class as my friends
YIKE
yike
i'm pretty sure cindy was one of them
but i do remember some ppl being v pissy about it
oh i was honestly glad it made it less exclusive
i remember everyone in humanities plus was upset because that made it less selective lmao
and i was really happy about them switching to honors humanities or whatever it's called in seventh grade
yeah i was really sad about it all year
fuck you starbot
r ipperon
REST IN PEACE 🤣 🤣 🤣
ripperoon
aw :(
i thought i was going to start caring in middle school but got demotivated in sixth grade when i wasn't let into the humanities plus program while all of my friends were having fun in it
oops
but i didnt know that the stanford mattered
i did super well on cogat
i remember that i wanted to get into merlin and then i didn't
i mean...i'm pretty sure most elementary school kids don't really care about scores all that much lol
studying is for pansies 🙂
i never grew out of your younger phase
and now i am a potato
🤔
and then middle school hit me and i was TIME TO STUDY HARD
when i was younger i was like I DONT NEED TO STUDY AND WORK HARD
yeah bc i laugh at it all the time honestly
wow you remember the specific number and  names of the test
i remember being really surprised
got into sage even tho i got a 76th percentile on the butterfly stanford test section
yeah i like
highkey haven't talked to her in a hot hot sec
lol yeah you'd know who was in sage at the time
she's p nice now yeah
ah that's honestly who i suspected
it was shirley for the record. but i didn't recognize she was bullying me at the time, and she's a very nice person now
aw that's so sad tho :(
lmfao
:(((((
WHO DO I NEED TO CUT
WHICH BITCH
oh NO
then my third grade friend who was in sage (name undisclosed) lowkey bullied me for not being in sage so i got pissed and had the chance to retake the cogat in fourth grade
i think it was for like reading/vocab
exciting ass times
man oh man
bc i filled in some bubbles in a butterfly pattern
did shit on part of the 2nd grade stanford test
man i remember that i like
went into third grade with my new teacher thinking i'd be retarded since she'd never seen an asian kid with a score that low
sorry sorry
i bet you *endeavor* to be that smart again
Then *Merlin* at Endeavour like the genius that i am
hahaha i failed the 2nd grade cogat test
probably
Sunny hills until 2nd
am I confusing you with another asian guy I got confused with
he peaked early in life
wait what
jarrett was *merlin*
i am stupid don't mind me
No
Alan
wow
Yes
was tina pine lake?
oops
hm
oh your cindy was beaver lake
jarrett was in my sixth grade class
yeah jarrett was even at discovery
Cept jiayi
wait
Literally all of us were pine lakers
take your filthy woodsnacking teeth out of here
What
shun the nonpinelaker
none of us were
i don't think i was around to see that
She went like pixie cut though
5th/6th grade you with short hair was cute imo
traumatizing
Tina did it too
ack 5th/6th grade
if you want to see me w short hair
also
i have a lot more real estate to deal w
she has a short face shape
well she has a significantly smaller face than me
She pretty cute with short hair
I told my Cindy not to but she did anyways and proved me wrong
i've been thinking of trying a long bob ("lob") at some point but during quarantine i just don't bother to change my hair
why cut it short <@!173668455856340994>
i think my face shape can't really pull off short hair super well
BOY CUTS ARE CUTE
nah
You could cut it short
oh that might be pretty cool
to be honest i don't really want to change my hair color but i've been pondering whether i should get a wavy perm or something
i don't think the boomers are gonna appreciate if i walk into work with crazy hair
😆
jeff
my name
jeff
i've had lots of random classmates know my name just from being on facebook lmfao
dyeing your hair a weird color is a great way not to get mistaken for someone else
it's like kind of hilarious now that i look back
i've been mistaken for like every other asian girl
look at this point
that's pretty much how we knew each other back then lol
Jarrett and I have gotten mixed up before, especially in elementary
as for myself, i'd probably say salina. I think it tells a lot that many people in the past have gotten us mixed up lmao
at this point we have pretty different logic and come to different conclusions but i feel like she is one of the people i understand the most despite that
alan and david are a bit similar based on first impression because they're CS guys who seem calm, introverted and organized
in my mind jiayi and fran are a smidge similar because they both give off chill but positive vibes, except fran is noticeably more energetic
jiayi and jarrett's first impressions are quite similar, though i met jarrett in middle school and jiayi in high school. Jarrett seemed more talkative whereas Jiayi was more cheery despite being kind of quiet
it's much easier to find similar people if you only have a first impression of them
that being said, here are some of my hot takes
however i don't even know if it's possible to think two people in any similarly sized friend group are similar; after you get to know them, individual traits stand out a lot more and any similarities will "disappear"
(lol i just brought it up twice in a row)
it has been 0 days since mbti was last brought up in this server
heck, i'm pretty sure none of us even overlap in MBTI personality types
with only ten people i agree none of us are similar to each other in personality
hmmm
interesting conversation
Idk how to explain
You and Jiayi are pretty similar but I get very different vibes
I hate u
LAUGH OUT LOUD 🤣 🤣 🤣
Lol
Probably could be second if he wasnt a CS guy
With Alan at a really distant third
Lmao
Salina in a distant second
Nah I think me and jiayi are like 50-60% similar
Caveat that I don't think anyone in this server is particularly similar to each other
~~It pains me to say but~~ probably Noah and I think we've discussed this question before
Yeah but if we want to say these comparisons hinge on singular differences then that falls apart bc I just can’t w toe shoes
And maybe logical thinking
I would wager <@110137446053736448> is the only one close to you in work ethic
True.
Aint nobody beating my degeneracy
A rare breed to be sure
I think Helen and I are similar in being cse oriented people without our heads up our asses
If you guys want to roll with it that’s your prerogative
I don’t enjoy that shit
Yeah I know
If in a fight of degens I'd side with Jarrett, sorry
<@173668455856340994> Salina is challenging your degeneracy
Just call it sexual assault online ffs
Sexual assault fuckin everywhere
Oh god I watched all of SAO
You wanna talk degeneracy
In that regard he's more similar to Noah Jiayi and I
But he's got a much better tolerance for degeneracy
We’re very different work ethic wise but my logic tends to line up w his a lot
Yknow this kinda surprises me too but I’d say Jarrett
Given each member here, which other member is the most similar to them?
But also why did the last bullet actually call me the fuck out 💀💀💀
i only hit one of the hitler warnings
Fuckin betas get on my level
Wait omg I just saw the rest of the page

Free me from the pain of existence

CINDY BELIEVES GENOCIDE IS GOOD IF YOU DONT KILL WOMEN AND CHILDREN
You got me there??
Not that that's the only problem w genocide obviously but I do appreciate women and consider it unsportsmanlike to kill kids so
Honestly kinda agree w my guy's quote though LMAO
tahts kinda cringe bro

Fun facts of the day
I mean it depends how exactly you define deaths as his fault but in general mass starvation + China's massive population was more efficient than Nazi death camps
oh damn
Historians now estimate Mao's body count at around 60 mil, for the record
power trio
ayy you me and salina
Oop
....
and hitler is 6-11 mill right?

its a change for the better

Gabe is sadly taking a nap, but he would love to have this conversation with you
but some i just cant
i try to watch their ads when they come up so i can get a glimpse on into what some other people think
prageru is strange
idk i gues i just have too hard a time understanding that people actually believe that to believe that they believe it
i know those people do exist but to go so very public about it
i guess im really only going at it now because i just got one about a prageru scientist that taught at MIT and has over 200 published scientific papers and then they're going on about how global warming is fake and there's been very little climate change over his career
but no they do believe what they're saying totally
lol, kinda
but it seems too ridiculous to me
maybe im just rambling and im just ocmpletely wrong
but
not to say there arent people out there that *do* believe that stuff
i get the feeling that they manufacture what they're saying to be oppositionist/an unpopular opinion and get clicks from it
they just seem like straight r/unpopularopinion posts
but honestly i get the impression that they dont actually believe much of what they're saying
they just post those videos to spread their views
im well aware that its not actually a univeristy
i have questions about PragerU, though i doubt any of you guys are experts on it lol
from being just born
i consider that his crying
look he's already beginning to sass people
he was obviously developed as of 7/24/18
well the thing is
iykwim
we dont consider a baby born until it's no longer in development
regardless that would be starbot's inception, right?
it was about a month or two before I had the idea to upload it
some of starbot's code predates the repo
can't you look at github commit history?
2018
fuck
2020?
https://github.com/wenjalan/Starbot
!github
as of now Starbot's canonical birthdate is 7/24/2018
the earliest surviving message Starbot has ever sent
here it is
(here as in on Discord)
there's messages here dating back to months before that
that's incorrect
no
...wait
Starbot was born on November 28, 2018
I'll start
known facts, trivia, etc
is anyone interested in compiling starbot's exploits

that's my boy

yeah
imagine me doing this just for the flex

The knowledge had to die with us
Secrets to being both Asian and tall
what kinds of secrets were we trying to hide from the government
Lolll
what if it turns out we were actually trying to commit group suicide while passing it off as an accident
But suicidal
Were like dude perfect
wow we are so unlucky
We made it happen
Well
And Helen would have to happen to be in the exact spot right under
I just searched it up you'd probably be falling from 40 TO 50 FT UP
Imagine that actually happening on live TV
Called out
Omg
You died from walking under a tree and getting squashed I don't think you're one to talk
Gdi you got me
get with the program, we only die cool manly deaths here
What is with me and the stupidest deaths
Bullshit
How tall was this tree
so you decided to show me the wonders of tree climbing while committing suicide, but decided i should go too
How do you kill someone by falling on them
Did the sim just lowkey call you fat
and then you couldn't handle not being able to handle me not getting with the program
I couldn’t handle Helen not getting with the program
ahahahaha katya is the winner
Lmaooooooo
HAHAHA
Well then
Oh
You kill katya
I die?
guess what happens next
Damnit get with the program
damn, i missed out on the tree climbing
LMAO
I need to know what’s next
You gotta kill Katya in vengeance
that's why i ditched him for the third time this morning

Don't underestimate the high ground
father and son die together
That’s a lotta death
Oooh
REST IN PEACE 🤣 🤣 🤣
RIP bethany, alan and starbot
Wow
like two weeks maybe?
I'd assume several weeks though
probably over a week
I forgot how long these canonically take
too much scaring; not enough killing!!!
Also that may have been anticlimactic but it was also fucking iconic
Well it was a bunch of people but they were all like useless so I assume it was basically just you
Anticlimactic endings
epic
Also remember last time how I killed 4 ppl then fell into a lake
Didn't you kill me??
Why haven’t I killed anyone yet
Man
Jarrett and Helen not going seems very in-character tbh
Me: walk away slowly
Lmao
I forgot the feast was a thing
Lmao
Am I wrong??????
well you killed your own boyfriend so you're looking for replacements
I killed my real bf for this bull
HAHAHAHAHA
WHAT AM I DOING
Wow you'd think it'd be the other way around
AM I DOING
WHAT
REST IN PEACE 🤣 🤣 🤣
Rip Fran
damn, i couldn't make starbot turn on his father
fair, i would have wanted to see that too
I don't give a shit I wanted to see Alex's hot airpod gf crowned as victor
but real me is still alive though
NOT ALEX'S HOT AIRPOD GF
NOOOO
Like at least 2 weeks
I feel like it's been a while tbh
lmao
it has been 0 days since mbti was last brought up in this server
what if starbot could actually count the days between MBTI mentions
Mbti
it has been 0 days since mbti was last brought up in this server
Forgot typing it out myself would proc it though LMAO
how does it work?
Yeah
did you know about that feature?
hahahaha
The bitch is loyal
I like how starbot spared Emily lmao
"it has been 0 days since mbti has been brought up in this server"
it has been 0 days since mbti was last brought up in this server
INFJ traits
Dumbass bitch would def do this
"Alan thinks about home"
i think this simulator is sentient
Digital me spared jarrett’s sorry life
"Alan looks up at the night sky"
Jesus Christ
Ok why are Alan's all contemplative n shit
mood
Alexa play how to be a heartbreaker by marina
or maybe more likely to kill you depending
yeah i guess if you sleep with everyone they're less likely to kill you?
lmaooo
Good hunger games strategy
Benefits of being a whore!
Geez
Hooking up w the anime husband paid off I see
What am I doing with these alliances
how lucky
both versions of me got attacked today but escaped
I see
yeah we never didn't get along
More like they just never cared about each other afaik
Sorry you don’t have to comment on that
Do you guys not get along in this universe?
Jeesoo and I are getting along very well in this alternate universe
Oh my god
*Nice*
uhh they're a threesome now, i guess
Hide in bushes
I just
Lmao
nothing new happened there either
"Gene tries to sleep through an entire day" mood
Man, these deaths are happening very slowly
LOL
"alex park stays awake all night" so nothing new happened
Fucking whore
Alan is now a homewrecker
Stop trying to kill yourself Helen
The funniest is you and the airpod gf
lmao my alter ego ran away from me
there must be a serious security leak in their code
Nadeshiko eavesdrops on Shimarin and Starbot
but true lmao
ooferoni
But then 2 of them were Jiayi and Jeesoo so maybe not a huge accomplishment actually
wow queen
Also damn Bethany won a 3v1
Starbot & Alex is a terrifying dream team
lmaooooooooo
Your hunger games winnings bitch keep up
HOW WILL I FUND MY GAMBLINF
Nice
BUT MY SUGAR DADDY
I KILLED NOAH
Omg
Why are these pairings so funny
I'm hooking up with my anime husbando, lucky me
This is kinda making me wanna reread the books
Tracker jacker venom
i think i must be hallucinating in the game
Tbh I could totally see the Alan/Jon situation happening
Nice
i get to team up with my alter ego and a bot to kill a 2D animated character
Booo
Anime waifu betrays and kills Alan
well looks like I killed the waifu
hmmm...guess what happens next
The new star-crossed lovers? 👀👀
HAHAHAHAHA I JUST SAW THAT
anime waifu and alan was somehow very expected
It's ok at least it wasn't in a 1v1
REST IN PEACE 🤣 🤣 🤣
Rip
sorry cindy you're dead
"Shimarin fishes" nice
This round is wack
Hard to say
if you two were the only people left, who wins?
fair
Yet
So no stabbings
Alan is one of the people who would actually be useful in an alliance
I see u king
only a hug? no stabbings?
Damn Alex got the first kill
COME BACK I JUST WANNA GIVE U A HUG
Looooool
"Cindy stalks Alan"
or grab supplies and run
i think i'd grab the nearest weapon and try to attack sneakily during the bloodbath
yeah so you wouldn't run first
If that was the field I'd have one of the best chances
Ok fair enough
Well
if these were the people you were up against, i'd wager you would grab weapons and supplies first
1st priority is to run and find water
I absolutely would
sure, let it be my alternate universe self
The fuck do you mean I'm not an idiot
cindy would not run first
> I'm rooting for Alex's hot airpod gf
Wait I just realized isn't that just your alter ego LMAO
That never happens lol
Wtf
laaaaaaaame
no one died during the bloodbath
I'm rooting for Alex's hot airpod gf
Let the Games Begin
i added in some people who used to be in the server because i have no imagination, sorry about that
It's beginning
Shimarin and Nadeshiko
Alex Park
Nicholas Rihjwani, Jonathan Chu
Please suggest 13 other people to add to this game
There are 11 of us including Starbot but min size is 24
I wanna do another Hunger Games Simulator with everyone in this chat
maybe
lolllll
are you asking me to change it to 1337

:regional_indicator_c: bitch
!poll "star" "bot" "bully" "bitch"
on either thing
relate
cannot
not going crazy yet which is a little impressive i guess
wow it's been more than a full month since I left duke
you can download without making an account which is kinda lit
I did it
Tsk
Ah Alan only on day 28?
Lmao
*KAGE BUNSHIN NO JUTSUUUUUUUU*
mbti!!! i think i missed all five mentions?
Day 28 in quarantine: MBTI has been brought up 5 times, Cindy is tempted to get a TikTok, Helen buys a switch, and Alan learns shadow clone jistu
idk I don't what the chinese gov to have access to my phone data but that's probably a lost cause anyways
but theres also good stuff
theres a lot of garbage
ive had friends tell me its good
to download tiktok
so tempted
I am
we'll stick to Wen Ren for now and keep thinking about a better name
Jemusu Uenderu
james wendell
Lmao you might as well pick an unrelated Japanese name you like
which, tbh isn't far from Wen
but then Ren would be my family name
sunao being the word for honest
then my options include Sunao which I quite like
what if I broke the rules and used my last name as my given name
lmao
RENREN
Be the mysterious Ren
You can always ditch the last name like how most anime characters only have a first name
Lol
but then we have the Uen Ren problem again
The first sounds more like the original Chinese pronunciation
Hahaha
Uen or On
so uh
apparently the only other reading of 温 in Japanese means idiot
The character for rin in my translated name means morality
I could also opt to use a different reading of my last name's Kanji but I haven't decided yet
Wen Ren
Ren-Ren
That sounds weird lol
but that sounds funny
so I could be Uen Ren
Aren isn't really a name but Ren is
Lmao
Wen Alan becomes Uen Aren
(which now that I think about it, isn't that just my english name then?)
tbh the closest I've come so far to a decision is to use a combination of my chinese and english names
lol
that's almost like how a chinese person would say cindy
sounds like cindy
fun cuz it literally has "death" (shi) in it
シンディ
lmao
or something
Cindy would be SHINDUI WANGU
that sounds so much like it belongs in some european themed anime
RUBIORO
FURANU
that's actually really funny now that I see it
Fran would be Furanu Rubioro
yep it's ヘレン
the same way someone without a chinese name at all needs to go ahead and just use their phonetic name
oh hm
from English to Japanese
from japanese or chinese to english?
your English name would probably translate to "Ri Herun"
kairin means "maritime" in english
it's probably because japanese doesn't have a "lun" equivalent so it just gets lost
this is inconsistent smh
when i translate the japanese version back to chinese something else comes up
Uen Jamesu Aren
if you took my English name only, you could "translate" it to
then again naruto is all named after food
it's just gonna be an obviously chinese name lol
tbh any name is a name
but is that even a name is the question lol
not the worst
li hailun --> ri kairin
(Japanese doesn't have a we- syllable)
my last name Wen becomes Uen
Japanese Kanji all have Chinese reading variants
<@!173668455856340994>
that one's for you
lol
jeff
my name
???
...
jeff
i'm a little surprised that the pronunciation for the kanji version of the chinese characters in my name still sound kinda similar
🤦‍♀️
lol
James Wendell
do you have an unestablished name?
wdym established
I've mentioned the problem before but as someone with both an established English and Chinese name I would need to decide one to derive a Japanese name from
anyways yeah the transliteration problem with names is something I may have to decide if I formally start learning Japanese
hentai protag meme
huh?
Alan about to fuck me, my sister, my aunt, and my lesbian lover at the same time
same with korean
but if it's only my first name it just spits out the japanese pronunciation of "helen"
and yeah Jarrett that's what I was getting at
Kanji is just traditional chinese ripped after all
should be
the kanji is similar to my actual name
a little variation
then again Kanji in Japanese changes readings and can be completely arbitrary when it comes to names
"ri kairin"
see if there's an equivalent
try Japanese
lmfao
yeah it's phonetically right but it just sounds like a korean guy trying to say a chinese name
I've found it works to and from Japanese as well
it probably matches pretty well phonetically
idk throw yours in and see what comes out
I mean if everything is actually Chinese if you go back a few thousand years its gotta right
do names even translate to korean? idk lol
(shit that's actually not as far off as I thought it'd be from Wen Yuehua)
won hwa
*google translates*
bleach my hair and call me
oh god you're turning into one of those kpop guys
<@173668455856340994>
Black voters literally kept his campaign afloat I feel like it'd be a slap in the face if he picks someone like Klobuchar, who's great but EXTREMELY white and never figured out how to communicate w POC
Objectively I still think Harris is the best choice, Abrams could be good but less experience, Duckworth would be great but she could get replaced by a republican so idk
He NEEDS to be smart about vp pick I've said this for months but man if he picks a white woman I'm gonna scream
But everything's up in the air rn a lot depends on how the covid crisis plays out
And people don't actually read policy 🙄
I am still a little worried bc I mean he's pretty boring
The polling says Biden has a good shot, he has the support of 96% of Dems while Trump has 89% of Reps and independents break for Biden, so I'm more optimistic than I was in like early Feb
BUT reporting a few days ago / internal leaks said that some of his closest advisors were telling him to drop
Bc he clearly lost literally a month ago 💀 but I expected him to drag it out
I'm kinda surprised but also not really
Finally
Yep!
Ye
is this for real?
<@!503787499605458954> https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/apr/8/bernie-sanders-suspends-his-presidential-bid/
I know I said I was sick of the news and that is still true but I just opened youtube and it's all over the front page
completely unrelated but holy shit boris johnson is in the icu with covid
Man, this only pinged *after* I downed a giant bowl of sugary cereal today 😂
Lol I’ll do it
i'd tune in to that lol
maybe haha
Maybe I should start an instagram story series
ah i vaguely remember that now you bring it up haha
Yesterday it was a thermos
what were previous days' fave inventions?
just wondering
but i get the point lmao
this sounds like it could be taken way out of context
They are so red sweet and gigantic
elab?
very specific
Today my favorite invention is the domesticated apple
Talk to y'all later babes
stay alive
gl
Got truly horrible back pain rn though so yeah I think I'm gonna nap for a while
I will say it's been really fucking weird being awake for sunrise the past few days
Things have been going as planned so far
By mid this week I should be back to relatively normal
Usually you'd be awake 16 asleep 8 right? I can push that a little farther so I'm sleeping like 2-4 hours later each day
Idk I think it makes sense
i don't think this is good problem solving
....
Every day I've been shifting my sleep time a few hours back bc I'm too weak to actually go a full 24 hours
I know
That's extreme
Whoa
But I'm kinda gradually reversing it
I've been awake since like 11 pm last night? I kinda just sleep whenever I'm actually tired at this point
._.
.... conventional human functioning?
Tbf nothing is normal
normal human functioning?
Idk*
Ifk
Kinda
Is there even a point to having a good sleep schedule now?
You know
ngl
i'm getting p concerned
Good question
But I thought that was well established
are uh you ok?
No
sleep schedule ok?
is your
uh
Or like, sleep for 8 hours
I think I'm gonna take a nap
Welp
it's a wild wild time my buddos
Idk it's wild
parents: PhOTOshoP
You know they have satellite imagery right lmao
I was just like
me: ._.
My sister brought up the concentration camps and my parents were like it's an American hoax!!!!!!!!
my parents: ITS NOT THE SAME also they treat ppl better and reeducate them into societyyyyy
your thoughts?
JP internment
me: so
Literally same on the uighurs
he was like "they do so many terror attacks how tf do you even understand"
DUDE
My dad wouldn't agree anyways
My mom is sometimes like I wanna move back but I'm 99% sure neither my sister or I would visit if that happens
i brought up the uighurs during dinner (big mistake) and my dad got big salty
Sometimes they're more cynical about the CCP than I am but they've also still got a sense of nationalism and sometimes get defensive like oh it's not that bad etc... also my dad would never move back even though he's the main one who says this shit so kinda hypocritical 💀
me: so what were you saying about the brainwashing
me: ._.
my dad actually wants to move back now
same
My parents have the weirdest love hate relationship w china
Lol my dad tells me I'm brainwashed by the liberal media all the time
most, if not all, of the takes--the stupid ones and the productive ones--have been made at this point
i feel like there's such a volume of commentary and news that it just isn't thought-provoking anymore
the current state of news and media is really depressing
agreed
but like yeah
hey hey at least you didn't have your dad shouting at you that you're brainwashed to be anti-china after you've emphasized that you don't think that blame is productive in trying to find solutions
Love the state of the world
I started like 4 diff podcasts about the current situation and lost interest or got depressed halfway through all of them lmao
Idk it just feels weird
so nothing else is happening /s
cause everyones at thome
There is literally nothing else happening rn the Only news in existence is related to the pandemic
lol I gave up ~~days~~ ~~weeks~~ ~~months~~ years ago on keeping up with the news
Honestly this is the most news I’ve consumed in years
Good thing I haven’t been keeping up in the first place?
yea it's quite the bombardment
lmao rip
It finally happened I've reached peak coronavirus news saturation I can't take it anymore I have 0 motivation to keep keeping up to date
see if i get more creative that way
i'm tempted to go down some vodka before making my processor for CS homework
ah the lightweights come out huh
i'm drunk all the time
to go with the huge kbbq dinner we had
water is chemically an alcohol
bit of beer
what did you drink
when you say it that way...
alan is playing animal crossing tipsy
helen is excited about a thermos
quarantine day XX
water i boiled yesterday morning is still nice and warm now
a vacuum thermos bottle is my favorite invention this month
ty
Good luck Salina!!
Ugh I guess I'm just reversing my sleep 2-3 hours at a time lmao
?
Fucking weak
I'm
oh good luck!
oof oof
ahh i submitted my app for my major
my farming skills are ass
good job
i spent most of my morning playing stardew valley instead of doing homework!!!1!
I love sitting in zoom breakout rooms not talking
less of a rip because I was already playing animal crossing anyways
rip
guess I'm done with section for the day
I think Zoom just asked me to update then exited
oh no
aight we're not talking to andrew I guess
lol it doesn't have to be now I don't have a camera set up yet
*let's start the section problems*
*10 minutes left*
secondary concern is that I look like absolute garbage and am at peak crackhead energy looool
ok first of all I don't have zoom we use somethin different
right now??
I wanna fuck around with this as much as possible
can we start our own zoom meeting
:'))
DAMMIT I WAS ABOUT TO SAY THAT
she fall on face
she is grace
she is beauty
literally just tripped and almost faceplanted I am the epitome of gracce
also I'm spoiled bc I have a memory foam topper
I'd also have to move some blankets over which is a lot of effort
that's pretty weird
assert dominance
sleep in her bed
catch me doing twirling leaps on lena's empty bed....... lmao
said dancing around has gotten increasingly creative as I've gotten increasingly bored
time to dance around some more I guess
tv shows put me to sleep
binge the entire thing and then sleep
Witcher?
I'm WEAK
ugh I'm still so tempted to sleep
nice
lol
where did it go
wait
I could totally leave right now
an hour and a half of introductions
ah yes
I did not wake up at 8:20 for this
oh wait no we're ALL introducing ourselves
there's like a 75% chance that I'll have to do it
ah shit the breakout rooms have to introduce themselves to the class
that's all I'll say
props on the drawing
my classmate just shared this drawing with us
bruh
people may get the preconception that I'm a normal person
maybe I should fix that
strangely I don't have any weeb shit on my desktop
yup
lol, don't need the discord notifications popping up I take it
oh god are you that person who accidentally streams porn to the zoom class
didnt want no porn links showing up
👀
never done that before
had to share my screen for my class
*he's back*
"y'all like anime?"
nice like r/Tinder conversations
lmaooo
we all introduced ourselves and now it's awkward silence again
a guy said hi so I proceeded to carry the conversation
is it caffeine or alcohol?
depends
also like a breath away from losing consciousness so probably still the strategic solution
I'm already so hyper is it a good idea to chug this lmfao
IT'S OVER ANAKIN
the best way to win is to start at the top
claim the moral highground now
that's the opposite of The Move
call them out on it, while not unmuting yourself
maybe
oh
it's like 4 people lol
ok
no
do I take the first step
nobody's unmuting
so I can be like that one guy in the CSGO lobby blaring music
oh that makes sense
only for breakout discussions
just get headphones
god I need to get a way to play my music through zoom
do y'all usually unmute during classes??
the answer? not me lmao
now we play the game of who unmutes first in the breakout room
sounds like you need whisky more than a whisk
I am definitely not an addict but maybe it's human nature to wanna get fucked up when there's nothing else to do
also I have been weirdly craving alcohol the past few days
^ nice I'll dothat
JoJo
rip
and it's getting increasingly difficult to actually get up for my mon/wed/fri 11 ams
Yuru Camp isn't gonna fly here
unrelated but shit my quiz section is gonna ask my for my favorite TV show
but like I need to actually do shit while shit is open
at first I was like this is fine I don't really have a reason to change
TRYING TO
gonna pull that all-dayer?
time to spike my caffeine levels
I'm a fool
just made me realize I have instant coffee
that
oh wait
I think I need a whisk though
ok I really wanna try making that viral whipped coffee shit
that's like three of my favorite morning things
I got coffee and lofi and cse
it's going great
I miss you too but I'm pretty much seeing all my friends as much as you now
<@!478706068223164416> how's the listening to music in class going
I miss you hoe
mornin
good morning
I'm pretty good at keeping myself entertained but i'm also super restless lol
the other part is just Inability To Go Out sucks ass
I know I joke a lot about being nocturnal but the fact that it happened so fast and so comfortably that I barely noticed is concerning to say the least
I don't usually operate at THIS weird of a schedule
and youre awake now??
I slept at 6
Oh
but I'd assume people like me, <@!503787499605458954>  and <@!173668455856340994> would be relatively unaffected because we normally operate at such weird times anyway
I know some people are suffering from the lack of things to denote time while stuck inside
really?
might actually go insane over the next two months time is already losing all meaning
probably
I wonder if my profs can see that I'm only ever on canvas at like 2-5 am
i'm out of coffee filters which makes my quest significantly harder
that's ass my condolences
damn what the fuck
I got to like 9 am yesterday before passing out
this is attempt 2 to actually stay awake till sleep at like 10 pm to try to fix my nonexistent circadian rhythm
this capability has almost completely abandoned me since online classes happened
how do you have the willpower to only sleep 4 hours
and this message
I already forgot that happened
in between
been a while since I had to do one
wait so when did you sleep noah
I was gonna pull out the whole statics and free body diagrams in paint
lol
I thought I was gonna have to explain why even though your cg is over your hands it doesn't mean the loading is the same due to the angle of your arms
oh that's what you meant
also I forgot to respond but when I asked if you meant a regular handstand it was bc I was confused how the wrist thing applied to an elbow stand
I've just been up
I meant @ jarrett but damn ok
how else would I be here?
uh yea
did you actually get up at 8??
also you're up too
no
Do y'all ever sleep?
no I'm talking about when your back is bent
that would make a lot more sense
are you talking about a regular handstand
rather than just being pushed on
which are now basically being bent backwards
how does that work
huh
especially your wrists
rip
it's a lot more strain on your body
^
or is arching more stable but just bad for you lmao
if that's less stable then how is arching your back a poor way of making yourself stable
hence it being harder to straighten your back
but that's much less stable than arching your back
you're supposed to lock your core and straighten your back
it's a poor way of making yourself stable
you don't want you back arched
like shit
ah see she does a handstand like I do
what's your sleep schedule these days
trying to do this and falling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTVaAFnYPpg
how did you bruise your knees doing that?
wait what?
wait I did not consider the Implications of that statement I'm just tryna teach myself hand? arm? stands at 7 am bc I'm losing my damn mind
I think I just bruised both my knees lmao
Noah could probably bully me into being a really good person
aw i love that
This is wholesome

when ppl are scared ppl are weird
L
my mom was kinda buying into the chinese gov conspiracy theory of omg it's america's fault
???
it;s like
they've shown me articles about both?
from china or the US? lol
i'm p skeptical of that shit ngl but my parents seem a lil more convinced on it
also there's a lot of news about how coronavirus might be from a lab and it's getting kinda ridiculous
idk what to really think
a lot of people were making conspiracy theories about his death
yeah that's fair
*consequences*
True but worse since Li Wenliang
because
people just don't say it outright
that's been longstanding though
i mean
Though I think people are pissed @ the gov in general too
Yeeee
interesting that this seems to be about regional jurisdiction
rip police cars
Yo holy shit

"<someone> is coming up with guidelines about who should be treated and who should be left to die should hospitals get overwhelmed" <-- rough quote from the news
govna inslee doing an announcement in 15 minutes
on a somewhat related note, we love 4 am registration :' )
I had a dream last night that I shared a double-sized dorm with four other people and I had 7 am classes
(idea from this tweet https://twitter.com/itsTomokocchi/status/1239543968561537027)
prompt: play Akinator, make yourself an anime girl, and answer the questions according to you
fine I'll put it here
`you know who votes, Old people
you know who is susceptible to the Coronavirus, Old people
you know what voting is, large public gatherings of Old people
all using the same voting booths, standing in the same lines, etc
this is how the young take over
now nobody is gonna be voting, cause all the old people that vote will be dead`
🤔 she has a point
Bc rich and famous people are more likely to ACTUALLY GET TESTED 💀
Tbh it kinda has been in a way
ah yes the conclusion we truly needed
the one positive takeaway from the covid-19 infections is that we know the virus is not classist
delightful

It was nice, it read in your voice
oh god
I read it
yeah i can see that
It's basically a huge (but well sourced) ramble
I can't believe you actually read it lmao I'm about to attack edit
Oh nice!
Ngl not my fave article but grats
Grats
I've barely moved for like 7 hours time to crash!
https://medium.com/@cindywang_56117/on-the-2020-presidential-primary-df582de2a8d2?sk=b90e5abc1d479f6152155ff1f1aba757
I marathon-wrote a thing
it's 5:30 am
so
if I'm not off by at least a factor of 20 then I'm right
I'll have to remind my dynamics professor about that rule
ehhh in programming a factor of 20 isn't much
off by a factor of 20
ehh?
nice
hey so my guess wasn't far off
was gonna say
lol
wait it says right there fuck
well you can see under vote count lol
like a hundred?
how many people is 0.2%?
32.7 to 32.5
closest state of the night so far
washington results are trickling out
crazy stuff
so tl;dr Sanders is getting absolutely destroyed and the chances of him winning the nom have gone from ~50% to <1% over the course of like, a week and a half
Biden led polls similarly this time around (actually by a little less) but he's overperforming
Bernie camp was really hoping for another, bc MI is notoriously hard to poll
in 2016 Clinton led by ~25 pts in pre-primary polls, one of the biggest upsets of the year was Bernie winning the state by 2%
that was a must-win for Sanders at this point
Yeah cool
I mean I’m assuming that it’s the Biden looks like nominee
polls in michigan have been closed for less than half an hour and it's already been called for Biden
Explain?
Uh
so what actually happened?
I name my "I'm not happy about it but I'm betting Sanders will be the nominee" as my official worst take in recent memory
this is it folks
sure buddy
<@!470822754262712329> spicy meatball?
Are Chris Evan's character designs I NEED TO GOD
<@!503787499605458954> I read the article you posted on the Bloomberg campaign, it reminded me I wanted to ask my cousin what the current state is around him
> up until college we've basically all taken the same classes, it's gonna be interesting to see how far apart our knowledge areas diverge a few years from now
also to respond to this real quick I feel like we're already living in different worlds lmao
i.e. we're very pro-individual anti-collective. the "American spirit" was a big deal even before that era but it definitely deepened the divide and made it a binary choice
some 44 years of high tension including *nuclear* tension is wont to do that
I do think a lot of American political biases in general are a remnant from the Cold War
yeah
im glad what I got out of school wasnt "communism bad" but "in practice so far communism has never been good"
my guess is that there's still plenty of school curriculums that say "communism bad" but I don't really buy that the government goes much farther than that
am very curious if I'd be able to find much evidence that this is a real thing that happens often and intentionally in the modern day
to be clear I am not dismissing this idea bc obviously the US is SUPER biased, but people who talk about this a lot also usually go into tinfoil-hattery about the deep state etc
the argument for "capitalist conditioning" usually falls into conspiracy-like stuff related to the second and third faces, i.e. what deals are the wealthy making behind the scenes? how much does the government insidiously propagate pro-capitalism ideas?
very fast intro to poli theory: Lukes' 3 faces of power
 1: the "open face" - A has power over B to the extent that A can make B do something they don’t necessarily want to do
 2: agenda-setting - A exercises power over B by affecting what makes it to the discussion table / what ideas are considered at all
 3: psychological manipulation - A exercises power over B by making them do things they don’t want to do, but also by shaping their very wants
up until college we've basically all taken the same classes, it's gonna be interesting to see how far apart our knowledge areas diverge a few years from now
*am lost*
hmmmmmm
I mean it ties into like the 3 faces of power n shit
np
thanks for the explanation
im glad to inspire you?
lmao
kinda wanna do a research project on "conditioning by the elite" now
which was not intentional just kinda happened
I have 0 chinese international friends
anyways. honestly kinda fascinating to see
BUT I MEAN tbf Italy is not an overtly authoritarian state with notorious fondness for mass surveillance and distaste for pesky things like human rights
> do you think that insta story is the person commenting on how the NYT's report on china is a lot more negative than Italy
yeah that's definitely a possibility
a lot of Woke leftists argue that capitalism is only the status quo bc we're "conditioned" from birth to accept it / see it as good or beneficial in the US / see alternatives (re: socialism or communism) as bad or evil
do you think that insta story is the person commenting on how the NYT's report on china is a lot more negative than Italy
a lot of people argue that we're conditioned to favour policies that benefit the wealthy (thanks Reagan) (trickle-down economics are dumb)
oh ok this makes sense
3) disproportionate cultural influence of the wealthy / "elite" class, can range from stuff like think tanks with specific agendas to stuff like the Kardashians setting the trends for how your typical insta influencer looks
2) "corrupt" media / government, people being bought out, spreading of disinformation for specific peoples' benefit (usually for a generous bribe)
1) straight up propaganda, state control of media, blocking off of external povs i.e. N Korea, people directly being told what to think and how to see the world and what's right/what's wrong
> what does "conditioned by its elite class" mean?
there's a couple of ways to look at this
um lack of freedom of speech generally means China is far more "conditioned by its elite class" lmao
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuzPL4fC4y4
what does "conditioned by its elite class" mean?
I was wondering if I should also criticize her targeting "the west" specifically bc like
some chinese students are very "americanized" but others are like "china is god, i hate america"
oh god that adds all sorts of layers to this
she's a chinese international student which makes my interpretation more complex
anyways tl;dr lots of perpetually offended left-wingers say the economics / big bad capitalist agenda shouldn't even be mentioned and that the media is perpetuating neoliberal worldviews etc, this commentary may be from someone who's Woke™️ and thinks normies are brainwashed by the elite or from someone making fun of the Woke™️ cool kids. flip a coin for your interpretation
and in China, the CCP has put even heavier surveillance tech into place to monitor quarantines; lots of speculation that the virus is just an excuse to implement systems they've been working on for ages, and this new level of privacy invasion is here to stay
like obviously the primary issue is public health, that's why Italy's shutting down Milan, but also obviously, that's gonna tank the economy
which are legit concerns! for the record
but I assume they're saying that @ the NYT mentioning stuff like economic risks and personal liberties
I can't tell if sarcasm or not bc I know a lot of people who would say that with complete sincerity :🧐
What does this mean??? I feel like this is sarcasm but I don’t get it
This is honestly iconic
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-teen-influencer-on-what-it-was-like-to-work-for-the-bloomberg-campaign/amp/?__twitter_impression=true
but I would specify if it's like a vastly different country/culture
well, I also talk a lot about Russia and China
when is it not
yeah definitely *I should note that everything I said is US/Canada-centric
especially third world vs first world
i think it would be pretty interesting to see country by country statistics
yes but it's a bit of a chicken-egg scenario, I think divorce has (and continues to) become more widely accepted because it's a lot more common now
could it also be that divorce is a lot less stigmatized nowadays?
in 1970, 75% of married women under 45 said that a good marriage was one where the husband worked and the wife stayed at home. obviously this is no longer the common ideal, so with the composition of marriage changing, a) women have more skills, are more financially independent, and therefore have more options, b) only main reason to get married these days is for love so the number of people who get married in the first place is down, c) only main reason to stay married these days is also for love so if you stop being "in love" w your partner divorce is accessible and increasingly accepted
the major shift in perspective mostly happened in the 70s. no-fault divorce laws became common in the 80s
but the consensus in the field of soci is p much what I've laid out above
obviously I am also biased bc I think it's honestly unrealistic to expect most people to have a single lifelong partner
it's not necessarily world-ending for the kids if it's done right, though obviously sometimes it does really suck
like if the relationship is really irreparable and you aren't in love anymore yeah you should probably get divorced
basically, increase in divorce reflects that people are treating marriage less as an economic transaction and more as a labour of love
I will also paste what I already said earlier, bc I'm kinda busy rn and don't wanna retype it in different words
COONTZ: MARRIAGE FOR LOVE

Historically, marriage differed by social class
Upper class: means of organizing inheritance, strategic alliances
Making sure economic resources were shared with the right family and could be of financial benefit
Other classes: range of reasons to marry, but often included a means of encouraging economic survival
When marriage became about love, it shifted the ground and created a "seed for its destruction"
The seed of destruction -- if people should feel personally fulfilled by their marriage, then when this is not the case, people will want to not be married
Associating idealism in the context of marriage makes people have plenty of high expectations that are impossible to fulfill
a lot of the reasoning behind the new 50+% rate is basically this:
I already had a fairly long discussion about this and related stuff w Salina in the dms but basically it's the topic of some sociology research we're studying rn. obviously divorce rates have risen a lot since the olden days (marriage rates have also declined); I don't actually really see this as a problem
oh sorry just saw this
lmao jarrett
as your resident child of divorced parents
tell me about the divorce statistics Cindy
Omg Kamala finally endorsed can we please get a Biden-Harris ticket I'd be so happy
so I'm writing my next research paper on the war in Afghanistan and going through all the news from the past few weeks has honestly made me really sad
Yes bitch!!!!
It just kinda hit me that yeah I get a say in the election now
filling out my ballot~~~
anyways I accidentally became obsessed with the geoguessr game and idk why it's so addictive but it is
(very tempted to delete this but then you all knew I was dumb)
nevermind somehow I did not know pisa was a city
I'm actually stupid?? what city is the tower of pisa in
Oh god lmao
He actually just linked a 2015 article
This post gave me a mini heart attack
except Mark, who wants to vote for as a joke
not really
no
interesting! my dad is probably the only one I know personally, and he was always like a lowkey one who wasn't *entirely* on board
So that is a really small sample size
Like 5
Only a handful
do you know many trump supporters in general?
Albeit Trump to Biden does make sense
I don't think I know anyone who could flip between the two really
but I think they'd be ok w Biden
I will note that we were all unable to vote until this year and that my parents voted early for Bloomberg. lol
my mom was for hillary (but she's also pretty conservative)
well, my dad
yeah
Really?
my parents fall into that category
I think there's some significant segment for whom it's true
Okay that Twitter comment is a hell of a hot take
OOF
Virginia was the first state he won in a landslide where Bernie was leading just a few days ago - it was called as soon as polls closed with a near 30 point lead for Biden
So uh. Bernie is turning out lots of voters. For Biden
it's been fun thanks for discussing w me I love this shit
Better than my ones with Vishnu
Good talk
same
I should probably sleep
Aight
Good stuff
gonna get an absentee ballot for november I think
I didn't think I was gonna vote in the primary but I ended up doing it
I had my parents bring in my ballot, I filled it while I was at home
Or are you going to at all?
Have you voted yet?
(I just don't think it'd end well)
I made my peace with the possibility of him being the nominee a while ago, I would still vote for him if that's the case
I know I've been shitting on Bernie a lot and I don't really know how to feel about him as a whole but I should note I find him a genuinely really likable person and I get why our demographic loves him
you can be ideologically distinct and still part of the party i.e. conservative vs. super progressive dems all exist, I find him blatantly just using the party to run kind of annoying
I kinda don't because for all intents and purposes he is part of their voting bloc, and multiple times he has run in the dem primary to block democratic competitors and then swapped to run as an indie in the general, which I just think is kinda shitty morally but whatever I guess
You aint gonna win as a third party
But good old two party system
I have a good deal of respect for him being an independent senator
but I've seen a lot of backlash to it lol
I actually think that's a good point of his
by "in certain ways" I basically just mean coordinating the moderate vote against him, not actually rigging the election
controversial take I think the establishment is pretty justified in fucking Bernie over in certain ways bc he's literally Not A Democrat 95% of the time
and for the record, I want to delete it but that'll take time
just how the electoral college works
bc the tea is that I would happily trade millions of progressive votes in places like Cali, hell like Washington, for a couple hundred swing votes in Michigan or Ohio, and I think most pragmatic dems would too
I also don't know if Biden would lose without Bernie's support
Imma guess 70/30 but I really have no idea
on the other, they'll see it as the second time the establishment fucked Bernie over
bc on one hand Biden is less hated
I'm having a hard time estimating over/under the % who ended up voting for Hillary
you know I don't know about that
If Bernie doesn't *really really* endorse Biden then he'll probably lose
I'm gonna go with half will go for Biden and the other half just flat out won't vote
it's looking increasingly likely and it's gonna be nasty as hell
another side note, I'm also pretty concerned about what hardcore Berners will do if he loses the nomination
yeah probably
I think that even if he doesnt win it'll be very likely that there will be a popular candidate with his positions in every future election
side note, how old all the leading candidates are is a big part of why I think VP pick is even more essential this time around
and he still refuses to release his medical records. I think if you've just had a heart attack and millions of people are pinning their hopes on you, they deserve to know how close you currently are to death, but maybe that's just me
it seems highly unlikely, even if he does win, that he'd be physically capable of serving a second term
the other thing about Bernie that annoys me slightly is that I kinda feel like his entire 2020 bid is a bit of a vanity campaign
too bad she never fully took off
I was particularly fond of #klobucharge myself
but yes obviously the dem party would be forced to follow if Bernie wins
joementum is a bomb ass word
I've already heard that apparently Obama met w Buttigieg and Reid met w Klobuchar ahead of them dropping and endorsing
I think we're gonna hear over the next few days how the party apparatus helped create #joementum, and I think a lot of it is a reflection of "we're not gonna fall into the same trap as the GOP did 4 years ago", when Trump won over a divided field despite hand-wringing from the rep establishment
Like the democratic party cant just not throw themselves behind the nominee
the difference is that I think leadership learned from the disaster that was the GOP primary
there have already been tons of parallels to 2016
I think the Democratic party could possibly go the same way as the Republicans if Bernie wins the nomination
this is true and a big part of why people like Bernie; the reverse is true and a big part of why people like Biden. lol
The not playing well with others bit
That's the exact thing that got Trump elected though
also he has legitimately one of the most toxic followings I have ever seen
he doesn't play well with others and has been incredibly divisive
there's also the honest fact that he's barely accomplished anything concrete in his decades in congress
I just also think it's pretty misleading to over-promise to the sheer extent he has
I really respect how he's changed the narrative and I agree with his end goals in a lot of cases
I have super mixed feelings about him, personally
I really think in like 20 or 30 years we're gonna look back and say "huh he wasnt really that bad"
and he's basically untested with this kinda shit bc dems do play nice with each other, comparatively
not even necessarily to vote for Trump, but to fail to turn out for dems
my point is that Sanders has a lot of work to do to endear himself to voters outside of his dedicated base, and that a lot of his background could be weaponized against people who aren't necessarily inclined to like him or are already hesitant about his nomination
ppl will see what they want to see
i could see them working on ppl who aren't really thinking about it
here's the thing
no u
Hmmmm I dunno how well attacks like that would work if the other could just basically do a "no u"
i'm aware
I hope you realize that hypocrisy is kinda the name of the game here
also the part about campaign finances also is kinda applicable to trump isn't it
Fair enough
jarrett, that would require logical consistency that isn't frequently used in these kinds of campaigns
We can also note that he's up against a guy who hasnt exactly said a lot of favorable things about women
like I don't think he thinks rape is ok lmao
**this is not me saying I agree with the angle of making him look as bad as possible
but that's undeniably a very long time
and we can argue all night and day about whether he has changed
the essay was almost 50 yrs ago
ok here's the thing about the rape point that i want to point out
I've already said that I personally don't think his Cuba comments were that bad, but it's another "you need context and a lengthy explanation" situation and I can 100% see why people who literally fled that regime are upset
I also feel like he kinda shot himself in the foot w his recent Cuba comments. that's already opened up a new flood of socialist / communist / authoritarian sympathies attacks and effectively lost him the Cuban-American vote which is super important in Florida
this is all true btw doesn't even cover the actual lies and smears
the GOP already has tons of shit on Sanders
ok obviously y'all are welcome to disagree I'm not tryna tell you what to think but
And if we're talking shady past, Trump is probably shadier anyways
trump tends to be very reactionary
i'm aware of sanders having a shady political past, but trump digs more into more current fresh baggage imo
I dont put it past him to just say more and more dumb stuff
"Poor kids can be just as smart as white kids"
"I talked to a video game dev, a little creep that teaches people to kill"
i know he got a lot of shit w the line that included like "i'm running for senate" and "if you don't like me then vote for the other biden"
Biden's are mostly verbal mishaps and previous bad votes
and the recency is super fresh in ppl's minds
it's just that the early debate blunders really did not reflect well on him
strong disagree Bernie has a really shady past
but i could be wrong
i don't think bernie has less baggage but i think biden's is a lot more obvious and weaponizable
Dont think that happens in most timelines
Especially the fact that Bernie would have to drive the young voter turnout above what Obama did for the black vote
Interesting article
also, anyone who thinks Bernie has less baggage than Biden hasn't done their oppo research, and I say this as someone who held that view until a few weeks ago
for a while it seemed to be working pretty well, now it's more up in the air
another interesting vector to examine in the primary so far from a polisci pov is Bernie's strategy of doubling down and focusing on his loyal + existing voter base instead of outreach to other demographics, of staying a factional candidate instead of turning to more unifying rhetoric post-victory in NV
he's lost huge chunks of his 2016 support and lost states he previously won
Bernie has straight up failed to expand his coalition, unfortunately
and as of right now, Biden is winning the white working class
so like most previous elections I think it's gonna come down to indies and swing voters
i'm sorry
the dem party is just a mess ngl
he has not proven his ability to do that in literally any of the ~18 contests we have conclusive results for
Bernie's entire electability pitch has been about turnout. turning out new and young voters, like you said
with that said, of the dem candidates that are left, I genuinely think Biden has the best shot (especially with a good VP pick but I've said that a lot already)
and is still generally in much worse / less unified shape than the GOP
until very very recently, like the past 3 days lol, the dem party was pretty disorganized
the popular narrative among the left is that Trump is an idiot. this might be true might not but his campaign operation at least is FANTASTICALLY run
don't think it's clear that any of the candidates, including the ones who have now dropped, could beat him
I have been slightly cynical from the beginning about democrats' (in general) chances of winning v. Trump
I agree but also don't
anyways
this isn't conclusive but it's super interesting
https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/2/25/21152538/bernie-sanders-electability-president-moderates-data
I have an article for you!!
Biden is running on the fact that he's not Trump, which is the same thing that Hillary was running on
And the fact that he has a cause
I'm much more confident in Bernie's ability to beat Trump given his popularity among young people
So I think he can gather a large crowd relative to Biden
Meanwhile Trump appeals to all three
Biden doesnt really appeal to any of those people except maybe swing voters who happen to go blue
The challenge is either appealing to swing voters/new voters/people who don't vote
Especially when most people in the US dont vote and democratic/Republican is for the most part 50-50 with a few percent up or down
Biden has proven that he can win big *among democrats*
oh me neither lol
I'm still not confident that Biden can win the General election vs Trump
Eh I'll say it anyways
Was gonna say something about Biden but the conversation drifted
Ah
*patiently waiting for jarrett to finish typing*
I'm definitely interested in how her career will go lmao
no yeah for sure
i think she poses a very interesting "success" story
she's... interesting
rip
I find it hard to believe that AOC really believes some of the shit she says. she has an economics degree ffs, and spends a lot of time spreading patently false info. idk how much is just smoke and mirrors and virtue signaling and how much is genuine, but I think her already being the darling of the left is pretty dangerous
you don't succeed in politics without being self-serving
but no politician is a paragon of anything and it's probably unhealthy to idolize them that way
they're all very skilled politicians, don't get me wrong I do respect them
she honestly fucking pisses me off but that's a rant for another time lol. but in general it worries me that a lot of young progressives especially view people like AOC, Bernie, Omar, Tlaib as these paragons of virtue
and she gets a lot of momentum through just that
too social justicey sometimes
she feels kind of
i feel like she's gonna overshoot something and fuck her political career
i'm worried about AOC honestly
another point against untested technology and in favour of hand-marked paper ballots
also, a less obvious problem than iowa's clusterfuck, but yikes @ the 5-hour lines to vote in parts of cali and texas
definitely interested in how things will shift going forward. and also a little worried. ~~the day when AOC runs for pres is the day I probably start voting republican~~
"establishment" vs outsider
age is an obvious split but also race, especially latinos vs. african americans
idk from just like a nerdy pov the fault lines showing up in the dem party are fascinating
even cali is way closer than expected
that's fair
but he's finally proving he can actually win big
I was really harsh on him after NH bc I expected him to drop before SC
and am also way more enthusiastic about a possible biden nomination
obviously personally as a moderate/centrist I am pretty happy about this
still in shock that he won mass
biden really netted some hefty victories
just wow
I know!!!
the results of super tuesday
oh shit
supah tuesday for ya
L
also Biden is leading in Mass too which is crazy
's comment is actually kinda funny
Trump
I cannot lie
in mfking peace
be salty
let me
gdi
my laptop
the cam is now at the top
but just
i know
no they fixed that
nose cam
fucking
but the basic design is still the same
it now has lost the chin bezel and it's 16:10 rather than 16:9
this is the 2015 model
Then did the laptop get shorter front to back?
they finally made all the bezels symmetrical
I can’t really tell the difference from how they currently look
it used to have a one-inch chin at the bottom of the screen
I'm still just waiting for them to do a full redesign
Have the bezels gotten even smaller?
the bezel game was why I bought my XPS 15 in the first place
XPS 13 2020 looking BIG SEXY
rip
I take back what i said about Klob she made a smart move
ooooh first major upset Biden projected to take Minnesota
My only hot take on tonight is that I think Bloomberg is gonna severely underperform his polling
deys is prolly gon die
Y i k e s
Yeah
n g l
and bernie's health ain't the best
And they're fuckin old
prob death
They're travelling sm and touching so many people
Y'all........ Question that exploded my brain courtesy of Clare Malone (one of my fave politics reporters).... What if Bernie or Biden gets the coronavirus??
Oof
Coursehero
They put them up on chegg I think
how would they lock them behind a paywall if he still has the originals
now I get it
oh
?
Apparently someone stole his and ramyas study guides and tried to lock them behind a paywall
entire history of <#503805570860580884> , as of 3/3/2020
backup complete!
starting backup...
!backup
oh absolutely
are people still using his stuff at skyline\?
This is super interesting, btw
https://youtu.be/16S2lQn5xgs
so it is hard to say
the thing about Bernie though is that his ground game is fantastic
I've heard a lot of berners say he should pick Nina Turner; I genuinely cannot think of a worse running mate for him
the socialist label is gonna kill him in the general. and I may get proven wrong if he wins the nom but he seems much more likely to pick a dumb VP (fewer obvious choices, lack of propensity to compromise)
I agree that he's got a LOT of baggage but I honestly think Bernie's worse off
I think Biden could win if he's smart about his vp pick
he's stumbled really hard and i feel like it just gives trump so much ammunition to work w
i really think biden wouldn't do super well against trump
oh boi
she could've at least stayed to block Bernie in MN
honestly, I am very upset that Amy is dropping before tomorrow lmao
SO. BREAKING: both Pete and Amy are endorsing Biden
i retract my statement
althoguh with what you've told me about your sleeping patterns
probably
cause your body like *sis what the fuck*
no
hmm
a bit
is it bad that I already wanna sleep again
damn
wait really?
and if you want a starting point, this day one year ago, UW decisions started coming out
so I guess while it's nice to always be looking for the next step forward, it's good sometimes to take a glance back at all the progress you've made so far
which can be hard especially now that I'm surrounded by geniuses on a daily basis
the constant cycle of self-improvement really starts to take a toll on you if you don't step back and remember that you really are somebody worth something
I guess my situation is I'm learning how to treat myself more kindly
> kind of like examining myself from an external pov has been a big driver for personal improvement for me I think
infj approved message
Gotta make the most of the college experience I guess
Ah well
yeah that kinda sucks
oof
Which, good for them but not my vibe
At this point I kind of wish I could find other chill premeds but some of them are like hella cracked out competitive
I just try to be p chill bout it all and I get their attitudes but they’re not my fave perspectives to say the least
It’s been a weird place
So yeah
And I get the sense that Gene feels like talking about success in the group makes other people feel bad
As much as Jane is great and all, I don’t study w her bc she tells me that me being ahead of her makes her feel insecure which is like okay I get it but there’ll never be a place where there isn’t someone who can crack the problem faster than you
I do wish I knew more people like me because the people I am around are very touchy about people doing better than them
the answer is yes, btw, even though I have a lot of baggage I wish I had more friends like myself, I only really have one. (it gets tiring to always be the person dragging other people outside, even though I really enjoy it)
kind of like examining myself from an external pov has been a big driver for personal improvement for me I think
I'm p sure alan and I have talked about it before
I think a lot about whether I'd want to be friends w myself
really?
rip?
These thoughts have never run through my brain
idk how else to describe it other than i just want to be a good person
by default i'm not a people pleaser, but i just want to be someone that makes others happy
i know i've mentioned this to noah but i'm stronger for others than for myself
Omg same
i don't think i'm an unpleasant person to be around but i've realized that some people think i'm obsessed w how ppl view me when in reality i just wonder if i've made them unhappy bc i want to make others happy
hm this is a really late thought bc i was asleep when you had yalls convo about rating how much you'd want to be around yourself, i'd give myself like a +4
Glad to see you slept 12 hours
I am: dead
lmao its 2:30 for you
Morning I'm so tired fuck
that actually sounds kinda fun
sigh
we need a good morning/night channel just so we can see the stupid times all of us get up and go to sleep at
Morning
good morning
good night
*submit to the will of Kthrax'nar*
Good night ily
GOOD NIGHT
*let the void take you*
Ok
I concede
*give in*
me too
just
No I'm like about to pass out fr
get some sleep
I slept like an hour on the bus
lady
Shhhhh
(Cindy you're on your 21st hour awake as of now)
hEY
for Cindy it might be the wild child in her that makes her so fun to go out with, but makes her have a terrible sleep schedule
so a fault may have an opposite boon to a personality, both of which are governed by a single trait that the person operates with
so I think it's better to instead try to frame the idea of faults as part of a larger influence of a greater, overall aspect of one's personality
it's great for me because then I get to worry about the details myself
hence, toe shoes for hiking
he's not worried about the details so long as he has a good time
huh?
for Fran, it's the same thing that makes him eat french toast with his hands that makes him such a great person to be around
the reason? I think too much.
for me, it's the same reason I can take so many carefully planned steps to make someone's experience the best it can be that I'm also hyper critical about myself and even those around me
sometimes it's a side effect of our nature
something I've come to understand about human nature is that, sometimes, faults aren't necessarily faults
of some of my faults
i can confidently say im aware
we're all still figuring our shit out it's fine
if you're aware and trying it's better than if not
consistently then
you *know*
I don't think anyone *constantly* fails to improve
so you konw
🤡
I dunno Fran, I'm in there pretty often when we play Smash
in all fairness i hardly do either
I do not
you dont know my head
awwwww I don't think that's true
pity is the word that it boils down to
whatever your answer this is the kinda motherfucker i deal with on a daily basis
lol
infj
ANGRY
how does this person make you feel?
have you ever met someone who knows what they do wrong but constantly fail to make strides to improve?
I am the cause of 70% of my problems
I generally like myself except when I don't
but at least it's funny when we are
I think I'd rate myself a +7
but god we're a fuckin idiot sometimes
which is why I can give myself +10 to myself because I like being me and I would immediately suffer if I was anyone else
also fair
it's really up to the person to decide what their scale means to them
that's fair
> I cannot fathom being trapped with someone else literally forever
this could apply to that, read: commitment issues coming through! but no in a relationship I would still want them to leave me alone a good chunk of the time
but i feel like thats teh way of things
not that i would know from personal expereince
dont most life partners still rate a 8 or 9 though
I know what you mean lol
IwastalkingaboutfindingsomeonewhoIgenuinelywanttospendtherestofmylifeakamarrybutkeepgoing
I cannot fathom being trapped with someone else literally forever
> well I mean, at least so far
no like I may be kinda extraverted but I need my damn alone time
I'd really rather not be anyone else lol
I'd rate myself a +10 with perspective to myself
trust me there's been plenty of times where I wished I didn't have to tolerate my stupid ass
i think i'd rate myself a +5 tbh
well I mean, at least so far
even yourself?
bc if that's the case +10 is impossible for anyone to achieve lmao
if -10 is never want to be around them would +10 be always want to be around them
and with that eventually comes forgetting
because if I have some sort of control over it, I take measures to avoid people at all costs
when it comes to people who can theoretically reach a -10 my mind just tends to forget about them
I feel like you'd have to do something really fucked up to get to a -10 and I guess I don't personally know that many legitimately terrible people
so yes
ok I've witnessed that
:))))))))))))))
**cough**
so like me when Fran decides to start eating french toast with his hands
like I could deal w him if absolutely necessary but I would be fighting the urge to escape out a window the whole time
daniel's probably like a -8 for me
the Chef from Plateau Club is a solid -9
so it's not really fair to judge him against someone like daniel
(and that's a good thing let's be clear)
yeah in hindsight his behavior goes deeper than just personality issues
david hildebrand is a good one though idk if I can say I personally know him anymore
look if neither of those names ring any bells in your head I don't think I can start to explain them at 1:44 AM
who n who?
david hildebrand and jimmy from early skyline come to mind
*that I personally know
I'm trying to think of someone who would be a -10 for me
lol
-1: wore a shirt I own and made me stop wearing it
with a reputation history of
daniel song currently has a -1
look on my reputation scale where 0 is neutral, -10 is never wanting to be around you ever and +10 being die hard friends
I assume the original question was brought up bc jarrett saw helen yin's post about how he was trying to meet up w her
I never accepted any of his requests on any social media (and then fucked off to canada)
thankfully I think he did eventually get the memo that I did not want to talk to him
I'm p sure the only game at least he has room for at all is league
mmm i dont think he'd go there
would he be the type of person to say "oh you play smash? I bet I could beat you" if I mentioned I played smash
it was a bit of a yikes I got really good at just leaving him somewhere
like deca stuff, and a spanish field trip, etc
hm :/
> I couldn't tell if he was into me like romantically or just really wanted to be my friend
the reason for this was because he would find me and basically stalk me at every school trip and it really legitimately freaked me out
well to be fair he caught wind that the other cindy and i played
league whenever you weren't talking about class material
naturally
no room? cause thats an exaggeration
dont believe me on what part
I'm not entirely sure I believe you (and that doesn't match up to my experiences) but that is strangely reassuring bc jarrett's question brought back a tidal wave of memories better left repressed
yes or yes
it was league
if you werent talking to him about class material
day
all
he was league
i dont think he had space in his mind for romance
not winning points on my end either, despite never talking to me ever
so uh
I couldn't tell if he was into me like romantically or just really wanted to be my friend
only memory I have of him is that I own the shirt he's wearing in his insta pfp and I immediately wanted to stop wearing said shirt
but honestly I did not have the energy to deal w that
I also feel kinda guilty about being part of everyone ostracizing him basically
never talked to the guy once
I stand corrected
ohhh him
kind of a small pic but I am not about to follow him for more no siree
fire alarm buddiess
lmfaoooo
oh god oh fuck I smell weed our fire alarm's gonna go off any minute now
although iirc he didnt submit a picture for the yearbook
on it boss
yearbook, anything
does ANYONE have a picture
alright this kinda frustrates me
and that's the end of the daniel saga
just saw, no speak
then senior year all i saw of him was in the hallways maybe 5-10 times
🙃
i somewhat often had him on group projects in bdvdb
since i always stick to small selections of friends
(this was why a lot of people hated him)
he would literally just ramble until maners cut him off
we had him in bdvdb
but apart from that he was okay
oh my god I had tok with him you are describing this very accurately
but he just droned on and you couldnt ignore him cause he's *so damn loud*
perhaps sometimes somewhat off topic
what he talked about often was okay
as far as i remember
and often wasnt sure when to stop
and loudly
what annoyed me most about him was that he talked a lot
and you cindy
salina's right about personal boundaries with him
so yeah that was a pretty negative first impression lmao but like. obvious example of the boundaries / lack of awareness issue that defines daniel song in any given social situation
you don't fuck w my food!!!!! hoe ass
s m h
he takes BOTH HANDS and scoops out the biggest damn handfuls he can possibly fit, the sneaky lil glutton
I hold out the bag
he goes "ooooh I love those! can I have some?" and at this point I barely know him so I'm like sure I guess
one time early in the school year I brought in a ziploc bag of shrimp chips
daniel song is adjacent to helen 1 (and frequently inserts himself into random conversations)
so helen helen salina and I always sat together in deca it was a fun time
ok kinda funny story like even at the time I knew it was objectively fucking hilarious but was also kinda pissed about it
^^^
i just don't want to deal w him really
i just feel like daniel song has a lot of issues w personal boundaries but i don't really hate him
rip
need to exterminate
brb
oh my fuck there's a huge ass bug on my wall!!!!
anyways anyways I do not hate daniel song and I don't use the word "hate" lightly, idk if there's any individual I would apply that feeling to
multiple last names = split person disorder
wen zhang righi rubiolo each have 1 person
team wang = me and gene team li = helen and jane
he's just ordering people who he likes / are generally well-liked by last name
lol
oh and teams Wong and Cascante are also at 0.5-0
would you mind uh explaining this?
but have a strong alliance going into the next half
teams Chang and Lam are both a 0.5-0
teams Wen, Zhang, Righi, and Rubiolo at 1-0
how is this score even being counted
uh rip?
meanwhile teams Wang and Li are both at 2-0 in their favors
oof!
either way the score is 0-2 for Team Daniel in the popularity game
I remember Cheng also being annoying for very different reasons but I have not interacted with him since early middle school I believe so
don't remember who Song is
ok yeah that's what I thought
I'm talking about Cheng
wait I think I do remember
I basically never saw him do any work in any class and I shared an unfortunate number with him
but I couldn't help but be pretty creeped out by him on several occasions bc he'd literally just. find me and follow me around
lol
yeah that's the problem I don't know which is which
(not cheng if that's who you're thinking of)
daniel song
anyways, I do legitimately feel bad for him bc I'm 98% sure he's undiagnosed somewhere on the autism spectrum
I'm not sure if we're talking about the same person lol
idk I haven't been on facebook for ages but I think someone mentioned a long post from him about reapplying
i thought he wasn't in college rn?
he strikes me as the kind of guy who wanted to go to CalTech/MIT/Carnegie but got rejected because he can't write an essay worth a damn so he came to UW instead with a snobby attitude to heal his fragile ego
coding competition
and ok that's the first time I've heard of any proof of any actual smarts from him tbh
what's icpc?
had a god complex throughout the entire thing
he placed top 3 at the ICPC competition
insufferable genius archetype
remember when a long while back I explained that I don't hate Jeffrey, but have a general distaste for him? yeah multiply that by a revulsion factor of 100 and throw in some genuine pity and you've got how I feel about Daniel
Why do y'all hate Daniel Song so much?
Lol
what the fuck lmao
just learn chinese
but it's in Chinese
I find an answer
I google an error I'm having

yeah baking is way messier usually
that's what i've found
baking is a lot of washing the dishes
baking is weirdly way more and way less effort than cooking
ill just eat cake all the time
but learning to *bake* sounds goddamn lit
cause i dont think im all that interested in learning to *cook*
ifeel likee that'll get me once i move out
haha cooking
in some ways I feel less independent i.e. I'm not cooking everyday anymore
I also didn't really consider the independence part in my answer but mostly bc I don't think it's changed me much as a person lol it just took a huge weight off my shoulders as far as not having to hide shit from my parents anymore
tl;dr i am a bad person
but also i wanted the internship to pay for my laptop and my nursing assistant program
which i considered
i.e. i got my internship last year by bluffing that i was going into business
don't lie lie, but bending the truth is really useful
also being a decent liar and problem solver will save you a lot of the time
^^
job searches are very anxiety inducing, but a lot of the time being a competent human being will get you quite far
to be honest
it's up to you when you want to leave, but whenever that happens you got this fran!
lots of times we don't feel "ready" for big change, doesn't mean you actually aren't
i didnt really consider the independence aspect for answering the question myself
long story short i'm looking forward to moving out some day. i love my mother with all my heart but i find i much more enjoy my time at school with people and studying than my time at home, even if at home im playing stuff like hollow knight and get the best food in the fucking world. i'd say it largely came from the time in japan with those goombas but also just from experiencing college and trying to reflect on what i like and dont like in my life. am i truly ready to move out? fuck if i know man despite having a job for two years running the thought of finding another one terrifies me but i think once i get over that hurdle ill feel fine

"You made me smile while sitting on the floor leaning against the toilet"
also true, though I've never thought about it that way
aw that's super wholesome
but he said something about how i have a cute cat-like smile when i'm trying not to laugh
noah said this last year and idk if he even remembers this
forgot about it
oh the compliments question
only salina and maybe noah will get the weird context but mine is "you're like an underwater goddess" from austin freeman at a jsa pool party. lmfao
oh also the reason I asked the compliments question is bc the single compliment that has stuck in my head the most for YEARS came from a really weird source and was super trivial, yet I remember the moment so clearly
something I didn't mention and that's maybe weird to bring up but has been an important change is that I'm much more comfortable w my sexuality now. you know I'm still not 100% sure on where I stand and recently had a mild crisis about it lol but if I was to pick the most impactful experience from the past year that wasn't graduating or starting college it'd probably be first pride I went to (mostly) out of the closet
- better social life -- throughout most of high school i put socializing on a back burner so i only had the same conversations with the same few people most of the time. After getting to know you guys more, and also making a lot of different friends at college i've gotten to understand people better and figure out how to navigate relationships, including the more messy and dramatic side. I think this has made me a more mature and realistic person to some extent. I'd say that I've learned more about handling a large quantity rather than quality of relationships, through general quality has also improved. 

- independence, similar to Alan's point. I've always felt confident that I would be fine living on my own, even though I had no experience to back it up. Now actually living for myself has taught me more about time management (even though that's not perfect) and learning to handle a large number of miscellaneous tasks in daily life. Even though I still don't need to cook frequently or wash my own bathroom I feel like it will be easier for me to incorporate new types of tasks as they are needed. So generally independence has given me more confidence since I don't have to think about "what-ifs".
i'll also write something
wow that is quite a detailed analysis
Smash Bros: I could kick my own ass from end of senior year
Weebery: Definitely leveled up since going to Japan, but also cooled off a little (whether as a result of running out of shows, time, or dedication)
Programming: Java sucks -> Java sucks but it's okay we love it anyways
... more as I think of them on the way
Physical, mental, and emotional strength: Between going to the gym 3-5 times a week for a half an academic year now, finding out that my best performance comes at the delicate balance of chill and grind, and learning to recognize, address, and respond to my emotional states when they come up, I've developed a better understanding of myself through and through

Independence: Living on my own, completely independent of any support other than myself, actually sounds like a reasonable endeavor now. I have a better understanding of what a real "daily life" looks like to an adult, and I can foresee a future where every action I take was influenced by nothing other than my previous decisions and every effect of that choice will only influence my future self.

Relationship Complexity: My closest friends have never been closer, nor had a better understanding of who I am from both inside and outside. They can not only understand my quirks, habits, patterns, and interactions, but understand how they came to be and even explain my behavior in certain ways. Although, to varying degrees of accuracy. I've also never had this many good friends that I genuinely want to keep beyond just the scales of high school and college, and that best relationships I have with people are the ones that are the most unique and complex ones. Quite literally, I couldn't replace them with anyone else.
oh dear god how do I even start to answer this question
wow. super detailed and I'm super happy for + proud of you, especially on the medical work front
anyway: serious answer about how much i've changed... not super different? mostly just rounding down some jagged edges
-getting my ass kicked my college admissions: for a long time, i was angry; mostly at myself, but partly because it caused tensions with my family to really come to the forefront. i think it was a good learning moment in a lot of different ways. it made me reconsider the way i was doing work and what i wanted to do in the future.
-doing more medical work kind of things: honestly just reaffirmed why i felt drawn to the medical field; i definitely feel more certain about it now. i've been thrown in the deep end in a lot of different ways and i feel like i could handle the work well. it's hard and fast-paced, but i wouldn't trade it for anything. it honestly makes me really happy to be able to help others and find solutions and answers to what major issues might be. 
-i think i've learned a lot about how much emotional drama i want to deal with in the past year or so... the answer has turned out to be not a whole ton. i've been a lot more neutral with a lot of bs that's gone down, which i don't think would have in the past. i've worked hard on being more patient and reasonable and being supportive in a way that actually helps others. 
-i've realized how much i value sincerity and openness, but it's not always realistic to expect that of people 
-i've started focusing more on stepping away from problems that i know can't be handled well in the moment because pretending that a resolution can be reached often just makes the problem worse
-i think i've also gotten more used to getting my ass handed to me in diff ways... cough school cough league cough cough cough
i didn't know what that meant at the time
one compliment i remember most was at a tech summer camp in eighth grade someone told me i was "very well-rounded"
I'm serious btw that was not a pity thing
oh
what spot
Cindy just took spot number 4
*shrug*
i just
and its not that i dont get complimented i think
in one ear, out the other
im exaggerating a bit
rip compliments huh
also damn fran
good lord
lmao
if maybe if you'd asked me out in hs, i might've given you a chance
and i think i followed that up w/ like
ever
i dont remember compliments
i said that like at the beginning of the quarter
jarrett you're cute
dear god jarrett
how ive changed? ive been a lot better at staying focused on school/priorities in general and very quickly started preferring spending time with friends than playing vidya games all day.
d a m n
Tied for second place is someone saying my fingernails were really nice and Salina saying "well objectively speaking you're not totally terrible looking"
Best compliment I've ever received was when someone said to me and the small group I was in "you know Jett doesn't talk that much but when he does, he's really funny"
I feel like I really haven't changed in the slightest except that i probably wont put up with other people's crap as much as I used to
3 things
-I'm still interested in hearing everyone else's responses to the how have you changed question
-another question: what's the best / your favorite / most memorable compliment you've received?
-on a completely different note a new perspective of mine since it's become increasingly likely is that I kinda want bernie to win the nomination just because bernie v. trump would be a thing to behold... it'd just be so interesting politically!
not even through anything he intentionally did but just I feel like I'm less judgmental now about people who are highly emotional / sensitive
<@!472541429130854421> I already mentioned this to you and he's not even here anymore lol but I think being friends w gene genuinely made me a better person
I think I've gotten better at empathizing with people who are very different from me
so nothing too dramatic, the core of my bitchass personality is very much intact. I certainly hope there's been some growth and maturity though
it's hard to say bc I don't Feel like I've changed much
hmm
well
> How different of a person do you think you’ve become since the beginning of senior year?
not very, tbh
what is it a test on?
it's "honor" frat
But yeah
We have a test before induction
Lol you guys have tests?
I’m at my frat exam rn so in a bit
Hmm
If you want to give a serious answer then sure
Um did you want a more serious answer
Jkjk
I think things have changed on this end
I now have a sugar daddy
Well
How different of a person do you think you’ve become since the beginning of senior year?

south carolina (the last early state) votes on saturday
or at least people will finally start dropping out
highly likely that we'll know who the nominee will be after
almost 2000 delegates up for grabs
first Big wave of voting for the dem primary including some of the most important states (cali, texas)
what is that
that's kinda crazy
we're a week from super tuesday
he's like dumbledore after getting a haircut for the first time in 10 years
ok that's kind of fair
uh
~~I can see him in a robe~~
~~he also has the looks~~
~~the only way he's gonna pass his policies is by magic~~
I was also thinking that bernie needs to be a wizard or mage of some sorts
Klobuchar omitted as i dont know enough about her
lmaooo
Warren: Rogue
Biden: Bard
Sanders: Wizard
Buttigieg: Fighter
Bloomberg: Final Boss
Biden feels tanky
oh that's fun give all the remaining candidates an rpg class
Give her a dagger
Warren is clearly a Rogue
I disagree
every time she gets an opportunity to attack Bloomy on stage man it's like she can barely contain her glee
I am not a big warren fan but I would love to see her decapitate some bitches
so I am not the only one who feels this way
I also just found this
"if you don't like me vote for the other biden"
"i am running for the senate"
but maybe that's just bc he has Bloomberg to draw contrasts with now, who is a distinctly icky and unwelcome presence on stage lmao
Biden came across as actually likable for once, good job to him on that one
he got genuinely angry at a few points and I was kinda with him on that one, though he has made way more legitimately problematic comments about other communist/socialist countries like the soviet union lol
The Hitler drank water argument
Ah yes
the world is not black and white is what I'm trying to get across and it's frustrating that the moderators kept trying to push Bernie's praise of very specific aspects of the regime (while also disavowing authoritarianism!) as super problematic
and it's also true that while Castro murdered a lot of people and caused a lot of Cubans to flee to the US, he improved healthcare and literacy rates in his country by a ton
obviously from the US perspective (and mine) authoritarianism / totalitarianism bad but anyone who takes a history class will learn the objective facts that the US arranged or supported various coups across Latin America and the Middle East especially
I will say I kinda sympathize with sanders on the cuba stuff I don't think it should be taboo to mention that the US has overthrown a bunch of governments or that dictatorial regimes can do good in some aspects
buttigieg and biden especially get a lot of hate
the average twitterite is also pretty young so I guess it's not that surprising
then there's the cesspit that's trump's mentions and comments where a lot of very right-wing people live
lots of warren and sanders people
well it's not just that like if you check out any trending tags or read comments the average twitterite is very left-wing
Is political twitter biased if you only follow verified people?
I think he did pretty well in a particularly messy / disjointed debate with everyone attacking him but if there is a winner here it's probably Biden, who had one of his strongest performances this entire campaign
also everyone claiming Bernie won that debate 🤔
the number of people complaining that the SC audience was "full of billionaires" is exhausting, there's like a couple hundred max in the entire US and like half are in either NY or Cali
political twitter is a cool way to keep up w journalists, reactions, and immediate breaking news but is very very biased
yikes
if i opened my twitter (which i haven't in a year) it would probably be all BTS fan posts
and I appreciate his commentary lmao
speaking of yang I miss him
I respect that energy
obviously she is old and female but unlike the others she seems like she would take genuine pleasure in eviscerating her enemies
no
what?
funny enough my bets in this scenario are on elizabeth warren
only if spectators are free to join the pit for the title of president of the united states
good chance of winning
yang should have stuck around then
what if we just gave all the primary candidates swords and had them gladiate to the death
It actually made me laugh ngl
🙂
politics
ew
My Twitter feed: politics politics OkCupid ad disguised as politics politics
maybe it's not used as often in super cold temps idk
much smarter people than me decided on that
but idk
also the part that concerns me is that A36 is a structural building steel
that's so satisfying, btw
oh true I wasn't accounting for the mini peak at 0
so for A36 you've lost 50%, and for 2024-T4 you've gained 50% just at freezing
lol
ignore the F
converted
feel like it's rare that I'll be climbing in -60 F temp lol but cool
yea
the first one is aluminum yea?
it annoys me too
cause that's what we did it in
why is your temperature in fahrenheit honestly triggered
while the aluminum gets stronger as it gets colder
the two steels get weaker as it gets colder, especially pay attention to the sharp drop off a A36 at below freezing
this is impact strength vs temperature test we did two weeks ago
it's like p much the same temp here as seattle lmao
wdym
actually for temperature you can experience this cause you're in Canada
in realty you have, surface finish, alloying elements, stress risers, shot peening, crack propagation, corrosion, temperature, internal stresses, etc...
so yeah that's super interesting
typically with regular use you wanna switch out your carabiners every ~3 years at most
I could go on and on about how this isn't even the whole picture, this is just for a "perfect" test sample
aluminum doesn't have this limit, it will always fail after a certain number of cycles regardless of stress
except below a certain threshold steel can theoretically go an infinite number of cycles
the more you stress it the less cycles you get
basically cycles vs stress
a steel one could *technically* be designed to never need to be replaced
basically it means this
`aluminum has no endurance limit` lol well I didn't know this specifically
but I can figure that out because it's aluminum and aluminum has no endurance limit
I didn't know that specifically
that you need to replace carabiners relatively often
knew which part?
I'm surprised you knew that
an example of maintenance is, carabiner are generally aluminum, and aluminum has no endurance limit, it will fail after a certain number of cycles no matter low little load you put on it
I mean you could free solo but that's even sketchier lmaooo
if they fuck up while belaying you're gonna go splat
also reliance on your partner in a lot of cases
yea that's probably up there in terms of death rate, high falls, reliance on your own equipment maintenance and use, and remote locations
if you're asking for elaboration, rock climbing accidents are fairly common, someone fell to their death in yosemite the day after my sister climbed the same route, I also have a friend who broke his leg last year. idk if I'm gonna be as gung ho about it as my sis but it is definitely a hobby I really enjoy and want to do a lot more of
for emphasis, how are you not used to this by now
`Generally Dangerous Hobbies`
caps?
I just almost went to my russian class an hour early
TIL
cool
this is techincally true
to end my rant
I've probably thought about how I'm gonna die more than I should lmao
in most cases it's just a proxy for old age though so if I'm like 80 when it hits I guess I'll just hope euthanasia's legal by then
anyways the 3rd most likely thing to get me after Generally Dangerous Hobbies and car crash is probably cancer so I've got that to look forward to
but techincally these are the same
despite looking the same, one was completely redone of the ground up
idc if it's technically "the same"
that doesn't count
oh yea and these are the same too
and also other weird stuff like these are the same car
the rest of the car is p nice
they're weird
I don't like the eyes
so this is also "a bug"
and techincally a Porsche 911 is also just a bug
despite a ~60 year gap
but this is also
because this is a bug
you have to only do it for the current version or it just doesn't make any sense
Ok that’s fair
but ~2012 - 2014
depends on when the car was last redone from scratch
And how long has the current version existed
no one has ever died in the current version of the car
What do you mean by no death
yep
I assume
no-death vehicles you can buy
What the fuck is this
"Audi A6 Quattro, Audi Q7 Quattro, rear-wheel drive BMW 535i, BMW 535xi xDrive, Jeep Cherokee 4x4, Lexus CT 200h, front-wheel Lexus RX 350, front-wheel drive Mazda CX-9, Mercedes-Benz M-Class 4Matic, Toyota Tacoma Double Cab Long Bed 4x4, and front-wheel Volkswagen Tiguan"
I’ll even more likely to die a boring death
esp since I've had a ridiculous number of close calls
I would like to go out in a blaze of glory doing something cool or live to be old enough to kill myself, but my hunch has always been that it'll be something mundane like a car crash
Same applies to me tbh
What a romantic story
Live and die by the 20 year old Toyota sedan
maybe that changes things idk
interesting though
there are currently zero death vehicles you can buy
heh
so if you're gonna die in a car crash it's gonna be soon in your current car Cindy
we will all be driving relatively modern cars which in terms of safety are truly incredible
Why our group specifically?
I think that's very unlikely for anyone in our group
We’ll likely have a lot more advanced car tech
really?
my answer's the same probably a car accident
Probably
> have you ever thought about how you'll die
didn't we just talk about this like last week
Rip
*digital personality available in robot form
alzheimer's at age 130
what if our causes of death all just became "coronavirus at age 73"
have you ever thought about how you'll die
it mutates fast like flu
aww
the problem is you don't gain permanent immunity to it
lol
like chickenpox
now I'm imagining moms organizing group playdates for kids to get them exposed to coronavirus
nice
so we'll probably all get coronavirus someday 😄
regarding coronavirus, lots of epidemiologists think it cannot be contained and it will become a seasonal illness like the cold or flu
Oof
big kek
Kek my family’s Europe trip might also be cancelled due to coronavirus 😅
and te answer is ere before us
te question was could starbot exist

starbot never sould have existed
if we played by the weter we sould wit starbot, e would not exist
i can't tell if that's missing any letters

i.e the stupid way to spell Noah

idk I mean it's closer to heysoos you are correct but hey-zeus looks cooler
No
He *sus*
what kind of back alley crack is your alphabet smoking

where did the z sound come from
well, hey-zeus is the superior jesus, so I approve
I use swipe to type and have the keyboard in English Spanish French and German so it just does what it wants <@503787499605458954>

but he's also quite socially awkward in new groups
idk something that I've realized kinda recently is that jarrett is very nonconfrontational

like a 2
Hope do we rate Jarrett? I say 2 cause his tone of voice is a little off putting but once you talk to him you realize he gives no shots about anything
heysoos
I appreciate that you added the accent so that it's hey-zeus and not gee-sus
and keep my hands clean
fran's right I could organize a hit
interesting
I did it was fine
huh usually that one gets embedded

<@!470822754262712329> stop, get some help
V I B E
no. stop.
man being vibe checked by your coworkers lol
hehe
co workers
the hitman part
damn fran
no. stop.
I've been told I have good vibes from several coworkers
> your neutral face is kinda neutral
why isn't there a neutral emoji that I can use to react to this
I feel like fran's neutral face is kinda cheery / I just get extremely nonthreatening vibes from him, which is why I rated him low, but p much everyone else here is 5+ imo
Not that I think you'd get to that point but
Also due o seeing you as a secretary I feel like you could organize a good hit on somebody if they crossed deep into your bad side and you felt the need to
your neutral face is neutral
if in a complete-strangers situation
for me it's more like I'm not more likely to approach you than someone else?
So yeah compilation error
That was supposed to be even if
lol
`compilation error: if if`
And when you get angry you get serious
yeah I don't get that vibe
You just kinda have that vibe to me
If if you're not super authoritarian
oh interesting fran
Give an impression of authority to me
imo
I gave you a neutral score
are an ass sometimes
Uhh
You kinda like
esp. since Fran of all people gave me a 6
I want the reasons behind my above average score on this
rip?
or in my small case "scale of 1 - 10 how fucked am I"
I'm more thinking about "intimidating" in terms of like "if you were a complete stranger how likely would I be to approach you on first impressions alone"
it comes to mind when asking the question of "how dangerous is this person" and "how hard would it be to neutralize them if something goes wrong"
I only think about it if they're obviously threatening, if they look like I could break them, or if someone brings it up
explicame por favor
I've met very few intimidating people in my life, Sam from the YMCA, Jenny my Muay Thai instructor, Nicholas when woken up, random absolutely massive people at the gym
` kung fu sword spinning ass`
what
no I'm not messing with your six foot kung fu sword spinning ass
To fight me that is
the "could I drop ____ in a fight" thing is rarely a factor for me
You don't know that 😉 you should try
but if he's ever in a fight he's likely on my side
could I drop Fran in a fight? very obviously not.
lmao cindy i was about to bring up the toe shoes
I think we're all working with very different ideas of what "intimidating" is
Good demeanor but if you don't see all the way through the sarcasm it's a lil scare
fran gets a 2 from me bc I am slightly scared of anyone who wears toe shoes all the time
fran gets a 1 from me because nobody looks at fran and thinks "oh the guy with the Walkin' Buds t shirt really puts me on edge"
Salina has a total Don f w me air
i don't got time for bullllllllllshiet
but I think she also has a don't fuck w me vibe
yeah in other contexts salina's a huge fuckin softie
Fran, you just exude happiness
look put me around an animal and i'm like a solid 2
I think fran is probably the most approachable
Thanks
also i love your dog and you've seen me gush over him
I think I'm a solid 3. I was bouta say 2 but then I realized I'm 6 foot
a lot of the deciding factor is if you 1) look like you'd get angry easily and 2) how effectively I could drop you in a fight
you're just fuckin biased mate
see noah
I'm not one
girls, idk
more like 3
maybe
well to guys 4
you fuck off
fuck off
i'm dating you
noah
4
no
i feel like i'm ~7-8
although factors such as time of day, proximity to other people, location, and gender of the person rating have a rather large impact
you're not intimidating but you're also not the most approachable
you smol too
I give myself a average of 2 - 3
small
I'll have you know I am. ABOVE AVERAGE HEIGHT
yep
lmao
WOW
you're just kinda small sorry
going from class to class I'm usually just like laughing w friends though so
welllll it also depends bc I feel like I have a very don't fuck w me attitude when I'm in a rush
oh like 3 lmao
going from class to class context
walking around campus context
2 sometimes 8 sometimes
and the context
me? depends a lot on the person
what do you think about yourself
lol
I gave a kinda cop-out answer
*cindy used struggle*
cindy get on the damn train lol
uhhhh
I'm not sure
we can use reactions to keep tally
actually
for you
6
oh interesting

Oh p much the worst casual thing you can do to get on my bad side is being rude to wait staff

poor manners

unnatural hair coloring
<@340319804747415553>
thot knots
you shut up
Shut up
camo pants
There's definitely more but I'm having a hard time thinking of my pet peeves for some reason
> What is something else that gives you a negative first impression of someone?
-speaking unnecessarily loud on the phone in public spaces i.e. transit
-bad driving
-being into hard drugs
-???
Apologies for disappearing
initial thoughts matter
yeah but
which is something <@!173668455856340994> needs to learn about camo pants
thus is the downfall of appearances: they don't always reflect character to the best degree
that is, without actually getting to know them
no way of knowing for sure
do they have no hair because of neo nazism, chemotherapy, or just because they prefer it that way?
balding, for instance
but obesity, from my perspective, can be viewed as another irregularity with a person that may or may not be their fault
Ms. Boas at Skyline is a very large person with an even larger heart
this is not to imply that all obese people are terrible people though, some truly are struggling with it as part of their identity and appearance and are fighting against it with all they can
As long as you’re aware of it and don’t act against those people you’re fine
Everyone has biases against certain groups of people
And Noah may be right that appearance matters more to me than most idk
I mean I guess but I do feel bad lol
abuse, disorders, conditions, you name it
that likely either needs fixing or treatment in more than just physical means
usually when someone reaches the level of obesity you're describing, something is in extreme discourse in their lifestyle or personality
sarcasm aside, yes I'd say that's a normal response
without hurting anyone's feelings?
how can I say the phrase "that sounds so unreasonably mundane that it kinda bores me"
What is something else that gives you a negative first impression of someone?
hmm
And I'm not saying it's like I dislike the person forever just my initial impression is usually negative
Which is a yikes
I feel like it's specifically people who are noticeably and extremely overweight
i.e. is it only fat people you have this inclination towards, or people with abnormalities in general?
but an inclination to dislike obese people simply because they are obese might need more unpacking
I'd say that's normal
a negative reaction to what is by all means a very obvious and prominent health issue?
It flip flops a lot
I've been more open about my body image issues recently
I frequently think I'm too fat despite being borderline underweight
To answer Helen's question, I'm not sure
I won't treat you different if you're ugly but I absolutely will if you're hot
Though I think everyone has a level of unintentional bias
Maybe that's shitty idk
It doesn't matter in my assessment of their character but it definitely matters on first impressions / affects how I approach them
Anyways I'm not offended bc what you said was true, though I only really comment (both internally and externally) on people I find attractive, don't generally notice when they aren't to me
well that's a fun phrasing
that phrasing cracks me up
.... uh
What is a level of fatness that you would be afraid to become
I know it's not healthy and have been trying to stop obsessing for a few years
No yeah I'm extremely paranoid have been since I was pretty young
but like a lot of people are, but I don't think most people would describe it as a "crippling fear"
I mean do know you're very conscious about your weight
you have that fear?
My guess was that you were gonna mention my crippling fear of becoming obese
na I'm limiting myself to just this specific topic
Oh well that's kinda boring I thought you were gonna roast me way harder
and being fat is unattractive
you just seem to really care about people's attractiveness overall for you opinion of them
but that's kinda it
and yes, that is rules 1 and 2
ok that was easy
Boooo
league
Are you gonna continue
Be attractive / don't be unattractive ?
you bring up the attractiveness of people, especially people you meet far more than anyone else I've ever met. It really seems to matter to you and influence your opinion of them, even if you have no intention of having a relationship with them. And an important note is I mean both rule 1 and 2 of attractiveness (do you know what those are?)
Go for it
want to hear my psychoanalysis of you?
`I'm not sure it's mostly a gut reaction`
but most of the time it isn't an inconvenience, so what about then?
I'm not sure it's mostly a gut reaction sometimes it's because it's literally inconvenient to be around them i.e. the reason I'm thinking about it is bc I just met a girl in the theater pit who's suuuper nice but initially I was just annoyed bc she was taking up so much physical space rip
why is your initial impression decidedly negative?
Not to say that I hate them or can't befriend them or anything like that but my initial impression is usually decidedly negative and if I'm honest that's definitely the reason
Is it morally wrong that I am definitely auto-inclined to dislike obese people
I think the actual plan is just by a 16U sever rack and build a second computer
for me, yea but dual gpus are a pain
uh probably not for what Alan is doing
Buy another gpu, that tends to help right?
buy a Ryzen 9?
so now Idk what to do
but they did
Also if they didn't kill 1st and 2nd gen with 3rd gen then yes
uh Salina do you have a points system for hurting pet?
more points if the roomba screams when it hits shit
A roomba is a type of house pet
jkjk
<@!193229269076279298> hey noah wanna buy the threadripper you were contemplating to get this project off the ground? :p
that's fair
it'll probably be fine once it's hosted on not-alan's-laptop
UBC: "until beta, cya"
rip UBC wifi?
which was probably more than what I could've asked for lol
but it did work
Groupify Alpha Version "will break if literally anything goes wrong" summary:
- it works unless you're on UBC's wifi
- it's extremely fragile (error-prone at nearly every step) but it does work if everything goes perfectly
- was hosted on my laptop because I haven't found a good place to host it yet
it works!!! mostly

kinda annoyed @ myself I just wrote a 1000-word ramble for fun in like 30 mins yet it took me over 5 hours to finish a 400-word research proposal the other day
as soon as I figure out how to port forward on this new fucking router my dad made me set up
I'm just about ready for a test launch
alright
Yeah sure
Oh
and letting me see if it crashes
using the website when it's up
What would that involve
in the event that I manage to get Groupify Web up and running tonight would anyone wanna be the first ~~test subject~~ user?
hey

I've never written something that couldn't get up and running within 30 minutes
fran cmon now
im skeptical
👀
but give me a sec to test the real program
nothing yet
what did you break
hehe
definitely
because if I wrote it that means it's gotta work
nah
should I test this thing I wrote before I implement it in the real thing
hmm
(working on Groupify)
Ah yes
I just find it ironic bc I pay way more attention to us news when I'm out of the country
No yeah I am the same at school I'm always in the library bc I don't trust myself to Actually Be Productive in my room lol
You are directly studying polisci in Canada
Maybe it's the same for you but with that particular set of variables
If I'm at udub or using my laptop, I'm in work mode baby
I'm brain: desktop = relax
I know damn well I have a hard time studying on my desktop cause u use it for games all the time
Different environments affect your mindset
Maybe I'm subconsciously deciding fuck it I'm not gonna use my brain at all while on break
I'm not entirely sure why I did p much the same thing in December
I watched most of the Nevada debate and listened to one (1) podcast analyzing it after but that's literally it, I mostly ignored everything this week
Strangely Im much more motivated to follow news n shit when I'm in Canada
(real or fake, they're real to your head)
you're just acting good because you fear the repercussions
if you need something to keep you in line then you're not actually good
this is how I feel
^
Sometimes blind faith works better than anything concrete
But if you need religion because your morals are fucked up then that's an iffy moment
If religion gets you off the booze then good for you
Not to say that's inherently bad
strong opinion
that is a
wowzah
Mentally or physically
The only reason why you would convert is that you're fucked up
Cause like if you're not born into it
Oh my opinion is that people who convert are the weirdos
Id be down for that
If the world was 99.999999999999999% people like jiayi and me
and otherwise they'd just feel less motivated to do good
or do they gravitate to religion bc they need to justify being nice
do ppl gravitate to religion because they are good
so it's much easier to tear down in my opinion
hmm that is kind of an interesting thought
they're just dicks
people that are dicks don't have this entire structure in their head built up about why they're being a dick
just cause long term the problem seems much easier to deal with
rip
I think I'd still go with people that are dicks
if I was constructing an imaginary society would I rather have super nice helpful missionaries or people that are dicks
you know the feeling "I wish there was more people like *this* in the world"
just thought of something
hmm
but it also feels very weird
*very* nice
had three missionaries stop me while I was on my way to the bus stop about 2 weeks ago
Why are religious people so nice
ah
Also extremely nice dude
Also tried to get me to go to a religious thing
A random guy asked to sit with me at lunch
oh man
But I'm still riding the high from talking to him
I am unsure
has he gotten over his fear of snakes
God I love that guy

its so
so is that a yes or no

also the current look of the login launcher thing
kewl
nah with this group it's just me being panicked support
"league"
"well
"but ooh damn some times league is
LoL = table flip
but also
"ooh games with amigoes!"
oofs
im thinking like
i aint even sure
thats a damn good question
if you don't wanna, that's fine haha
wanna join us for league by any chance?
but you do you
legit i don't
👁️ 👄 👁️ i think you do
guess i blinked and missed it
i can't see the meaning in this
eye don't understand what you mean
👁️
yes i do mean that
i do have some fun ER stories about it
you talkin bout me actually downing the whole water bottle down my trachea?
and it's not very pleasant to look at
medical suction tubing looks like a pain to do
pls no aspiration
also why is it that, at the ripe age of damn-close-to 19, i am still not able to make water go down the right tube
i like you're enjoying good media even if its not my way
yes, at double speed and giving no fucks
everyone consumes the media in their own way
but i am a filthy casual w a love for spoilers
like i know a lot about hollow knight, soma, and some other games
but most of the time i don't do the actual shit
sorry for what lol
i like doing lore research and theorycrafting
i'm sorry
but neat
to me
oh thats wack
just watched the show
never read the books
never played the games
i did a really deep witcher lore dive a couple years ago
rip
and ill eventually get around to the games
just picked up the first book (not started reaind it though)
so i was confused as shit 90% of the time but still enjoyed it
watched the show
i think im doing things in the wrong order
saaaaame
and i don't want to wait for the next season but here we are :(
the doppler bit was p neat actually
but i also just enjoyed the show altogether
also the brokilon forest plot line has a couple of p bad holes
haha yeah
it just felt like the writing was a tad inconsistent
like she went to the magical plastic surgeon dude and he was like are you sure and she was like fuck YES make me pretty
but in the show yen knows she gave it up
because in the game, tissaia's book snippet estabs that sorceresses go infertile, presumably as a byproduct of using magic and such
the line makes more sense in the game than in the show
but during her transformation she knows she gave it up by her own choice
like i get it and i do like some of the plotlines that are relevant to it (i.e. her escaping the assassination attempts to save the baby) but she has one line where she's like THEY TOOK IT (fertility) FROM ME
also i kinda didn't like how much yenn was angsting over wanting a kid ngl
but overall really solid looking show
b/c there were some moments where everything muddied together
i kind of wished the striga fight had a *bit* more contrast
yeah the cinematography was cool
landscape shots were lit
why?
to which my answer is just....
instead we have like soldiers against a lot of people in gowns at the battle of sodden
felt like a lot of wasted opportunity for costume design
idk i wish the witches weren't so married to their gowns in the show
like wtf man
they make her look kinda dowdy ngl
also i kind of hate her outfits
fine I'll agree to compromise there
but she just straight up had brown hair in the show
in the books she's a more muted ginger
nah
she needs to be capital RED redhead
yeah I agree with Triss
but granted the game version like REALLY cranked up how red it was
all the characters are pretty spot on with their characterization
i kinda wish Triss's hair wasn't quite so brown
therefore pretty reflective of the witcher narrative
yeah they be a bit shameless
....
lots of tits
thoughts, feelings, concerns?
I may have binged it all in 3 sessions but it was worth it
binged it in 2 nights
i watched it a while ago
oooh
my fucking head hurts but it was good
just finished the witcher netflix series
But if it's not too late I am very intrigued
Ok I unfortunately have plans for tonight and idk when I'll be back
And I have time to call
I also have a funny story from tonight
Yes!
Y'all should call me to talk about it lmaoooo
!!!!!!!
have fun haha
oh man
oh boy
YESSSSSSSS
MY ROOMIE NEXT YEAR IS JUST AS OBSESSED WITH MBTI AS I AM
I'm at the Vancouver women's memorial march and holy shit I just saw an indigenous girl w the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen in my life
Unrelated but I can’t fucking wait until my prefrontal cortex is completely developed
and it scars like a bitch
when i get a bad breakout it's nodular acne
it's fine until it isn't
my skin is just a cranky bitch
As long as my skin looks ok with foundation on I’m happy
Salina generally has much smoother skin though she also has concerns i.e. high sensitivity
I could not imagine pulling off the "glass skin" kinda thing
I would definitely not say I have near perfect skin, I have a lot of texture blackheads dark spots bad dark circles that are only less noticeable bc glasses and the occasional breakout, though it's much less bad than in the past
Lol Helen squared
Helen my sister is also on curology now!
And Alan yes I was aware that this is common
That's horrifying Fran
^ <@503787499605458954> this is what I meant by the guys thing
My skincare consists of body soap when I shower given I swam that day
And I could always win against past me in a sumo wrestling match
Hmm idk if I could kick past me’s ass, but I theoretically should be slightly stronger
It saves so much time not to think about what I should use varying day to day
But I’ve found that only using the same three products has been great
The other solution is to completely cut out all added sugar and gluten
It’s slightly expensive (almost $20 a month) but it’s been the most effective medication for my current acne
I started using Curology
The only thing I added is an acne cream at night
I now use the same cleanser and moisturizer all the time, neither of which have active ingredients like salicylic acid
Funny thing is my 2020 “new year resolution” as far as skincare goes has been using less products
All three of you do
Cindy you have nearly perfect skin
:(
Almost sounds like a drumbeat
Very rhythmatic in nature
I am the very soul of wit
Lovely parade of words you got going on there
> did she patent a human expression
did she patent a human expression?? bitch you ain't special
do I even need to respond to this
you can't steal Salina's main tagline for me
sighhhhh
depending on who you ask the holes in people are the best part
but even if they're not obvious to other people I would like to get rid of the little holes in the middle of my face lmao
I honestly can't tell if I'm just harsh on myself or if they're as obvious as I think they are
my biggest skin annoyance is blackheads
I abused my skin less than she did so I don't actually think I have any noticeable scars, I do still get the occasional breakout though
my sister has really bad scarring in places
my mom still gets p bad hormonal acne
mine too
... or maybe from his more recent years, it's hard to tell
my dad has visible scarring from his teen years
I get that
my whole family is cursed w shitty skin and I currently still have a massive and painful pimple on my chin
grats
I honestly don't really remember what I looked like at the peak of my preteen acne (combo of avoiding pics, avoiding my reflection, and repression) but my skin has definitely improved in the last few years, and I also think it's gotten better in the past month or so that I actually started a hardcore regimen
but i had to dilute it down a bit
i could use it normally after about 2 months
rip
my skin was *real* bad at prom
literally 45% alc
Ingredients
Active: Salicylic Acid 2%...Purpose: Acne Medication. Inactive: Alcohol Denat. (45%), Water, Witch Hazel (Hamamelis Virginiana) Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth7, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Matricaria (Chamomilla Recutita) Flower Extract, Methyl Gluceth20, Benzophenone4, Blue 1, Propylene Glycol, Fragrance.
my skin purged the shit out of itself
the alcohol probably also didn't help
i tried the TO SA serum the day before prom
could be the SA
I remember only being able to use netrogena's once or twice a week before irritation began
or the combo of both
it's likely more the alcohol than the SA
I use a 2% treatment every day
Neutrogena's thing has 2% SA while the Aveeno stuff I'm using now has only 0.5%
salicylic acid is super common alan
it doesn't really feel skin like
it breaks down your skin's oils
they feel like mildly leathery
that doesn't take a rocket scientist
... ofc that's gonna happen
if you let your hands sit in isopropyl alcohol for several minutes it makes them dry as fuck
ah this gets to the thing I learned yesterday
Salicylic Acid
I think I might know why
I guess
*did
how do you live
n o ah
holy shit the first ingredient is alcohol
call it a day
most of the time i just rinse my face off
i use my serums after i shower
rip
mostly my skincare consists of me being lazy and fighting with my mask
I tried that stuff for a little, also found it to be very strong
yea even I don't use that anymore
the neutrogena astringent
was not a fun time
what the hell do you use noah?
lmao
holy shit
my face was peeling
salina has p sensitive skin
fucking chemically burned me
your shit
Salina can't touch anything I use
okay but *literally nothing*
well yeah obviously but even if you have perfect skin you should be doing some basic skincare
and there are some people who do the same thing and come out with all sorts of stuff
there are some people who do literally nothing and have little to no flaws
wanna know an intresting skin care fact I figured out yesterday
I really think it just depends on the guy
like obviously I cleansed toned and moisturized before but I feel like the baseline is much higher for girls than guys
was one of my 2020 resolutions actually
skincare is something I've only kinda gotten into very recently
I get very oily and gross after a long day but I gotta be careful bc it can also get dry enough to flake in the winter
which usually involve food lmao
most oils I find come from whatever activity I engage in
I have oily-combo
interesting
so I'd guess dry
well my face dries out easily
well like oily/dry/normal/combination
wdym
~~yellow~~
what's your skin type?
so yeah
ofc you have to keep drinking water and stuff but staying hydrated should be a higher priority than skincare if we're being honest
or else my face will dry out too fast or become irritated
I've found my balance to be using only one of any of these products in a given span of 12 hours
plus their tone-correcting moisturizer in the mornings
specifically their in-shower cleanser combined with their overnight cream
I use a lot of Aveeno's products because I've found them to be gentler for my relatively delicate skin
after that it's finding the balance of keeping your face clean without literally burning your skin off
e.g. after cooking breakfast usually there's a whole bunch of vapor that goes up in my face and I can take notice of it and go actively wash my face
first off just realizing when your face is oily/dirty is a big bonus
lmaoooo
do you have any idea how long I've been waiting for someone to ask me
what's your skincare routine
wait alan
I mean part of it is just that when you're younger your muscle to mass ratio is better (I think?) but yikes I'm so much slower than I used to be
swimming is definitely the one I feel saddest returning to though
it's funny bc I've never considered myself a particularly athletic person but looking back I've been actively doing at least one sport at all times for my entire life
I feel like I've gotten more athletic but also less athletic lmao I used to be a lot more flexible re: skating and had better breath control re: swimming
but I have a lot more muscle than he does
lol past me and current me both suck at cardio still so nothing's changed there
but she was definitely better at running
well I'm not sure bc hiking and skiing and stuff
she was also much better at cardio
I've definitely lost some of that
old me actively did martial arts though
I look better as far as body goes
I'm definitely stronger
you know I'm not actually sure if I could
from a few years ago
I could kick my own ass
oh that too
I am unsure if I am in better shape than before tbh
idk what happened but I like it
I remember when it was stick-straight
hair got a lot wavier for some reason
different glasses
I feel like I do but also don't
almost like I evolved or something lol
different hair glasses composure style attitude skincare
I realized just last night that I look a lot different than I did a few years ago
lmfao
I'm glad 😉
I know
don't worry
thanks babe so are you
cindy you're cute
sometimes when I'm sitting on my bed I'll look up and see my reflection and just go damn I'm cute. I strongly suspect that this only works bc I'm far enough away to not pick my face apart. but it's a nice self-self-confidence boost
productive talk
cool
no
<@!470822754262712329> what is empathy
are you off your meds or something
<@!470822754262712329> i want vindication
('Д')
¯\_(シ)_/¯
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
and *programming*
at *anime*
you're trying to beat me
trying to get you to admit anime is not best video media format
the conclusion i was trying to draw
no fuck you
fuck you saw which route i was taking
ゴゴゴゴゴ
jojos >= anime
ゴゴゴゴゴ
so jojo's != anime?
ゴゴゴゴゴ
jojo transcends being anime
the fuck wrong whichu
ゴゴゴゴゴ
not Jojo's???????????
nope he's fine
kobayashi-san chi no maidragon is the best anime ever created
what's the best anime ever created?
*Fuck*
thats *the problem*
he's working *just as intended*
FYCK
this ain't it, chief
high five <@!470822754262712329>
no fuck you
no, fuck you, Starbot
get fucked
no fuck you
also fuck you
also since 64 is a power of 2 i feel like a score of 64 is so logical that it counts as a, like, 86
bam
yes
can you divide it by two?
too late
quick can you divide 1925798236 by 3?
disgusting
all odd baby
as nice as that is my favorite number is 3
64 would give you a power of two though
65 then
FUCK
67 it is
<:PK:610932426147102740>
therefore emotion
it's an emoji
smiley brings it down again
quality
🙃 yes but fuck you
but now i proposed a logical reflection so ill bump it back up to 68
saying that, im clearly slightly more feelings based so ill bump it down to 67
wow
kinky
68, then, just to deny you the satisfaction
wait a minute
*cindy why*
why yes it does
some things are a spectrum
69 sound good?
let him live
boy pick a spot
*15 point range*
60-75
uhh
25
well in a conflict for me it really varies
ooh i'd love to join this conversation
I rate myself 70-75
helen I rated you 85
alan and I were chattng about this
in regards to conflict, which are you more likely to favor in figuring out a solution
ok first of all, what counts as feeling
interesting, our scores are backwards
90
I think I’m like 75
well yeah actually
god dammit helen
So basically we’re doing Mbti analysis now?
I'm 50
rate yourself
0 is all feelings 100 is all logic
we're adding a new axis to the WD alignment chart: thinky-feely
no
yes but it doesn't bother me 😉
I’ve never had this experience
Y'all ever see a cute gal but then they start talking and it turns out they're a dude
and my mom is an economist working as a chiropractor
my dad is an engineer working is sales
He only saw the light after his college career was over
My dad is a triple physics major working in CS
my dad is a CompE major working in EE
I hate EE
like EE I hate it, but I'm glad someone is doing it
nobody wins
it's all theory and intuition but there's math involved
it's like math except it's all theory and intuition
comp sci sucks
I'm so glad I'm not doing CS
I'm actually in my CS lab right now
that's a high tier insult for a programmer
defriend them
Oof my friends told me I was HTML/css Today
"good with kids"
Gene has a bubbly personality like scratch
"If you were a programming language you'd be scratch"
nah an insult would be HTML/CSS
I feel like that's an insult
gene
who is scratch?
Pretty accurate
david is GameMaker Studio
Lmao better than Noah
bethany is swift
so in all
Noah: C
Salina: C++
Helen: C#
Cindy: Java
Alan: JavaScript
Jarrett: R
Jiayi: Python
Fran: Matlab
I'd give myself JavaScript because it's like Java in a way but more like Python and R (cough, weeb)
she's pretty popular
Huh really
Java I'd give to Cindy
actually wait
JavaScript I would give to Cindy
Lmao
whoops
Honestly idk much about JavaScript
similar enough to C but just better in every way
Maybe
I feel like Salina is C++ actually
Salina might be JavaScript
hmm
Cindy is... ???
Hahaha
Fran is Matlab
Jiayi can be Python and Jarrett can be R
yeah python vibes
Jarrett and Jiayi both give off python vibes
you're C# because you have close ties to Microsoft
Partially because you’re associated with tea which is similar to coffee
I think you’re Java
or even assembly
LMAO
Noah would be C
let's set a baseline first
hmm
<@!478706068223164416> if everyone here was a programming language what would we be
and virtual fireplace
will be equipped with a full theater setup and disco lights
come to Wen Tea Studio
next year
3fancy5me
damn fancy
*aka still more than our tuitions*
for two it should be comparable to dorming
and if we're talking apartments fran and I are gonna get one next year
*we're* a classy bitch
excuse you
> I'm a classy bitch
Also keep in mind that my tuition is low enough that I'm willing to spend more on housing
I would prefer to live on campus bc commuting sucks
It depends
would it cost less to enroll in the school and live in on campus housing then to rent an actual apartment?
hmm
It's an option
Yeah
I’m pretty sure those are part of campus housing? Idk
you're gonna get a studio apartment in *Vancouver*?
🧻🧻🧻
that's a new one
toilet paper shaming
lmao
Oh right I forgot
No I have a communal bathroom
Do you not?
Lol you have to buy toilet paper
200% worth it I ain't fuckin w that plebian shit
The biggest thing I brought w me was a huge Costco pack of nice toilet paper
If I get a large one I’ll share it with my roommate
I definitely want my own fridge next year
What I really want is a fridge but if I get the studio I want I'll have one next year anyways so it doesn't really matter
My mom keeps trying to buy me a shelf
I've increasingly realized that I brought p much the bare minimum to school
Plus some free water bottles
I have. A single mug in my dorm
No when I visited UW and rolled up w a bottle
But I guess you don’t have to think about summer storage
That’s hella extra lol
For your dorm?
I'm a classy bitch
I brought wineglasses
I did
I didn't
did you guys not drink when Cindy came back?
me
Ah
"clean" makes it sound so weird
I don’t understand 80% of that sentence
definitely not when were at Lake Kawaguchi at our Ryokan where we have a first to ten where I played tipsy and he played Incineroar
never drank a day in his life
fran is 100% clean
wait that made me just realize, after the sever "reorganization" do we have anyone left that doesn't drink?
At least it’s not weed
I love smelling like smoke for a week
yes
Another beach bonfire this summer?
I'm down to burn people
I wish to burn you
I wish to burn these people
I also found more friends who like Mbti 😄
I’ve been getting back into MBTI and psychoanalyzing people
I guess I missed your comment abt it
Ye ik
it's p sad but I mean it's not like he was gonna wn
yeah I mentioned it earlier
Not surprised but still kind of a rip
Oh damn Yang dropped
He and Pete are gonna get the same # of delegates
Narrow win
Update: NH just got called for Sanders
I just don't get why he needed to start a vanity campaign instead of putting all his money behind someone else
bc that's his only real path to the nomination
it feels like fighting dirty
another side note that no one but political nerds will care about: the fact that bloomberg's whole strategy is basically to cause a contested convention REALLY irks me
closed bernie's lead to ~1.7%
oh damn I just checked NH results buttigieg could still win
yeah ik
if y'all uw people are interested in voting in the primary you should do that, btw
also i think I'd have to register as a democrat in wa state
pls dont say that ever again lmao
oh god your brand
by the time washington votes I feel like it'll be mostly decided tbh
bc getting an absentee ballot would be kind of annoying
probably not even though it goes against my whole brand
perhaps
I'm not sure
Do yall plan to vote in the primary?
enthusiasm
much
so
.... wooo enthusiasm
I kinda care but mostly don't I'm voting d no matter who
falling asleep in class? pop open the news
yeah ok same
but i've been keeping tabs on the elections
i don't have a strong preference for left candidates
i'm just like not trump
at this point
my theory is on the gradual intensification of extremism of elected officials
do y'all care who wins?
it's been interesting to watch at least
i could see that yea
it's still pretty open sanders has the best chance but it's only like ~45%
anyways this has been a super messy primary so far
~~shh we gotta act like that's not happening~~
~~checks and balances that the GOP is currently allowing trump to lowkey destroy~~
lol
*** c h e c k s a n d b a l a n c e s***
well you know
shh
uh
somehow a guy with the name castro in a position of power seems
ok cool
or am i just pulling out stereotypical names
yeah
julian castro?
if warren was to win she p much confirmed that castro would be her running mate
i doubt biden will keep the black voters ngl
k just making sure i got the facts straight
yeah
which is impressive in its own right
I guess biden could make a comeback if black voters really do stay loyal to him but I think it's very doubtful at this point bc he's gonna get crushed 3 times in a row before that south carolina
but managed to boost turnout like mad
and lost out super narrowly
abrams was the person who ran for GA gov right?
especially since none of the top contenders are strong w minorities anymore
i could see that
since the field is overwhelmingly white it'd be very smart to pick a nonwhite running mate
the 2 vp possibilities that are getting the most buzz are harris and stacey abrams
i know you said kamala would prob be a strong contender for a ticket
depends on who wins, but mostly no
errrrr
do you think klob could make a vp bid?
she's been buddying up to klob a lot lately but she and bernie have been friends for years and obviously share the most liberal ideas
I think w warren it'd be like 40-60 amy-bernie
I'm 80% sure biden would endorse amy
bern baby bern
if biden or butt drop I think she has a much better chance but as things stand it's looking like we're gonna feel the bern
ngl i think warren's spat w bernie really didn't look good on her
as shitty as that sounds
but i also think it is more than likely she'll lose it
i think if klob continues her momentum i think she might stand a chance
warren hit frontrunner status in like october and then got trampled bc she didn't handle attacks well
i could see that
I feel like warren peaked too early and klob too late
yeah
I know it's weird that she's only rising now
i feel like klobuchar could be a really solid candidate but she hasn't really got the traction she needs to get farther in front of the race
we haven't
plot twist
we have had 4 yrs to get our shit together
yeah kinda
somehow, the dem party continues to be a disaster
well
ngl I've been optimistic and I'm trying not to be too cynical but I'm really prepping myself for another 4 years of trump
yeah rip
because money is one thing, but votes is a whole other donkey
so i'm saying how well can he actually mobilize them
oh lol
i meant part of the surge of donors was hillary's remarks
I fucking hate you starbot
you shut up
he kept surging in the polls after that and I saw way more people telling her to shut up than actually agreeing
really? I don't think hillary talking shit about him did anything at all
but i think part of it is people being mad about hillary's remarks
i wonder if he can sway better turnout if he does get the nomination
he's gotten a kind of impressive amt of donors
good luck w that
so uhhhh
so far, turnout has not improved
he's a very factional and ideological candidate
not convincing swing voters
his pitch is mostly about improving turnout
if he picks a good vp I can make peace w his candidacy but I also genuinely think he'd lose in the general
mhm
anyways my single biggest problem w bernie is that he's fuckin 80
I've been introspecting about this for a while
sounds like you have some introspection to do
rip?
uh
and I also have a hard time pinning down why. is it internalized misogyny?? is it that I'd prefer a gay guy to win than a woman? idk
L
I'm not sure what it says about me that despite that i personally do prefer Buttigieg
bc she's also a pretty great speaker, also from the midwest, also a left-of-center moderate, and has years of senate and electoral experience and actually Accomplishing Things
his few blunders all have to do w winning minorities and it really doesn't look great, the fact that he's gay is a turnout problem waiting to happen, and Klob has a really good point when she says they're really similar policy-wise and she's objectively way more qualified. I think most of her resentment @ him has to do w the fact that he's doing better than her despite that, and basically the only discernable reason why is that he's a Man
(huge caveat incoming)
BUT
also he and his husband are absolutely adorable
ok I will note that I really like his policy proposals, I think political twitter (generally very left) labeling him as a conservative or "wall street pete" is definitely incorrect and pretty unfair, he's a really impressive speaker and debater, and the strength of his campaign (especially their ground game) is a huge testament to his leadership
saying "i'm a gay mayor in pence's indiana" is a great zinger but i feel like that doesn't really hold much weight
his inexperience really doesn't look great
i do agree that buttigeg should drop
L
i think some leftists wouldn't vote and the right would pour out in droves
if Bernie wins the nom and loses to trump that'd be some twisted poetic justice
maybe in a couple more decades
yeah
no offense
i don't think amer would elect a gay president
L
*i like pete but he's gay* taken out of context
sanders has been pulling ahead w (from what i can tell) a kinda significant lead
yeah i think biden is kinda screwed
it's weird
nor is she my personal top choice
I don't think she's gonna win though
anyways of the democratic field I think klobuchar is probably the best gen election candidate at this point. biden has a Lot of baggage, I like pete but he's gay (and also doesn't have much experience), warren is already near-irrelevant, sanders is literally a socialist
(continue)
I just took THE BITTEREST sip of this orange juice and I felt absolutely betrayed by the world for a second
biden is literally the only candidate who's gotten a decent amount of minority support but that's not gonna save him at this point
they also have the same problem w the minority vote, esp w black voters
I'm removing that one
that's old
stop
(dab)
but they're like almost the same candidate as far as policy positioning w pete slightly further left
stop
klob's hatred of buttigieg ~~is hilarious and understandable~~ is something to behold
personally I'm pulling for buttigieg now that yang's out but it would make way more sense for him to drop and endorse amy than the reverse
tbh if the party was serious about stopping sanders they'd pressure biden and buttigieg to drop
I will say that #klobucharge is also an excellent hashtag
I know lol
*butt/klob*
I think they're both good candidates but they're splitting the vote between them, so they're giving bernie an open path to the nom rn
the butt/klob situation kind of annoys me
Me and keyboard aren’t getting along
Oof
Right
I was eight hahahahaha
OMG
OKG
it just rolls off the tongue so well
also yang gang is one of the best hype group names I've heard in a bit
you weren't wrong <@!340319804747415553>
2) "If you vote for me I'll give you $1000 bucks a month"
Jkjk
2) money
1) Asian American representation
Yang's appeal to someone like me could be summed up with two phrases
also no one cares but my take on the NH primary is that sanders is gonna win but buttigieg would have won if the moderate vote was more consolidated
L
I strongly suspect that obama has been waiting for biden to drop so he can endorse someone else lmao
speaking of endorsements and *important* endorsements
if he wants a career in politics going forward it's v smart to drop early, endorse someone else, ride the goodwill he's gained in the dem party
the longevity and fundraising numbers speak for themselves
and managed to establish a more loyal and enthusiastic, if niche, voter base than a lot of other more traditional candidates
but he actually had a very detailed and thought-out platform
I dismissed him as that at first too
I think a lot of people expected that bc they saw him as a single-issue candidate who was only running to raise awareness for ubi
a lot of people were expecting him to stay till the end, I didn't think so
I'm glad Yang ran
😦
I appreciate the straightforwardness
“I am the math guy, and it’s clear from the numbers we’re not going to win this campaign,” he said. “So tonight I’m announcing that I am suspending my campaign.”
Yang is dropping and I'm not surprised but I am very sad
Actually nvm it's not that surprising I opened cnn for like 5 mins and apparently she's the new traditional media darling
he's on track for 4th or 5th
I think biden's finished tbh
I'm kinda surprised
also klobuchar is doing much better than expected so far
wow, bill weld might actually steal some delegates from trump
It's about Clearview AI if anyone's heard of it
This is fascinating and kinda terrifying
https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ANRQSAgjGnTTb8quXZyu6?si=p0AGYaqOQYeQK-JENTKogg
But all the customers are gone now
They put on this music to chase out the customers
lol
Not the restaurant
I mean the catalyst members are
They’re playing trashy electro pop
We’re in a public restaurant
It’s not sus at all
lemme know what the party is like 👀
you're gonna do great helen
This is intimidating
all the catalyst rushees here seem very competent
People brought bottles of spiked coke and vodka in vitamin water bottles
So we’re performing an aggressive takeover by blasting trash music and interspersing ourselves all around
But when we got here the part was already full of customers because the restaurant can’t kick people out
So catalyst reserved a part of an on campus restaurant for our party
it would literally just be me though lol
maybe I should make a channel for politics related stuff
evelyn yang is so pretty
Bumble keeps advertising on campus which is pretty funny
Hm I haven’t seen very many crazy things
Just realized I never answered
Hm
what's the craziest thing you've witnessed since going to college
lol
Especially who in catalyst they’ve hooked up with
Some people told stories about their hookups and stuff
that's kinda boring
4. Hottest/cutest rushees (catalyst members not allowed to answer this)
3. Hottest/cutest catalyst members
2. Rice purity score
1. When was the last time you masturbated
During one game the questions became pretty standardized for everyone
Mine are always very wholesome because compared to everyone else I have little tea to spill
what kind of questions did you get asked during "sexual hot seat"?
I find it interesting that board and card games seem to be such a thing over there
For the past week my rush events have included two nights of secret hitler and two nights of sexual hot seat
rushing for a sorority/frat is usually A Lot of partying. and being judged very harshly (at least in sororities)
For lack of a better phrase, catalyst is a competitive tech social networking group
I imagine the process is roughly similar except for less demonic chanting
what is it then?
Also I have never rushed for a frat so I would not know
wait
This is not an SLG
what's different from rushing for a frat
ok what is rushing for a SLG like
Office themed because this is a catalyst rush event
when you're asking a question like that grammar is not the most important part, flow is
why is the party office themed?
ehh who cares
Kind of
The other girls are wearing typical party attire
what aren't you wearing = what are not you wearing
my wording is more grammatically correct than yours
So I’m wearing my nice interview shirt, gray sweatpants, fuzzy socks and foam soled shoes
close enough, your phrasing is clunky through
"What aren't you wearing"
what's the inverse, what are you not wearing?
the inverse question is much better
Theme
I dressed up as the Skype interview the@w
I actually tried to follow the “office” theme
I am with Cindy on beer
what are you wearing?
I regret my outfit
idk what even to ask at this point
hmm
I know
I like beer
you like beer more than I do I have not found one I enjoy in the slightest
Now I question the white claw
I actually haven't tried most hard seltzers
I also had white claw and that was good too
Ok so my taste isn’t entirely trashy
oh good choice
Love it
I’m drinking fireball right now
what's your favorite type of alcohol you've tried
To answer your question I could but I won’t
No
can you please correct the typing error
AMA
Hello I’m I#tipsy
so far this is the best-moderated dem debate imo
big fan of camo print in general tbh
and the italics come out
the *meaning* of it changes based on the *context*
camo has a lot of use in urban, street, and underground styles
we're talking strictly in the realm of appearance and aesthetics
anyone outside of active service persons who wear camo pants in an attempt to actually camoflauge themselves is delusional
unless youre in the military
i am also anti camo pants
or fake exhausts
it's like fake vents
camo in general looks bad as a fashion statement
camo pants look stupid
@someone who needs to hear this
just because you wear nothing but jeans every day doesn't mean other pants aren't good
camo pants are fine
SEE
Also I forgot to say this earlier but camo pants are super valid
part of it being that guys just don't need a ton of variation so Uniqlo sells basically everything that an average guy needs in a wardrobe
I can agree with the uniqlo is better for guys thing
that one
Is there a cringe emoji I can use to react to that message
Additional hot take that Uniqlo is better for guys than girls
I agree w your Uniqlo hot take btw
jkjk
stabbing albert with a stick is very impressive apparently
You've said that before and it continues to baffle me
idk i just thought you seemed cool
Idk how the fuck I had friends honestly
Hello I would like to deeply apologize for like 75% of my behaviour and personality during like all of elementary and middle school, I have not forgotten but I would like to
I'm nowhere near Nicholas level, but generally my shoulders are the problem point
I'll show you something called "slim fit" that might be of interest
jarrett I still need to bring you clothes shopping
i always go for medium
but width wise im like a small
what you're tall
height wise im a medium/large
i'm very un-stick-like for an asian
american sizes are like sacks
they tend to actually fit my stick-like body
from my perspective asian sizes are shitty
man asian sizes are great
the woes of being an average sized man in an average sized world
in asia there's pretty much always stock in my size
that's sad
because if I'm supposed to be "small" here then why do all the small sizes always sell out faster than the medium and the large
how?
somehow I feel cheated
I'm a small here but medium in asia
I'm a size XXL anywhere in Asia lmao
but could also be construed as racist
hey if I went to Indonesia to buy pants you can go to Japan to buy bras
quite an accurate assumption
or maybe just an assumption that Americans are just larger people
i'm not going to japan to buy a bra
lol
maybe it's the "influenced by anime expectations" phenomenon
why again are bra sizes not split into two numbers?
you'd have to go overseas to find out if they have a different range of sizes there
well they do size their stuff up in America
they think everyone is a D cup even though it's a japanese brand
lmao
you looked at the bra sizing system?
I never get sized incorrectly
they only use Small Medium Large
I find it quite intuitive actually
really?
heat tech stuff literally saved my ass from freezing in jeans several times last month
i hate their bra sizing system
uniqlo's got bomb inner wear though
lol
oops
number of times mbti has been brought up with the mention of helen: also 2
but also
lol
in the last week: 2
these days i will bring up MBTI very frequently in all my conversations
what's your count now
adding 1 to the number of times mbti has been brought up
i guess as an ENTJ i don't have any
where is my internal logical consistency (Ti)
lol
wait i just contradicted myself
long sleeve shirts, i'll buy a functional one from costco for $10
i don't spend money on t-shirts usually
by shirt i mean not a plain shirt
$15 on a shirt is what Uniqlo charges for a regular UT shirt
my white jacket was $180
tall boots, i'd spend up to $100 for something that will last a few years
i have a $200 (sale price) winter coat, which is the most expensive clothing item I own
i think it's worth spending more on heavy coats and good shoes
but it's from REI and more for hiking
I have a $250 down jacket
I spend ~$40 for jeans but wear them for several years before buying new ones, so we're closer than farther
cannot justify over 25 for a light top; if it's a plain shirt i expect under $15
20-30 is also good for heftier tops like sweaters, if they are very good looking sweaters
i feel like $20-30 for a pair of jeans is ok if it's a really good fit
(not about to buy a $180 down jacket from Uniqlo when the same price can get me a pretty beefy hiking jacket from Columbia)
in elementary school i bought $3 shirts
we probably have different price point standards
boring? yes. overpriced? for the spendier stuff yes
most brands are overpriced (i only shop sales) but some are decidedly not boring
hot take, doesn't apply to Costco
not-so-hot take: i hate translating binary to mips
that's applicable to most brands
hot take
hot take: uniqlo is boring and overpriced
uniqlooooo
and whatever my style is, it's definitely not tied to either american or modern asian culture
i don't really have style
i don't really have one style
andfortherecordmystyleisWestAsianAmerican
7th grade i was clocking like a flat 7 min
might be 6:20
in 8th grade i think i was a 6:40 mile
:(
i'm slow as shit now tho
cause I beat you by like a min in the mile, and I'm 5' 6" with arthritis
but i have to try really hard since my skin isn't super pale
but i was one of the fastest female runners in our grade
speak mandarin fluently
i can also look like an international student
just gotta upgrade my shoes, put on a mask, get rounder glasses...
idk
but pls dont
`however i will fucking revel in the fact i kicked his ass in the school runs` how slow was he?
yea agreed
if I wanted an international student look I could totally do it though
yup
I am NOT getting DEFENSIVE!!!
you're getting awful defensive about this
I bought them in INDONESIA
uh huh
they're just CAMO PANTS
but those camo pants look awful fishy sometimes
ik
I do not live the hypebeast lifestyle
and for the RECORD
hahahaha
I just realized I might not have a strong bid in this argument if one of my closest friends wears toe shoes
uh
well
oh
they're flip flops
these aren't sandals
but wearing socks and sandals to anything but a lawn party is deemed both socially and pragmatically incorrect
but he look like he tryna live the hypebeast life
not a lil
alan looks like an international student sometimes
look
that's acceptable
look
first of all i willingly admit that I walk around my dorm with socks and flip flops, and i look like a complete tool
GOD HELEN YOU'RE SO ASIAN AND SMART AND STUFF
with that logic
lmao
I think I would be able to, just that the problem is anything I say will also immediately apply to me
lol go off
can I
we can make fun of you for trying to reach ultimate asian levels
you can't make fun of me for being asian because you're also asian
however i will fucking revel in the fact i kicked his ass in the school runs
> he made fun of me for wearing socks with sandals once, and generally for being asian
which is ironic since I would do both of those things to you now but in a different light
so i never wore socks with sandals again and throughout high school i hated seeing people wearing socks and birkenstocks
i remember he was laughing after i got away
v weird
i just don't understand why he felt the need to grab my face
he made fun of me for wearing socks with sandals once, and generally for being asian
we were called down to the principal's before that occurred though
😮
*almost* physical
of what nature
he and I got into several fights
I remember david
but yeah overall not gucci situation
wow cindy was also an ass back then
he tries his best
yup
never dropping a beat
always interrupting at the best of times
thanks bot
very appropriate starbot
you shut up
so i tried talking to cindy about it and then she told me to shut up after a while
it was just a really bad time because i kept telling myself it didn't matter and i felt like i couldn't tell my mom bc she was stressed since she was busy and dad was in china
for fucking square dancing
hhhhhhhh
and then we got paired
we were in the same PE class so the teachers were told to keep us apart
fuck that dude
freaked me out really bad honestly
he randomly followed me into my neighborhood and then randomly grabbed my face in dinosaur park
i can't remember what he did specifically but i just know he was an ass and he said mean things to me in middle school
I know that name, but not the person
aka the david hildebrandt incident
that's a lot of metaphorical phrases
the week after that was just an overall yike on a trike
tbh if i had to forget something it's prob be the post-winter break crisis in 8th grade bc yowch that sucked
lol
no that's not it lol
L
so too fast and too low for anyone to hear in a loud room?
you talk the same way now as you did in fifth grade
but there's this psych phenomenon where you think you remember details that other people say were true, even if they aren't a part of your memory
does someone have photos?
SEE
OH I REMEMBER THAT NOW
pickaxe and all
look the moment someone brings up the time I dressed up as Steve for halloween once is where I draw the line
...
mmmmmmmm
i remember you talked about minecraft a lot
make it stay that way
good
GOOD
so I'm pretty satisfied with my state of memory from then lol
i don't remember any details
luckily that's about as much as I remember from back then
but the concept in abstract? we can keep that
some of the *details*, sure
well hold on actually
😊
we can keep that one
no that one's fine
I’m generally fine with forgetting most of middle school
lmao
<@!478706068223164416> are you referring to me 😡
lmfao
me: my childhood crushes fiascos from elementary school
jk
your face
what's a memory you want to forget
discussion topic #1262
lmao
you're imagining things
did you just call yourself hot?
signed, her prom date
I can vouch
helen's hot
When I heard people talk about her at skyline I thought she wasn’t a skyline student or in a different grade
I never found out who Blair was, never placed name to face
High school kids are more wack than I thought they were
A lot of tea has been spilled about people I had tangential to no connection to
That was quite a conversation I just read
Hello I am back in the world of the living
goodnight sir
😦
and if not you can just drop the class
you got this
you can do it
I wish you luck
well I'm gonna go take a shower then go to bed
ah
and i dont know any good concepts
its mostly just concept work rn
ive done 4
but i need 6
its literally draft 1
and its not even that hard
im just trying to finish a project
man
<@!173668455856340994> it's you and me now
it's been fun folks good night
currently: resenting the need for sleep but I probably should
lol.
although to be fair with my driving I'm surprised I've never gone "off roading"
even at the age of like 8 I thought church was p wack
generally on a road
ANYWAYS
that's kind of a weird thought
I still don't know how you would usually drive to issaquah though
wait no I was thinking of someone completely differen'ts place
hold up
wait do you?
I do live on the plateau
yeah I have no idea then
oh I just realized you don't live on the plateau
that was probably not helpful
stop
I'm blanking on the road name but if you come down from the plateau by lake sammamish, third exit of the roundabout, that one 40 mph zone where everyone goes 50+ before you turn right and then left to get to the costco itself
it's not that close to costco but it's on the way
there's a church close to the dentistry?
there is a bible camp by Costco?
every time I drive by that place on the way to costco I get like flashbacks to that week
lol I actually don't remember why that was a thing
there is a number of sex jokes to be made here
*something* 👀
but, the power it still holds genuinely surprises me. a lot. it's just never been a part of my life like at all except that one time my mom sent my sister and me to bible camp as a punishment for something. hard to relate even if I theoretically understand the reasons
I mean yeah
I think religion is a side effect of our fear for the unknown and unexplainable
never thought it made any sense
I was brought up Christian, went to church for like 13 years
apologies to any religious people here I don't mean that as an insult
*I honestly find it hard to wrap my head around the fact that people still devote themselves to religion
maybe I've just lived a dark godless life or whatever but I honestly find it hard to wrap my head around the fact that people still devote themselves to religion to such a degree
you seem to think it's important, so lets get down to brass tacks on some of these topics
I think it's all stupid
it's your book not mine
fair enough
if you're gonna quote stupid shit at me I'm gonna quote even stupider shit at you
do you have that saved?? lmfao
`I love being a dick
I find it incredibly fun and liberating
I just don't think it's right
So I'm not most of the time
But when I get a chance to be a dick for the right cause
Mmhh, it's good`
but as I brought up
oh I agree
honestly noah doubt this is gonna work but good luck 👍
wow I know absolutely nothing about the bible
Heaven is gone already
and that if you "hate" your life, that means you will have a nice heaven
"Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away."
tell him he's too late
im pretty sure it means that if you fill yourself with earthy pleasures then youll lose your life in heaven
don't eat or drink, just think about god
i actually kinda know about this one
"And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind."
okay so
he has to hate it or he's doing it wrong
<@!173668455856340994> make sure to tell Jeremy he's not allowed to enjoy his life
well, I knew that already
and you'll go to hell
basically if you enjoy your life you're doing it wrong
"He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal."
" And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved. "
you have never qualified I meant like long-enough-to-be-braided
wait didn't jesus have long hair??
oh cool, I'm getting my hair cut this weekend
"For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified."
by the way I think I might have a thing for guys w long hair
I guess it really is supposed to cover the boobs according to the bible
wack
sorry girls, you're not allowed to cut your hair
"But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering."
"Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?"
go to bed lmao
isn't it like 4 or 5 am
Sleep?
should you uh
buddy
<@!233062637922025472>
well, rip
*Rubik's cubes are made in heaven's image*
Humans are made in God's image
lol
" And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal."
um what
2400km on all sides
also Heaven is a cube
etc
"turn the other cheek"
same with "let he without sin cast the first stone"
it all comes down to how much mental gymnastics you're willing to play
"love they neighbor" really trumps almost everything if you want it to
Because again
yes
Christianity can really be great or just flat out awful depending on how you interpret it
"But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:"
"And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also."
those are pretty water tight
but if you look at some of the "rules"
lot of it can just be explained by exaggeration
plus an entire annotated bible to go along with it
1278 pieces long
https://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/abs/nt_list.html
someone with more time than me put this together
That's just jeremy
***what the fuck***
uh
small sample
Damn now that I didn't know
*19*
Jeremy made a 19 page document of what Keon was and wasnt allowed to do
and I love this bit though
ah
like sending Jeremy his wet dreams about him
this just keeps getting more interesting
but he was really weird about it
and was *really* into Jeremy
So Keon is gay
and also
He goes a very love thy sinner hate thy sin way
Jeremy really takes the route of welllllllllll they can do whatever they want to but its still a sin and they're gonna go to hell so i cant really support what they do
which most people dont really care about too much
so he wants new testament stuff?
99% of those laws are from the old testament
but first to answer your point noah
oh yeah i got something to say about that
Keon is gay?
oh nvm just found a pic I kinda knew Clay
like the tax, fish, stoning ones
get all the ridiculous crazy bible rules and read them off to him
any theatre kids
Keon?
nope
Do you know Clay?
I have your soultion
Clay?
ok something else that just occurred to me did we even really have any openly gay people in our class?
-_-
That's super true
but you know its really hard to change someone's mind when their main point is that it's in the bible
a good handfull of conversations actually
I have
cause unlike some "view points" that's something you realistically will run into with him
Jarrett you'll need to have a conversation with him at some point
well
huh
yea
that's some information
*right?*
ok
holy
wait really?
yeah
like list man?
wow
I don't know how to feel about Mark
cause he's uber christian
I found out recently that Jeremy Gunawan is quite homophobic
was actually talking about this with Nicholas today
Sometimes it throws me for an absolute loop
also I think a lot about the conservatives in bede's history class. RIP
and there's nothing inherently wrong w being very conservative if you still accept people but it usually really throws me off when I find out?
I know his dad is apparently slightly off the rails and that's why his older brother is so crazy, because he idolizes him and refuses to challenge anything he says, i.e if what you say goes against what his dad said then he refuses to accept it
that's the thing, he was always really nice
ok half the time the super conservative people are people I totally would've guessed and the other half is people I never would've seen coming
Man I miss Tyler, Ian and Laura
He was always really nice to me, invited me to eat lunch with him, Ian and T.Gall and to play smash and stuff
so that's something
well he's not against trans people
meet his brother
lol, you think he is
but i do like the guy a lot
Antony's pretty cool
He's *extremely* conservative which makes it hard for me to talk to him sometimes
good for him
Antony seems like a really chill, smart, and wholesome guy
^
Dang I'm still shocked she's dating Antony
according to Nicholas, who was in his year and talked with him
also his brother is apparently crazy
Northwestern
where does he go to school?
still?
She is also dating Antony Traino
But at the same time she doesnt seem to care much if I/other people who knew her as Blair call her she/Blair
Aaron is the name
answer is yes
ah
I mean if you don't wanna share that's fine
you were the official help line
<@!173668455856340994> I think you know best
I'm actually not sure about Blair
and yes I do know that story
is Blair trans?? I have been confused about this for. So long. I could've sworn she/they went by a different name for a pretty long time
Wait, Cindy do you know the story about other Cindy staying with the 30 year old guy?
Yes
ok can I ask something
I still think the laptop secret Hitler meetup was great
And yeah that was an all time low for Cindy haha
Yeah during this last break when I came back, it was really fun hanging out with Tina and all you guys
*Goes to stay with a 30 year old guy from Michigan, while lying to her parents*
Cindy got a lot worse before she just now started to turn around
because Blair and Tina have gotten much better
I feel like the scale is distinctly Cindy > Blair > Tina in terms of increasing "personality traits"
***The fact that you guys didn't talk for an entire summer***
And eventually I just felt too annoyed
And she never asked to do things on her own initiative
I always felt like I was the one putting forth the effort, pushing to hang out, asking to do stuff
I broke up with Tina for a reason pretty similar to what you guys were talking about earlier
rip
Sounds right haha
Yup
my Cindy
just like me and Cindy
wow
Yeah, sounds right
I broke up with Blair due to the general instability, clinginess, and anime inspired expectations of life
good
no we're good without the logs lmao I just thought it was gonna get spicier for a sec
no
lol
I remember
OH YEAH!
i remember that being the final push
Okay damn my memory's not as good as I remember haha
"she was on her phone too much and I thought that was kinda rude"
if you want I can go get skype logs
no I distinctly broke up with her
OOOH
Oh wait really
Blair broke up with him
I broke up with Blair
wait who broke up w who
Oh my god I remember that hahaha
Noah editing Blair's breakup letter was a classic moment
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha
I'm happy with how this group is now too
It really didn't take long for him to fit in, wouldn't be the same without him now
<@!173668455856340994> knows what I'm talking about
For me most of my best memories with all you guys were from the end of senior year and the following summer, so that's why I feel like Jarrett's been here forever
and then I get to do a Blair 2.0
now the worst thing that could happen is me and Salina break up
same
I feel like the group has gone through some turmoil, but I'm quite happy with the current state now
really?
`I'm not sure that counts as "xenophobic"` ok obviously I'm joking/exaggerating but was generally kinda opposed to bringing in more people at that point if I'm 100% honest
to be fair again i thought you *really* hated me
never did sorry jarrett you're cool
I'm not sure that counts as "xenophobic"
I remember jarrett dming me to ask why I hate him lol
this is ancient now
I didn't have a super negative idea of him but I was a little xenophobic
i have since gotten better
i was
to be fair
and I believe Cindy thought he was "interesting" as well
🙂
well Salina and him weren't on the best terms orginally
me and you pushed for adding him
For me it feels like he's been here since the start
I'm surprised now that we first added Jarrett to this group for prom
Hahaha, for a lot of us it seems all we needed was a chance to talk
I didn't really have a previous idea of his personality though and we never shared classes or anything. probably weird to say but v glad he asked helen out last year lol
mostly bc I knew he hiked tbh
Yes haha
That One
alan was one of the people I was like, yes. I want to be friends w That One
I know that story :) it's a good one
hmm
who else
ok my first real meeting w Salina is one of my favorite memories tbh
anyways <@!193229269076279298> you were fun to chat with, we got teriyaki in centralia, Salina and I think Abhay were there
lmao
That's brilliant haha
officially the weirdest interaction either of us have had
me and him are sitting in a coffee shop talking at UW, and this black guys walks up wearing a very tight pea trench coat and a crooked not latched blue construction helmet; he's quite built but not like *huge*. He asks Nicholas if he benches, and Nicholas says yes (he's wearing a kinda tight t-shirt, so he knows Nicholas lifts), he then proceeds to ask 
"max bench?"
N: "about 295"
"I'm 245, so you could bench be, right"
N: "yea I mean I guess so"
"so can you bench me out on the street for a video"
N: "... uh no"
we had another event like that last weekend
I REMEMBER THAT
oh my god
And someone in the crowd asked "How much do you bench"
Oh my first impression of nicholas though, I think I first saw him when he went to speak in a JSA meeting
yea running start junior year was rough
first impression was that you were a bit of an oddball/loner, next was oh he's running start that makes sense, then wait that's nicholas's brother??
I'm pretty sure cards against humanity was involved
<@!503787499605458954> I forget when we first started hanging out in JSA
cube monster
Jarrett the power hungry cuber
doing a project with them rn actually
yeet
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/629566991551954958/675257564707029011/20200207_003140.jpg?width=329&height=657
lol. I do remember hanging out w you for the first time wintercon junior year though
yea, JSA does that
I also can't remember a specific first meeting w noah bc I'm 95% sure we crossed paths at least 50 times before I said a word to you
I can imagine you sitting in the hallways or outside on a bench cubing haha
Cube on campus?
Jarrett do you bring your cubes around still?
my main impression of jarrett in high school until fairly recently was that he was always messing around w a cube
I meant all of you
I saw yall around all the time, just never talked to yall
like I knew who y'all were just never was close till like junior/senior year
YEAH
ok see I feel like most of us have existed in this weird fuzzy bubble
everyone else was just kinda at the same school as me for like 7 years
I really only "met" Jiayi and Noah
I was awkward too, and I had the worst sense of humor freshman year 😂
That was such a fun class
that was a fun class though
it was doubly awkward bc kulz was super strict on the only-spanish rule
I was so fucking awkward back then yikes but yes I remember meeting you too
so I just stopped watching anything
cause I couldn't stand to finish "Heavens' Lost Property", and I couldn't watch a different show until I finished it
I know my first impressions of Cindy were positive, we met in spanish class freshman year
I don't remember my first impressions on most of you guys either
My friends here tell me I'm really easy to be around, which definitely gave me a big confidence boost when it comes to making friends
😦
Jarrett is a large part why I stopped watching anime
🙂
We definitely talked a lot about sakura trick, I remember that
then you graced me with the knowledge of it
I really don't remember my first impressions of most of you
I think i just found that one on my own
Or was it the other way around?
I just Jarrett and I mainly talked about anime when we first met haha, I think I got him into sakura trick
"damn them some nice anime tits"
Thanks guys
and like the chillest person ever it's kinda great
he's very approachable
gotta say though Jiayi really made the best first impression somehow
its just that I found her sweet side later
Definitely later on though, developed bad impressions of some
she is absolutely getting better
at least there aren't any more 30 year old men involved
Tbh I don't remember having a bad impression of anyone in early high school, maybe coming right out of middle school my standard for people was just super low haha
I can't tell if she's getting better or not
`~~I thought my~~ Cindy ~~was~~ is still absolutely mental
and you are kinda an ass but we love you for it
college has made it much better
I thought my Cindy was absolutely mental
she was/is weird
I thought Tina was flat out just weird
I thought Noah was kinda an ass when I first met him
that being said though thats not really a necessary feeling
Ashley was the first friend I made here
Helps that at the time I hadn't made any friends so I was pretty nervous and just wanted friends haha
ok that's really sweet
pretty sure i felt that way about Jiayi, Gene, and Alan
thats a platonic thing
agreement
`when I first sat down next to Ashley in class, she gave me a smile and I knew right away I wanted to be her friend`
can't relate tbh but that's fine
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I feel like a crush develops later down the line
But at that point it wasn't necessarily romantic, or a crush
Definitely a moment of instant attraction
I know when I first sat down next to Ashley in class, she gave me a smile and I knew right away I wanted to be her friend
well then you have a pretty simple goal
yeah p much
`idk like a lot of people talk about being nervous or fluttery around them and other cute shit. I don't really want to date her? idk how to describe my feelings lmao. but this is possibly the most instantly-attracted-to-someone I've ever been`
ah that sounds like your dick talking
So I'd say it's close enough
Replace 'be with' to 'be around' and it fits spot on
I'm pretty sure the only definition for having a crush is to have a really strong desire to be with someone you find very attractive
idk like a lot of people talk about being nervous or fluttery around them and other cute shit. I don't really want to date her? idk how to describe my feelings lmao. but this is possibly the most instantly-attracted-to-someone I've ever been
I'm realistic my guy and idk really what having a crush feels like but I feel like this ain't it
ah, this is a girl, well I'd try to figure out the straight part before getting too deep in your headspace
And I completely know how that feels haha, there's been a few people over here that just make me think "I really really really wanna be their friend"
That's awesome!
I'm 98% sure she's straight and honestly it's still more of a physical thing than anything else but I really wanna be her friend she seems really cool and a lot of fun
a few days ago I got introduced to someone through a good friend of mine who basically punched me in the face w how attractive they are I was like damn people like this exist in real life???
tea Imma expose myself I'm currently experiencing probably the closest thing I've felt to a "real crush"
aw that's sweet
She is a bit of a party-er which isn't really my type haha, but she's definitely one of the closer friends I've made over here
Really honest about what she likes and dislikes about people
She tells me her high school friend group was insanely high maintenance, so she's happy that our friend group is really laid back
She's really expressive and easy going
What's she like?
Yeah it's really not a big deal, for her it wasn't obsessive, now it's just something we laugh about haha
acknowledge the attractiveness, move on
Like it just happens what can you do
Or necessarily a bad thing
I've never had a crush on a teacher or prof but like I don't think it's that weird unless you're obsessive about it
and people wonder why teacher student porn is so common
-_-
👀
I mean I have to admit, our math professor was super hot
what's up with people crushing on professors?
Also in terms of romantic prospects, I found out my crush had a heavy crush on my math professor haha. Doesn't get much better than that
Yeah I agree with Noah, someone's gotta make the effort first
I still think that effort's super worth it though
in a perfect world both people ask each other out simultaneously, but the best you can really hope for in reality is that both people are working up the courage to ask and one of you just happens to reach that point first
So I totally feel
Probably more effort than they've put in to stay connected with me
Everyone's gotta put in an effort to stay connected, I've put in a lot of time to stay connected with my first semester friends going into this second semester (especially since they dorm on a different campus)
For clarification I was talking mostly about (established) friends w the 2 way street part
no fuck you
Really in high school I thought everything was so easy and simple in comparison, like 6 classes, clubs, sports and extracurriculars, maintaining a social life, finding my people, making a best friend, it all seemed to come so naturally
Then in college it's like 4 classes and life's like "fuck you bitch"
How ever the two way street part is very important to note, you shouldn't expect them to put forth a level of effort you wouldn't yourself. I've always liked the saying a relationship should consist of a 60/40 split, with both people trying to be the 60%, but that applies more to already established relationships. In this case don't expect someone to ask you out, you're at multiple disadvantages, one you're relying on them liking you in the first place, two you're need them to have the guts to ask you out, three you need to actually like them back. You need all three or it doesn't work in your case, you'd be much better off asking them out, as that fulfills two of the three, and all you need is for them to like you.
I'm not quite there yet with anyone over here
It takes even more effort to make anything that feels like a real connection
It takes a lot of effort to make friends haha, that's what I've found out in this first months of college
no
Oh was that all
`really helps to make the first move as far as romantic prospects go`
this is very true

`a lot of guys might not even consider the idea ("she's out of my league") unless you go after them yourself`
I don't know if I agree with this point exactly this way, I'd say it's more `Because my main insecurity in life is people not liking me or not paying attention to me`
most people are scared of asking people out due to rejection, and the humiliation of that rejection, it's possible that they are scared of asking you out because of `"she's out of my league"` but it's also very possible they are just scared of asking really anyone out, and it's less who *you* are and more who *they* are, basically the fear of rejection is a constant to them regardless of the person
Idk if anything I said was helpful rip but I hope so
BUT sending my love for whenever you read this Helen
I mean they were opinions at the end of the day. I feel like she went to sleep lol
Ooh spicy
and some opinions on Cindy's points
cause I do have some points to make
alright I'll be serious now
My point in bringing the last bit up is that people who have a lot of friends don't just magically procure them or attract them by doing nothing unless they're *exceptionally* physically attractive, in which case biology has already given them the spotlight. Everyone else has to create their own though
`too many askreddit threads`, quality source of information there
That's more of a first impressions thing though
Final note that if you want people to notice you and want to be your friend immediately you still have to put yourself out there in some way whether that's just talking a lot and engaging a lot in class or going to events alone or wearing something really flashy/unique
holy wall of text
I just looked over
This is turning into a huge ramble but basically I feel you but probably the best way to get that validation is still to take the first step most of the time?? And note that some people probably aren't interested in being more than acquaintances and that's ok and doesn't reflect badly on you
I get where you're coming from, I really do, and it makes me a lil sad bc you deserve way better, but honestly, life's not fair, and it really helps to make the first move as far as romantic prospects go. Tbh you're objectively pretty hot, smart and ambitious and seem put-together even when you're not necessarily, and a lot of guys might not even consider the idea ("she's out of my league") unless you go after them yourself (and a lot of guys are into girls who take initiative, source: too many askreddit threads). As for people taking interest in you in general, I'm honestly surprised to hear that you feel like they don't. All relationships are a two-way street, if they aren't putting in as much effort they probably aren't worth yours. But from my experience it also helps to put yourself out there a bit first in terms of opening up about yourself / talking about what you're passionate about etc, that should spark interest and conversation and if it doesn't they're also probably not worth your time. You can also always ask an acquaintance if they're free sometime and wanna get coffee or study together or smth. Idk especially if you're mostly friends w introverts you kinda have to get used to reaching out first in most contexts and it doesn't necessarily mean they're not interested in you as a person or friend, even if it might come off that way
It’s the greatest feeling in the world to be able to say hi to whoever you like instead of being awkward around everyone you’re not very familiar with
I think I have more acquaintances now than everyone I was ever friendly with in my life
Every day I walk around campus I can wave to multiple people
I think one social success I have had is the network of acquaintances I’ve developed
yes
Read the emoji as a word
i'm confused
... what's pretty
Okay ngl that's pretty :( but gimme a sec to figure out how to word my response
and the best way to do that is just ask
Oh yeah I also have a watch list for people who I want to be regular friends with
the biggest thing is just to get the ball rolling
people are bad at picking up hints
I guess it’s just that I spend so much effort paying attention to specific people (even just for normal friends) and trying to get close to them that I wish for someone to do the same for me
but that's not the type of people you're fishing for
and even some not single ones would still say yes
^
Tbh if you ask a guy point blank not many would say no if they're single
Lots of guys esp the awkward ones like to be approached by the girl
If you ask first it makes them pay attention to you
So I would like that to be proven wrong at some point
Because my main insecurity in life is people not liking me or not paying attention to me
that's a rather large barrier to entry
I think the other problem I have is I would like someone to ask me on a date first
They just checked off a reasonable number of boxes in my list of ideal traits, so I put them on a watchlist
I didn’t really have a crush on them
Wdym by not real crushes?
He is also a generic rather nerdy and socially awkward CS guy so I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt lol
Which this guy is not really exhibiting
Also if I’m going to ask out someone I don’t have a real crush on I feel like it would be better if they at least had a vague interest in being my friend
I should wait until Catalyst rush ends for that
Except for maybe one
The thing is, they’re not real crushes
If you're choosing to ignore ideal types and you've had several crushes why not ask them out?
But no dice
Of course I have an ideal type in my mind but I’m not rejecting anyone (not even as a friend) and I’m also choosing to ignore ideal types for now
I cast a pretty wide net
I try to talk to various people as much as I physically can
It’s not even that
You have very high standards/expectations though
I feel like that's not necessarily true
Which makes me sad sometimes but I try to not think about it too much
Also have no access to dating and romance in general
Not that I have access anyway
I currently have no interest in trying any other drugs
I have no interest in marijuana because it smells horrible
It's one of the things I have absolutely no desire to try
Interesting
I felt slightly less tired of social activity than I usually would have by that point
Didn’t feel much
Huh, what was it like
Tobacco because it was available
Sex is its own category
Sex counts in that category
Also aside from that one question literally nothing on the test is romance related
Also yeah why tobacco
Was fun for the most part also didn't turn into anything more for the most pasrt
Well I guess it depends what you count as "romantically", there was a lot of murky maybes before that tbh but I did go on a few dates
I thought we were talking about the size of something else
yes
ah
ring a bell?
she sent it like a day ago?
the whole thing about the bigs and littles not hooking up
also what do these mean?
`My list of prospective romantic interests is back to zero for the time being` what happened?
`what about your big ;)` uh?
why tobacco?
really?
But it wasn’t a cigarette
Tobacco
or both
tobacco or marijuana?
lol
A point for drinking, a point for smoking
I feel like that is a life experience on par with some of the points on the test
I should get a point off for eating a shit ton of 2x spicy ramen today
or the beastiality
is it crimes or drogas ;p
so
Whatever points I checked off during this school year are non-romance related
jkjk
what about your big ;)
well helen
My list of prospective romantic interests is back to zero for the time being
Congrats!!!
lol, really I'm surprised
lmao good work
by the way, I finally checked off "held hands romantically" lmfao
My score keeps changing
you heck off
Sometimes I check off some different things for whatever reason
i dont really  get in trouble with the law
64
which feels lower than it should be tbh
35
got bored, retook it in the library
How about the power hungry monster?
Mine probably hasn't changed
I feel like yours probably dropped more than mine tbh
Cindy you were 58
<@!233062637922025472> you were 73
you've dropped 5
Helen your old score was 95
oh that's lower than I thought it was
old was 61
wait that's yours right
woah
90
lmao
no fuck you
oh fuck you had a spreadsheet
but I can probably check
idr either
idr
what was it before?
wow
41
lmaoooo
I'll do it after I leave the library
i only dropped by one point since college began
everyone *go*
lol you should take it again
by the way I have no idea what my purity score is anymore
mood
... conceptually, I couldn't speak from experience
work life balance is important
and who knows the geniuses might be partying and hooking up on weekends
ok nerds is very different from geniuses
i was saying the rice purity score thing as an example
they're off doing their own thing at google or whatever
all the real tech geniuses are not in this group
^
low purity score doesnt mean they're not nerds
so?
we played a game of hot seat and my rice purity score is an extreme outlier
explain fakeness
?
there are no real nerds
fake nerds?
also the tech social networking group is full of fake nerds
but I'm gonna take it as a yes
that's not really an answer to the question
Well only one so far, to consolidate post-drama
We have “girls hangouts”
so are you saying your friends gossip a lot or a little?
it's hard to gossip about guys when there are few girls and very little spicy tea happening
maybe that's just my new friend group
I honestly feel like we don't gossip about guys that much
exposed
Alan
What?
we don't gossip about girls
Important question: do guys gossip about girls as much as girls gossip about guys?
on behalf of canada mr. pm I'm begging you to shave
oh dman
tbh trudeau has lost several points recently WHAT is that BEARD
he has a nice voice though
the bar is pretty low for world leaders
sometimes I think macron is attractive but most of the time not really
I think Macron is a runner up to Trudeau
obama's a good pick though
Alan knows his audience
nice
lol
lol
virgin
justin
virgin
modern era definitely justin trudeau sorry
we don't really know if the images we have are legit but I'd probably say cleopatra
dear god
;)
have you seen Obama in that beige suit
Ever
jkjkjkjk
young stalin
ever??
._.
Go
Most attractive world leader ever
yikes
obama bc he's still the only one under 70
Obama: so after you cum you can say, thanks Obama
best living president to bang
yeah but he's Dead
Seeing how hes not like 70
If we're talking strictly presidents id bang JFK first
personality?
and I still don't get why people thought he was that attractive
why does he look kind of like shawn mendes
leave a beautiful corpse
live fast, die fast
jfk, the one who got shot in the head?
who just banged everyone in it
`being president usually sucks`
except JFK
technically that's correct
"it's good for posture"
also also I just searched it up the oval office already has couches but knowing elon (assuming he was able to be pres) he'd still sleep on the floor
there's the official side and the residential side and sure it's their house but it's a farther walk than you're thinking
also the white house is fucking massive
being president usually sucks
yes
ah
when I say slept in the office I mean like collapsed on the desk
their bedroom is "down the hall"
the White House is their house
but not slept
fallen asleep sure
na
I feel like plenty of presidents have probably slept in the office during particularly busy times
oh right
L
so no presidency
do the white house staff try to buy him a couch to sleep on?
how does his lifestyle change
he's South African
like fr
does he sleep on the floor of the oval office
if he becomes pres
damn
wait
idk, once Tesla and SpaceX are well established, and he's looking for new projects
but I doubt it'll happen unless he specifically does it for the meme
that'd be hilarious
don't let your memes be dreams
who even knows the diff
meme the dream
dream the meme
just because
I want Elon Musk to run one day
his donations have been invaluable to the dem party and will continue to be, but like, genuinely, it's so annoying that he can do this lmao
and like I'm not one of the people who hates billionaires bc they're loaded
money money money
shhhh
I'd probably be a lot more ok w him if he didn't waffle around about whether he was gonna run for so long
it's infuriating that his candidacy has a plausible shot (however small that chance is) precisely because he's rich enough to not have to fundraise or develop a real grassroots network himself, and can bypass the FULL YEAR of working the campaign trail everyone else has done
everyone else had already been in the first four for months when he declared
he's mainly skipping early states bc he got in the game so late
well yeah but more specifically, using shitloads of money to blanket super tuesday states w fuckloads of tv ads and campaign extensively there way ahead of everyone else (who are following the traditional primary schedule - IA->NH->NV->SC->others)
L
"Bloomberg is polling in the high single digits (greater or equal to Buttigieg) nationally, but his strategy involves ~~skipping all early states~~ using money"
interesant
Bloomberg is polling in the high single digits (greater or equal to Buttigieg) nationally, but his strategy involves skipping all early states
that's fair
Yang was at ~5-6% on first alignment
that's more bc of the nature of the caucuses than a nonexistent base
mhm
if you're talking about the iowa results so far
rip yang at 1% tho
quality
huh bloomberg pollin in at 0%
https://tenor.com/view/surprised-pikachu-pokemon-shock-surprised-pikachu-gif-15357817
everyone else:
dnc: "here have a spot on the podium"
bloom: "here have 300k"
Lol
*interesting*
Old people
also the debate rule change for bloom was
Yeah
bloomberg's ads are swaying a lot more ppl than i expected ngl
The parallels to the 2016 GOP primary are a yikes
Those who are moderate but not Biden fans are overwhelmingly endorsing Bloomberg instead of Pete or Amy and it angers me
Lmao no ok I didn't have a huge issue w "The Establishment" like a lot of people in 2016 but. I feel like this primary has really hammered home how out of touch they are w the voting body
bloony just makes me think of bloon tower defense
But the votes would probably be split between Sanders/Warren/Pete/Amy
bloony lmao
Lol my fear w Biden dropping out is that the dem establishment would probably consolidate around Bloony
sorry sorry
*maximum chaoooooos*
If that holds in November Trump wins
The scariest thing to come out of Iowa though is that turnout matches 2016 aka quite low
Contested convention is a real possibility though which could be super interesting to see
Not gonna happen but I can dream
Kinda want Biden to drop out for the Maximum Chaos scenario
Love that keep it coming
Very tight race between Sanders and Buttigieg w Buttigieg ahead in delegates (so far Pete's internal data has been much more accurate than Bernie's. within one % point), media coverage focusing heavily on Biden sucking, #mayorcheat trending on Twitter bc of salty Bernie stans lol
I'm offended
I feel like you both ignored my joke on purpose
that's fair
Warren imo is doing better than expected
he's 77, give the guy some slack on his performance
warren and biden fell off hard
buttigeg is popping off yeah
So far I am correct
**also biden almost certainly underperformed
aight I'm popping in one last time for the night to say my bets are on mayor pete taking iowa and bernie supporters throwing a fit over rigged results tomorrow
`the Iowa Democratic Party is saying they will not report results any time tonight — instead they will release results “sometime Tuesday.”` I hate everyone lol
it's. A Strategy, to be sure. a good one? idk
Buttigieg claiming victory despite nothing being released
or attempting to, anyways
had a bad feeling from the moment IA dems announced they'd be using an app to report
I'm gonna scream of course it's "technical difficulties"
I feel like Seattle is very much Warren country
who are y'all supporting? if you know
anyways for someone so invested in the primary I'm still pretty undecided lmao
so Bloomberg skipping early states and being completely excluded from that media narrative................ highly doubt that's gonna work out for him
what I was typing earlier - Biden is probably the only candidate who can maybe come back from shitty performances in the first two states, and honestly from early reporting (though we still don't have the damn NUMBERS) it's looking like he's having a shitty night in IA, so his nom chances might decrease significantly by tomorrow
really? huh I thought mine were weirdos
same
my parents like Bloomy lmao
oh interesting
my cousin is actually the chief of staff for his personal hedge fund
I really want to know her take on it, but she visited us a little while before he announced his campaign, so I probably won't see her for a while
he's still really unlikely to win the nom
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
so I don't have a ton to say about him, and he only started gaining any polling traction / relevance very recently. I will say it kinda pisses me off that his strategy of dumping fuckloads of cash into tv ads may actually be working but
Bloomberg may be the candidate whose actual platform I am least familiar with as of this instant
btw I know I'm spewing a lot of Politics lol but y'all are entitled to your own opinions I don't judge
what about Bloomberg?
he's a fantastic speaker, imo probably the best in the field, which is very compelling. I just think.... he's a little Too inexperienced. going from mayor of a college town to pres is a big jump and imo his campaign feels a bit premature. if he had more Legit Accomplishments under his belt I'd feel much more comfortable supporting him. also, history w race issues isn't great, and if we're really honest, I think his sexuality is a turnout problem waiting to happen. which is p depressing.
Buttigieg is another guy I have weird feelings about
I also like Klobuchar, even though I didn't think I would at first
agreed
I have a bigger problem w their age than I do w their whiteness tbh
cool
... L
*think*
I think he is joking
"I wish all of politics was white people"
in response to be joking about Cindy's comment
he wishes me to share his deep insights
talking about this with Mark right now
I do like Yang, but mostly I just wish the field wasn't dominated by white people over 70
maybe I'm an outlier here but I wasn't too thrilled about any of the candidates despite a really interesting and diverse field. initially I liked Kamala (side note I still think she's the best vp pick for Biden by a long shot) but she had a kinda messy campaign (sister was the manager, apparently clashed with a lot of staff, overall didn't do a great job of positioning self on field strategically)
who do you wish ran then?
Yang?
but then I also wish sanders and warren didn't run
I really wish he didn't run
sigh
`Biden is problematic because [he] says some dumbass shit literally every time he's on stage`
I think Biden's heart is in the right place, but that's about it
among other things
i really think this was enough for me to not back biden
https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-on-video-games-2020-1
my god, the lack of results so far is physically painful
`Pro tip: If you have ever wanted to be the most popular person in the room, try being an undecided voter in an Iowa caucus. For 15 glorious minutes, you’ll be the belle of the ball.` lmfao
So idk
But it is
Between Sanders and Biden if electability wasn't a question I'd back Biden
If the nomination wasn't a question I'd back Yang
I actually think Sanders might have a better shot in the general
So idk who I want to win at this point
Trump also has a lot of fodder to use against him even if it's completely false i.e. all the burisma shit
Biden is problematic because he's fucking boring, says some dumbass shit literally every time he's on stage, and really doesn't inspire any enthusiasm
He did seem like a genuinely nice dude when I met him in 2017 but that was like a 5 min interaction lol
Of course the truth is probably somewhere in between but im surprised he's gained such a loyal backing while revealing so little of his real self (wasn't that a big criticism of Hillary? he almost never talks about his personal life)
Also I'm not sure what to believe on what he's actually like, supporters paint him out to be this virtuous patron saint of progressivism, others see him as a petulant populist who boosted trump to victory in 2016
On the other hand, he has a pretty shit record for actually accomplishing things in the Senate, I fundamentally disagree w a lot of his politics, you can bet your ass his election would spur Major right-wing backlash, his grand plans are incredibly unrealistic, his supporters freak me out w how cultish they are, and he's particularly weak on foreign policy which y'all know I particularly care about
I have weird feelings about Bernie like on one hand I do respect a guy who has been saying the same shit for like 60 years
I have a lot of problems with them both but I think Biden's a more pragmatic choice for sure
Against Sanders? I don't think that's that surprising
i'm surprised that you'd back biden
And results just started rolling in like a few mins ago
By this time in 2012 Obama was already declared the winner
Also suspect that it's gonna go into the night
I will probably keep spamming this channel w my thoughts as things progress 2020 is shaping up to be a very interesting year to say the least
Anyways this is probably the most wide-open race in modern primary history
I have REALLY mixed feelings about both Sanders and Biden but if I had to pick I'd prob go w Biden
(aside from them Buttigieg is most likely to win but his national numbers are quite low, don't think he has a real shot at the nom anymore unfortunately)
(still unlikely)
Idk I feel like it's honestly mostly a 2 person race now w Sanders and Biden but if someone who's not them wins Iowa that could change
that too lol
VERY surprised at how well Klobuchar is doing so far
damn pete w/ the early "lead"
...L
Ok it's still very early but I'm shook that all 5 have a shot at delegates
anyone else watching the iowa caucus??
And I saw a lot of reluctant-defense takes
True
But that there are two Kansas Citys
It's dumb as hell that not only is Kansas city not in Kansas
In all fairness to the guy
Though it was kinda gratifying to see some vancouverites sporting seahawks gear
I didn't even realize it was the super bowl till like half an hour ago lol
Oh?
lol so that's why my friends were debating kansas city today
lmao rip
Yikes
O:
First universal palindrome in 909 years
02022020
Today’s date is a palindrome
you're right
lol
create a more *just* and *righteous* world where people can *coexist* and live in *harmony*
idealism
isn't that what the marketing gimmick of polisci is
idk like I don't wanna have a big head and it sounds like I think I'm better than everyone (I'm really not) but I'm surprised by how idealistic a lot of polisci students are like that's literally not how policymaking works
for reference, the stage beyond that contains the acceptance of pedophilia as part of the LGBTQ+ community
"everyone is legal" falls under the level of acceptance of "hippie bullshit"
Well I guess it’s kinda mean to say other people have no logic, but you know what I mean
I am frequently frustrated by other people’s lack of logic so I am not surprised when I disagree with the majority of people on something
lots of engineers are terrible at art
completely justified
not to be mean but I think lots of arts students are not good at logic
lmaooo
I think lots of people are not good at logic
anarchy
aka
is everyone is legal then it destroys the point of having legality in the first place
no not everyone is legal
hence the "am I just an asshole" line of questioning
and we talked about it today in class and I was really surprised by how many people strongly agreed w their ideas
this is a huge oversimplification
and I went through what they advocate and I was kinda just like
**I brought this up bc yesterday for my arts studies class we went to a lecture from the no one is illegal organization lol
which of course I already knew but I kinda feel like it's a mostly-unsolvable problem
Lol
I guess my conclusion from all of this is just "well life ain't fair"
She lives the floor above me
Ahem sascha Seinfeld
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
like if anything it's less fair that some people will just be the kids of billionaires than it is that some people won't be able to legally migrate
where and to whom you're born is never going to be fair
at the same time, while I was typing some of my thoughts out
in that it's incredibly unjust, as it stands
but they have a Point
like obviously I don't agree w the ultra-liberal policy solutions i.e. open borders is a recipe for disaster
which will happen over time
I guess the natural solution is just to develop poor economies
but what can you really do about that
like it really isn't fair that corporations in the global north profit off of the exploitation of illegal migrant workers
1. doesn't have the coronovirus
ideally, what *should* be the case?
but then it becomes a normative question
empirically that'd be a dumb policy
my gut reaction to "no one is illegal" is "that's dumb"
Do you think you do or don’t agree with the mentality?
but I wonder if I agree w the mentality
bc it's not realistic
yes I agree
I just think that letting everyone inherently be legal to go anywhere is also not the solution
i.e. my parents escaped china w basically nothing, but to come to canada and then the US they leaned heavily on my aunt julia (dad's sister) who a) knew english well b) already lived here and c) paid a ton of money to get the legal work done
I don’t disagree that our legal immigration system is not great
legal immigration requires a lot of resources your average poor migrant won't have
plenty of illegal immigrants are productive residents who will never attain citizenship
but perhaps our resident dual citizen might be able to shed some light
but I have nothing to disparage your claim with
I would disagree
If you move somewhere and you’re a productive resident you can get citizenship after a while
Most people have that ability in most situations
for what reasons?
which ones would be the most popular
what if you got to choose which government to become a citizen of
it would be an interesting take on human society
I think the consequences should matter more than the theory/idealism
but also realistically allowing everyone to move anywhere would be an absolute nightmare
you're gonna have to be more specific than that
I feel like this is related to globalization
globalization?
like why should some people have privilege based on where they were born while others don't
the idea is like technically we're all migrants so everyone should have freedom of movement
I dont think its a human right to just enter whatever country you feel like, whenever you feel like
I think they often mix up freedom with human rights
but yeah so many people believe in it that I'm starting to question myself
it's more "bc human rights"
"because freedom" I think is the wrong listed motive, that's more of a conservative thing i.e. "I should have guns bc freedom"
Unfortunately a lot of people believe in it
I think the ultra-liberal stance of basically anyone can do anything they want because freedom is pretty dangerous
Some people just dont have good intentions
No you’re definitely not
same but I wonder a lot if I'm just an ass for thinking that
Hmm I’d also disagree with that
Oh lol
no more in the context of immigration lol
Hard disagree
Like pedophilia and stuff?
do y'all agree w the idea that "no one is illegal"
About 50/50
Both
Leave as in switch dorms or leave as in drop out??
Lmaoooo
Did I mention we only have like ~25 people on our floor
I generally have daily conversations with our RA about shit that happens
One guy left after the police showed up
Mostly people that get reported one too many times then decided to leave
Also our floor has lost a lot of people
Making fun of the guy I caught flexing in the bathroom mirror at 5am with an aluminum baseball bat that always leaves the bathroom a mess. Going through the trash of the person dumping in our lounge, finding their access center form for an assignment extension and reporting them, the leaving passive aggressive notes on our sticky note board about it while taking every chance to say hi to them when I run into them. Generally just swearing at the people that can't figure out how to flush a god damn toilet to save their life (bruh you do it every time). Currently need to find out who is sticking the toilet plunger into the toilets upside down
Ooh what'd you do
Mostly tormenting the asshats that keep trashing our floor
Mmhh, it's good
But when I get a chance to be a dick for the right cause
So I'm not most of the time
I just don't think it's right
I find it incredibly fun and liberating
I love being a dick
I talked with Mark about this recently
It's ok though
I used to push back on that but honestly you are usually right you're just a dick about it sometimes
I generally am
But no you are correct
I thought you were gonna say existence or smth
Lol
The socioeconomic one
It's ok we all won the only really important lottery in life
True
At least you got working knees
:[
And it's not like because you're fat and I'm muscle, it's just I'm a guy and you're not
Also the unfairness of life, I'm ~8% heavier than you but 50-100% stronger
It's a joke
Oh?
Nice timing
You're right I'm 115-120
A very skinny 6' person is basically my weight
And very skinny
Yea but he's close to my height
<@503787499605458954> check your weight
Well actually no
Jiayi
It would be kinda worring if I was drastically heavier than any of you
Which would make sense seeing as you all have at least 5" on me
He's here now
O shit Fran
I'm pretty sure, Salina, Helen, Fran, and you are all heavier
I weigh 130-135
And I'm not exactly about to be sumo wrestling
Yeah but I think I'm the only person that weighs more than you
Which isn't huge
So I'm only like 10-15lbs heavier
Although, Cindy is basically exactly my height and she's 120?
Salina is 5" taller than me and weighs ~the same
Yea that is probably true
I weigh the most
Of all of us
And that
We'll note that you're probably the densest person here
`Noah is the most jacked`
`yea but I weigh less than a lot of people`
and become one with the world
and become one with the smash
ascend my child
smash is beautiful
and in that way
and combine them into something only you can create
all of their desires
all of their hopes
all of their memories
all of their loves
all of their fears
for the art of smash is to become your opponent
if one's soul cannot take the molding required for my craft, it does not deserve to be within my hands
souls that reflect the truest reflections of my opponents wants and desires
I wish to create beautiful souls
souls which are crushed under the hands of Smash are souls unworthy of creative talents
"just their will and desire to live"
I am not here to crush souls
and they hold the same of you
you hold the very manifestation of your opponent in your hands
so you're just here to crush ppl
for when your hands pick up a controller
... L
seeing who can mold the other's into something more beautiful once the game ends
to play Smash is to play with the soul and mind of your opponent
for what is Smash without Heart
it is my duty as a respected member of the community to test the willpower of anyone claiming to be a Smasher
making friends was never my intention
Isn’t that the whole point of a competitive game?
Not everyone in smash is your best friend
oh no
target sighted
👁️ 👁️
Someone mentioned smash once
any of em play smash
ooh nice
I made some friends with upperclassmen RAs
aww
No I just stopped
are you gonna be playing secret hitler for five hours?
I’ve been playing secret hitler for four hours
go sleep bub
Fuck it’s past midnight
I’m fine with switching with <@!478706068223164416> , he’s been working out as far as I can tell so I’ll appreciate the strength boost
we're talking ten zombies here, overpowering more than two at a time would require linebacker type strength
well if you're bigger you're easier to spot, easier to grab onto
being larger would be better cause you can overpower zombies better
no
what?
zombies would prefer larger people
it is
yes
isn't that a boon though
`Noah is the most jacked`
yea but I weigh less than a lot of people
weak wrists in a melee situation can mean I'm more susceptible to parries and blocks
*not the weak wrists*
oh noooo
in a combat scenario, you'd be dealing with nearsightedness and weak wrists on my body's behalf
what would be the benefits and drawbacks
so what im hearing is that ideally i go into your body Alan
it takes literal hours for someone to adjust to seeing through a new pair of glasses, but since my prescription isn't terrible (-5.00 at most) she'd at least be able to make out medium to large objects
one detriment for someone switching to my body is that I wear glasses
I would choose <@!472541429130854421>, she and I are the same height so it would lower the barrier of body adaptation
strength isn't all about mass, it's also about how well your brain can control your muscles too
and that you'd have to learn how to use Noah's body
you also have to consider that Noah would also inherit your body
but in all fairness that can be a bonus if you decide to use him as bait and high tail it
Noah is the karate kid
weak knees though
I'd love to be inside that man
so Noah
Noah is the most jacked
keeping in mind that in switching bodies, the only thing you preserve about yourself is your personality and memories
**which friend would you choose to fight with**
except you've switched bodies
you and one of your friends find yourselves stranded in a room with weapons and 10 zombies
more hypotheticals
I cant believe that someone in 2020 would seriously run on "no malarkey!"
I do find it kinda funny we're gonna have two super old guys running that couldn't embody being old differently
By nature of the caucus I think it's gonna be an elimination game, and I think Sanders will probably absorb most of Warren's support
Because you also referred to Iowa in the same sentence
Which I also think is true
That's what's confused me
If I was talking about Iowa specifically I would've said he's gonna win the caucus
Ah
When I say dem primary I mean the overall dem primary lol
I did too
I meant "I think Sanders is gonna be the democratic nominee to run agaisnt trump"
This might change and idk how I feel about it but man Biden generates zero enthusiasm. I just can't see him carrying the vote if Sanders wins the first two states, and he's now leading in both
Ah
^
just a major caucus
Iowa caucus
no
No
Wait the "final" nomination is in 4 days?
That's what I just said
I honestly think Sanders is gonna get the nomination
My prediction right now 4 days from Iowa is that Sanders is going to win the dem primary
The dream

pardon the lang
a pussy ass bitch move
this is what we call
that's fair
I'm done I hate people
I-
Instead of testifying
He's. Fucking selling a book about the Ukraine scandal
the allegations are interesting for sure
what about bolton?
Lmao fuck John Bolton
I'm p sure we have the biggest Chinese population of any Western city
I'm genuinely shocked that it hasn't come to van yet, though chances are it has and just hasn't been confirmed
Rip
<@!503787499605458954>
There’s a confirmed coronavirus case in Toronto
Well
No lol it was the brain
Spines?
I’ve heard of this but idr
Uh
Trivia???
I honestly forget how old my sis is all the time
well, they're turning 48
my parents are 48
lol
she's gonna be 24
so she's 24?
holy shit
...
it's my sister's year
really? lol
reason why we can't have a cat
it's my parents' zodiac year
indeed
and more likely to be skinned by 12th grade bio classes
well don't call them mice bc they're not they're larger, meaner and smarter
year of the refined rodent
rood
respect our rodent overlords
year of the dirty fucking rat, you mean
year of the mouse all the way
good good
Fine maybe I should read Chinese zodiacs instead
Oops forgot it was Chinese New Year
heresy
horoscopes? on chinese new year?
There’s this really neat app called Co—Star which explains all your star signs
Today I’ve been spending a lot of time on horoscopes and Stardew Valley
lmao
show up
What do you even do for it?
Lol I keep forgetting jury duty exists
to confirm an option you have to go online and give an official response
"LEAVE ME ALONE"
"YES I HAVE ETHICAL QUALMS ABOUT PEOPLES CHICKEN SQUABBLES"
3) try to dequalify yourself
2) push it back for up to a year (what I did)
1) go to jury duty on the date specified
and you have three options
"JURY DUTY SUMMONS"
you get a big envelope in the mail that says
you mind your own damn business
i've yet to be summoned
idk
how does it actually work
*18 year olds*
damn I feel like I know way too many people who have already been summoned
cause last time I was snowed in
my jury duty is coming up again I know
yea
must be nice to have schedule flexibility
ah
3) whatever else is available
2) data structures
1) math 126
seeing as the classes I'll need to take are
it's probably not gonna be that huge of a deal any more
i can do it for you if you want
well that's less funny
oh
ON THE SAME DAY CLASS REGISTRATION OPENS
ahahahaha
I got summoned for jury duty
LIVID
am
I
this is a degeneracy free zone
I thought Anime won Taiwan's election because people wanted to bang waifus
Oh lmao
What
and I thought that Anime and Hong Kong people won Taiwan's election based on attractiveness
I read the second sentence and then the video
https://youtu.be/pYg626PQyOA
Anyways I actually came here to post this bc it made me smile
It's asking who they found most attractive not who they would want to bang necessarily
Idk I think it makes sense
how do you guys think it should look then?
hmm
Very close to still being a kid
20 is like
But still
It was asking what faces they found the most attractive
I think this survey wasn’t asking what age of women the men would actually date
I'd have a few choice words to say
Like damn if my dad married a 20 year old
That's creepy af
20 is like our age
Why would somone at the age of 50 prefer someone that's 20
As a person who is almost 20
Thinking about this graphic that Helen sent a while back
i'm awake and i have a headache
honestly thanks for a fantastic conversation that was a lot of fun
lmaoooo
fucks sake you really are like my nagging wife aren't you
you shut up
shut up bot not you
what do you mean by sentient?
the moment I start theorizing a way to create sentient Waifus is when I think I've hit my limit
I think I should stop
........
if done correctly it'll be no different than a regular wife, just that she lives forever
why not just build myself an immortal wife
and now that I'm thinking about it
so limitations of the mind are theoretically solvable with infinite time
infinite time means infinite problem solving space
because why the hell not
hell go watch your favorite movie of the last millennia for the first time a few thousand times
then go make fresh ones
delete them
backup your memories to the cloud
replacing the cortex of your brain for instance
but you'd also have the time to find a way to make them not feel the same
true
like everything would start to feel the same
I don't think you'd run out of things to do but I think you'd eventually get bored of Everything
I'm still in Sammamish right now
haha yeah
therefore, I theorize that running out of things to do until the death of the universe wouldn't be a problem
oh fuck I totally forgot y'all have tomorrow off
math would back me up but it's currently on break until Tuesday
nearly endless possibility space for experiences
and therefore
in sheer scope, it may seem like an eternity, but in those few quadrillion years there will be trillions of humans, trillions of other species, trillions of other planets
big ballpark estimate but stay with me
let's estimate the life of the universe to be a few quadrillion years
there would be things I didn't get to in that amount of time
or in other words
I don't think I would run out of things to do in that time
if my lifetime was the lifetime of the universe
the other thing I wanted to mention was
anyways
rules are now in our hands
living past the life of the universe means we've already broken the laws of physics
ehhh
look if you and I had a few infinite number of years to think of a way to develop powers of creations I'm sure we could think of something
and die
I would give my immortality to a mortal
and since I now exist outside the limitations of the universe
well you'd just exist, no one said anything about powers of creation
start a new Universe
yeah so I guess I'd become God
that's what I leave it at
probably huger than I could possibly imagine
I understand it's of huge importance
(idk if you know or care at all about lord of the rings but if you don't you should bc it's p much The Basis for all modern fantasy)
like for example elrond and his twin elros were half-elves and got to choose whether to be mortal or immortal, they chose differently, elrond has to watch his brother age and die, but like you said earlier, he also gets to see his line carry on throughout history (aragorn is actually a distant descendant of elros)
`it would be sad but in an ironic twist of things I think that's what would make developing those relationships so meaningufl` also not to nerd out even More but that is pretty much the thesis of tolkein's elf/mortal relationships
if you exist outside the limitations of the universe you're officially a God
I think that's it though
LOL
do I become God?
how would you exist when the world ceases to exist
consciousness in the void of nothing?
uh
what would life beyond the universe's death even look like
(if you live past the life of the universe I'll pass thanks)
I'm imagining you live until the universe dies
I've been describing immortality but what I'm imagining isn't you literally live forever
it would be sad but in an ironic twist of things I think that's what would make developing those relationships so meaningufl
in jirt's legendarium, men/humans were eru/god's favorites, and so he gifted them with death
lol
I mean I just came out of a lotr reread, I've been picturing tolkein's elves this entire time lmfao
I feel like this is some teen novelist's main plotline
I think you'd start wishing you could die
the idea of everyone around you dying over and over again just seems incredibly bleak
I think you'd start to go crazy after a few thousand years
I think it'd be kinda magical to live through so many lifetimes, and a big plus is that I wouldn't lose the value of time. I think I'd cherish every mortal relationship. but I also think I'd be a lot less likely to take offered immortality if I knew I was the only one
"hey, he still has my eyebrows, lol"
just kinda living
and it would be kinda cool to see your great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandson
but you also make new ones
sure, your family and friends die
you'd get to partake in many different iterations of human society
I think it would be positive
I can't decide if it's a positive or negative to be the only immortal
no
is it strange that immortality seems less appealing if I'm not the only one with it?
I guess for me it also depends if other people also have immortality
don't get bored but this time forever
or in other words
life would become a never ending struggling to find more things to live out
knowing that someday I will no longer exist doesn't scare me, but it does lend a sort of weight to every second when I acknowledge that
that's pretty much my exact line of thought
time starts to lose its meaning, doesn't it?
if you think about time as a valuable resource, and you suddenly have a near infinite amount of it
that kind of idea
what's the point of working when you have an infinite amount of money in your bank?
but I feel like a little bit of meaning would be lost
so I guess it depends
I wouldn't be opposed to significantly extending my life, and like you said, that can lead you down a different perception of age etc
like, if immortality became the societal norm, idk if I'd be the one person who chooses to die
I believe meaning in life is found in living it
but certain things give me pause to outright saying no I would never take it
I guess I believe that life is only meaningful if it ends
my gut reaction to the offer of immortality is actually to turn it down
I'm pretty fricken young right now aren't I
well
and if that lifetime is The Age of The Universe
I'm guessing that I'll start to perceive my lifetime relative to my current age
if I'm 3000, an extension to 10,000 sounds great
if I'm 250, an extension to 1000 sounds great
so if I'm 19, an extension to 300 sounds great
so my theory is that given immortality, I will be as Tired at life as I am right now as I will be in 250 years
lol
idk! at this exact moment, 10:59 on 1/19/2020, not very
how tired are you right now
depends on how Tired I am at that point
unsure
would you say yes?
I ask you if you wanna extend your lifetime to 1000 years
now imagine you've lived for 250 years
okay
yeah probably
hm
lol
you just die suddenly
so at 300
I guess so
to the aging
so no
imagine the same properties as immortality
would I age?
given that you'd be healthy throughout it
if I asked you if you wanted to live for 300 years would you say yes
better way of saying that
interesting
sure
if immortality was an option would you take it?
I agree that what you laid out is the most likely way this could happen, but like, ideally you'd just want your cells to stop aging
what t hen
problem occurs when you get to the brain
yeah that's a huge turnoff
frankenstein-esqe
it would
would require a lot of surgery though
a new arm or a new leg
like a new bone here or there
you could potentially do just parts
I looked at it from the body scale
it depends on the scale that you look at regrowing the parts
though obviously much harder to achieve
ideally you'd just be young forever
bc you have to repeatedly go through the process of aging and transferring into a new body
that's kind of an unsatisfying solution though
the most simple way I can think of this going is growing a new body of myself using my DNA and brain transplant when I hit an age where stuff starts breaking
what I really want done in my lifetime is a solution to aging
hell we're already doing genetic modifications on fetuses
same
I'm surprised it hasn't come much faster
I feel like Actual Pregnancy is gonna become a thing of the past relatively soon
moving towards Reproducing Life
and in terms of that stage, we're on Simulating Life right now
but first comes Replicating Life
to Solve Life
that'd probably be the greatest engineering feat of all time
the thing that freaks me out is the potential for brainwashing / thought surveillance
I'm actually kinda sad I won't be around to see it
it would probably just be our next step of evolution, except this time we're the ones who creatd it
yeah I'm not opposed to the idea
ah ok
"is that a bad thing"
wait ok was the `no not at all` in response to "is that a bad thing?" or "maybe I'd be fine with it"
we could just all die from an asteriod
but this is some endgame species bullshit
we would be able to reproduce infinitely (to the extent of the universe) and live forever (probably)
if we get to this point we've essentially solved the game of life
but then you're getting into societal issues on superhuman with human origin vs. synthesized superhuman
really?
then no not at all
if we somehow take existing humans and "upgrade" their species into superhumans
so maybe I'd be fine with it
but I'd be in the form of a robot
maybe I would be
or
I won't be around for that
heh
in your opinion, is that a bad thing?
if left unattended
we would literally take on the role of God and create a species that is originally derived from us but then evolved into its own superior species
people undergo surgery even when it's hecking dangerous
but then the idea of humans is kind of lost
have you seen some of the extreme plastic surgery cases
100%
all the way
honestly
I'm p sure I've discussed this at like a pretty surface level w noah at some point
ok more speculation time, assuming humans don't self-destruct / continue to exist as a species indefinitely, how far do you think we'll go in terms of cybernetic enhancements?
#freud #coke #psychoanalysis
I mean the brain handles it more elegantly than making you intentionally hit a button
okay but human judgment is kinda shite
`just repress them until needed
`
tap this button on your phone to remember that one time you got shitfaced drunk and skinny dipped in a swamp
I could probably program a way to do that
what if I don't want to fully delete them but just repress them until needed
you would be basically replacing your memories with a hard drive
I mean you could also choose to delete memories you find unpleasant
idk I feel like that'd kinda suck
so that you NEVER FORGET ANYTHING EVER
what if you could replace your entire cortex
also I think it'll still be a long time before we can genuinely simulate the brain
one sec lemme get my notes
loss of Self, I guess
why not replace the entire thing
why stop at just chips
can't wait till we all have chips embedded in our brains
then the development of Thinking in a faster, more efficient way is terrifying to think about
if you view the process of technology as the development of doing things in more efficient, faster ways
where we create technology to speed up the process of THINKING
I think the next age will be the AI age
actually before that happens
lol
but also the moment one of these companies realizes there aren't taxes if you own the country you operate in, I think that's when the next age of humanity will probably start
it kinda is yeah
it's pretty wild
like. all of those companies are american
do you ever stop and think about the sheer fucking cultural capital / control the US holds over the world
I should've put it as an honourable mention
I also vote it probably disney's smartest movie
anyways wall-e is my top animated movie of all time
look we're just trying to figure out under what circumstances the company Buy-N-Large is conceived
jeff bezos alone could probably buy a bunch of countries if he wanted to / it was legal / he wouldn't get assassinated for it
just maybe
maybe
"might"??
they might just be able to do it
and decided "let's take over the world"
some unholy NATechO
Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon
comprised of all the tech companies in the world that have become essential for society
a literal Tech Giant
one sort of communist nightmare
wdym?
but if they all came together
on their Own
and amazon owns like half the internet
imagine a world without google??
disagree
okay maybe Apple
but neither have enough influence right now that if they went down they'd have major impacts on society
or apple, or facebook
I'd put bets on Google or Amazon
of the big tech companies they're one of the least hell-bent on infiltrating every aspect of your life
honestly it wouldn't be microsoft though
FUCK
AHAHAHA
LMAO
lol the first movie that comes to mind on a similar concept is actually WALL-E
wait wouldn't this just be the prequel to Wall-E?
great now I want a sci-fi movie on this
I guess it'd be cool to take a Microsoft shuttle to Japan
unless another revolution happens
it just seems like that'd be the realistic path of progression for our current capitalistic society
I dunno
hmmm
is that weird?
yeah
it could actually happen
so you're telling me
actually it's a big ongoing debate in IR if states are losing relevance/importance in global politics
though in many cases, multinational corporations (mncs) are more powerful than states
not yet
is that a thing?
then becoming... a private government?
the only way I see it happening is through an international private company gaining a majority of the control over multiple nations
it's gonna be microsoft
yeah, which is why I think the idea of a unified earth is a lot more sinister than most people think at first glance
none of this hierarchical bullshit I'm coming up with
so literally One Organization
I'm picturing a huge, sprawling bureaucratic system. lots of surveillance. erasure of a lot of cultural nuance. likely some form of socialist dictatorship, one person/family/oligarchy at the center
but the top government by that point would be so abstract and detached it would serve no purpose other than its name
mine was more of a one government governs many governments governing many other governments
one single governing body over the whole planet wasn't even in my original plan
`if someone wanted to conquer and unify the earth it would 100% not be a democracy`
you now rule the world
then all bets are off the table
you somehow gain control over 100% of the earth's energy making resources
unless
defeating the point of its own existence is the more likely of the two
it would crumble under its own scope or it would defeat the point of its own existence
that's what you're missing
nah if someone wanted to conquer and unify the earth it would 100% not be a democracy
but if some nutcase actually wanted to try doing something like this, this is how I think it would turn out
I totally agreed that it's not realistic even in the slightest context
WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT of my/salina's argument that it's not realistic
ok the problem I have with what you're laying out is that it completely defeats the purpose of a one world gov lol. I get that you're trying to articulate what would be realistic but you are literally just describing a very-slightly more inclusive UN, which is explicitly not designed to be a Government government
and undermines the total globalization aspect
so it defeats the point of having a unified group at all
because if there's no consequences or benefits to a member of the group, it's basically as if they're not in the group at all
isn't that every dictatorship?? lol
yes
if you try doing something without the input of everyone then are you really governing everyone then?
the impossibility of trying to get the input of all members of such a group to carry out an action with actual meaning blocks it from doing anything useful
change its name?
...
it would have to power to
or whatever you wanted to try
but this exact vagueness in definition is what a governing body of this size would need to actually govern "the entire earth"
eh I've moved on
so idk if that's what you're looking for
anyways NATO and the Warsaw Pact were/are (nato still exists obviously) primarily military alliances
so this theoretical Humans of Earth group would need to include 1) everyone in the UN and 2) everyone not in the UN
it existed for a while (and actually did solve some minor conflicts!) in the interwar period
sorry doran
it has been too long
FUCK
league of nations was basically the failed precursor to the UN
fuck
league of nations was wwi wasn't it
also I believe you're talking about NATO and the Warsaw Pact
one of which is a religious entity of negligible real geopolitical importance that should probably stay out of it
so all but 2 recognized states in the world are already in the UN
`193 countries are UN members. The exceptions are Taiwan (in 1971, the UN ousted Taiwan and replaced it with the People's Republic of China) and Vatican City. Kosovo is not yet a member.`
(I dunno man it's been two years since IB history)
(were those two the right ones)
imagine, basically, if there was a larger group that umbrella'd the League of Nations and the Warsaw Pact alliances under one roof
the final group would be a group of the UN and whatever countries aren't in the UN in another group
if the UN is a group of groups
Ttyl 💕
the most realistic way for such a group to exist is for it to be the supergroup of the UN
okay bye i'm gonna go back to reviewing how dna works
and
and
I do
UN-derstanding of it
you could say he's got a real
I hope you realize that
ouch
Alan you're basically describing the UN
back in the old days, student debt and crushing social pressure didn't have to make every one its bitch
so my theory for an International Human Alliance would have to satisfy three points:
- Extremely vague in description
- Basically useless in terms of administrative power
- Needs a reason to exist
I'm not sure if more of us are actually depressed or if more of us are just honest about it
I mean yeah there's a bunch of studies about how younger people feel more isolated
#socialawareness?
I'm having a completely different conversation here but I've got too much momentum to stop so I'll keep going
i'm not saying it's necessarily rock solid truth, but i think there are some trends that seem to support that ok boomer smack talk about the new gens
in a group sense
Idk about the social media makes us less social thing I feel like I would be equally antisocial when if it didn't exist at all
humans suck at agreeing with other humans
i think it contributes to a lot of negativity
but
which should be a net positive
there's effectively less excuses to put effort into a relationship
Anyways fair enough Salina
I never watched the whole thing but I understand that basically the exact situation I outlined is part of the premise lol
Example: Star Trek
just a possible situation
because there's no point in having an "Earth Fan Club" if the club has no administrative purpose other than Keeping Us Together because What Are We Uniting Against/For?
*not saying this is me*
WHY YOU NO RESPOND
I SEE YOURE ONLINE BITCH
now it's like
or like postage is a pain
Omg Alan the argument I made is that I can only see a global union happening if we discover other intelligent life and Earth as a whole gets invaded or some shit
eh maybe the snail mail is on its way
before it's like
i also think it also has destroyed giving some ppl the benefit of the doubt
but i think the "social media is making us less social" has a pretty good amount of weight to it
aka an alien planet
the only reason such an organization would even be useful is if there's another organization of a similar size that it would need to cooperate or compete against
connectivity is nice yada yada
Right, responsibility exists
anyway
i work ahead bish
Yes
But I am interested if you've got the time
does that make you feel better
it's due tues
Feel free to y'know, not, if you're actually busy
but i'm doing bio hw so cut me some slack
and somehow people would still find ways to argue over it
also i'm late to reply about the drawbacks
it would have the same governing power as the List of Recognized Nations/States on Wikipedia
that flew out the window long long ago
oh optimism
(Other people are more optimistic about it)
Which is why I think it's a) unrealistic and b) dystopian
International Nations Collective
No
is there any real difference between a cosmopolitan government and like a *really* big country
even broader
even an alliance would be too binding
good job
For a sec I legit thought it was about the political doctrine
International Nations ~~Alliance~~
I honestly forgot that Cosmo was a magazine
it would have to be, in essence, a "members of the earth club"
speaking almost entirely from a cse perspective, such a government (system) would need to be so simplistic in nature that it would basically amount to being useless
What were the drawbacks you were talking about earlier?
sorry lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rZzNFHuvvs
speaking of cosmo
I don't either! I don't think it's impossible but I don't think it's gonna happen anytime even close to soon
i just don't see it happening
but i see what people are saying
cosmo isnt possible
End of history thesis etc etc
And I (personally) think it's an awful idea, but a lot of people argue that globalization is erasing boundaries and leading us to that
Basically cosmopolitanism = one world government
When I debated globalization and cosmopolitanism in geography
Oh man I'm having flashbacks to Friday
it's fascinating, but not without its drawbacks
isn't it amazing that we can connect with each other hundreds of miles away just by pressing a few buttons on a keyboard
I have a lot of like near-manic energy today though so. That's why I'm currently being A Lot more talkative than normal
Some days Im v much in a no-bullshit mood though so I guess it does depend a little
*almost* always here, though it's less characteristic of my type
INFJ here
I'm always down for an existential debate
Wholesome
bc we're old ladies at heart
i do em w/ susan
nyt mini
What crossword were you doing?
Nice
i only got it bc i locked the letter in w/ diff words
town was right
<@472541429130854421> what kind of existentialism are we feeling tn
Was it right?
Oh sorry I dipped at like the exact time I was needed
good enough
still solved it in under a minute
oh well
shit
bull
fuck
it's a pun
hamlet is a small village
wait.
your shakespearean expertise is needed
<@!503787499605458954>
is a 4 letter answer to "hamlet's relative" on a crossword "town"
why the fuck
also quick question
quite literally
i hunger for not weighing any pounds
hahahaha
Salina is tired of existence
i'm aiming for 130
going for 138 pounds of weight loss here
more just trying to eat more regularly, and tracking my weight
100 pounds
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
what rate of weight gain
I'm on the mission of gaining weight
or gaining weight
alternatively, does anyone want to embark on a mission of losing weight with me
does anyone want to have a very existential conversation with me
Yay, you definitely should see it!
It's next on my watchlist I might be going w friends this week
You have to see it to feel how cool it is
Ok yeah
I heard it was filmed like one take
It's so cool
The whole thing is made to feel like one giant long take
Just from the way it was shot
It's also probably the most technically impressive film I've seen in a long time
I was watching it with 4 other friends, two of them were crying by the end and I and another were tearing up a little actually
Wow high praise
Goes in my top 10 movies for sure
It was realllyyy good
Anyways I assume 1917 was good? It looks amazing
*roleplaying*
So yikes
And she was legit in handcuffs
For context she didn't look much older than us and I just walked through one of the sketchier areas of downtown
Idk what's happening with you guys haha
Today I saw 1917 in theatres and started tearing up while my friend next to me was just flat-out crying
Highly doubt for drinking that never happens here plus most people are legal
also rip
rip
today i saw two girls break down due to sorority rejections
No idea
Underage drinking?
for what?
Damn
Side note I just watched a girl get arrested
👀
Key qualities
Let's not forget bitter and keeps you awake all night too
wow jarrett
Ahahahaha
well that's a new take
Flat and white
I like my women how I like my coffee
"I'm my parents' favorite only child"
I'll passively think of more as I wait for this smash tourney to return from break
but I might've trademarked that one too much at one point
I'm not an exceptional programmer because good programmers don't make exceptions
that or
yes.
would this be appropriate to put on a rush application?
(does that count as wholesome)
a perfect 10 but also imaginary
my girlfriend is like the square root of -100
"spilled" wording feels forced
wholesome jokes huh
better wording
`all over my pants`
how about a more wholesome one
lmao i remember that
spilled all over my pants
I like my women like I like my tea
tell me a funny joke!
*babies in theaters*
/end mini rant
Also like, baby sounds and screaming and shit, but that's more just "hatred of babies on general"
They take up so much damn space!!!!!
I know it's necessary a lot of the time so i try not to be too annoyed about it but I have an intense hatred of babies in strollers on public transit
Destroying that group
Yes queen!!
good job helen
CRUSH THEIR SOULS UNDERFOOT
I’ve gotten better at bowling 😛
I mean shouldn't happen but if it does just swap for another tissue lol
what if I bleed through the tissue
Stick a tissue up your nostril to soak up the blood until it stops
here's mine: bleeding
I want a solution from everyone
what's the best solution to a nosebleed
`Do hiit`
It's more fun anywayd
Do hiit
Pure cardio is good for losing weight, but it's not the most efficient
I'll take edibles though
No offense to anyone who does it
Also also yeah weed is gross
i'm kidding lol
I mean not really
wow gettin wild huh
uh
~~I may be getting a high quality Canadian fake within the next week to go to a 19+ drag show~~
Also PLEASE VISIT ME!!
But just as help for house parties
I mean I've made some Very basic cocktails
I also wanna learn how to bartend!!
I meant to type bye but that works too
ye
k goodnight
lmao
if I remember
I'll snap you
lol we'll be at the gym at the same time then
sometimes it's 2 pm and i still feel like it's morning
my morning is like 10-12 am
same
*hehe*
I gotta go to the gym in the morning
rip the 3 hour difference
I am too
goodnight guys
okay
ok i think i'm going to sleep soon
hahaha
I prefer it when I have enough space in front of my to not worry about hitting another freshman who's trying to curl a 40 pound dumbbell that's obviously too heavy for his entire body to support
can't wait until i'm a sophomore living on west campus so i can use the west gym more easily
maybe a few less ellipticals, i've never seen more than half of them being used at once
i just want there to be more than one stairs machine
it's usually not a problem
west gym has two and a half benches
IMA is better for chest/shoulders etc
when you're me and schedule your mornings down to the 15 minute interval a 7 minute gap will matter
wow that's pretty far lol
tbh i think west gym is better for arms and legs
15 minute walk, 8 minute bus
yeah it's on the other side of campus
been doing that for three years
ik
not working out
best way to lose weight is by changing your diet
you have to ride a bus to get to the gym?
or if you're like me and missed a bus to get there you do all your reps in half the sets
tbh i don't care if i gain muscle or not, just looking for exercises i like other than running lmao
i know gym is all about building muscle blah blah
fast because the faster you do your 5 reps of 10 you can move on
it's not losing weight
wdym fast
it's efficient
it's quick
it's fast
weightlifting might be of interest
i tried ellipticals with resistance once, it was ok
i've recently been liking climbing stairs but there's only one stairs machine
3) stretching in various forms
my ultimate goal is to lose weight and i know pure cardio is basically useless for that
2) lift
1) run
there's like three things
idek what i want to do at the gym
I sometimes wonder if I could lift more if I went in the evening or afternoon
well it's more like 8 by the time I arrive
bc after 9 a lot of people are going to class
basically I'm trying to say that I'm out of place
generally it's empty enough in the AM
only super big dudes and the people who have their lives together
i'm also not going to be there at 7
lol
even in january
nobody's there
the gym's great at 7
maybe i can finally go to the gym tomorrow
much less that I do it to go to the gym
if i sleep by 12 it's a good day
if you told high school me this shit I would've never believed you
nice
10:30/11
when do you go to sleep?
this shit wack
dude I'm waking up at 7 on my own now
i'll probably sleep soon
yeah at least that what psych says
sleep hygiene is good shit
normal sleep schedules are good
bruh still
i don't have class tomorrow though
gah it's almost 1 am
tips appreciated in the form of smash bros games
*flips around bottles and a shaker*
sure
*alan can you make a whatever*
I'll be hosting a party or something at my apartment
that's a goal of mine in the future
for friends
private bartender
^ this one is actually true
I can make a mean shirley temple
you should be a bartender then
I did it as a job
or they taste bad but you market it nicely and people will grow to like it
I'm good at pouring things
from tea to alcohol
you just pour two or more things together until they taste good
pretty soon I'll have coverage of the entire drinks spectrum
ooh I wanna learn how to make drinks
and i'm not even 21 yet
in theory
the price of coffee shops, bars, and fast food is becoming more and more repulsive to me
breweries and wine tasting is more my speed
I won't settle for a random pub on the street
if we're gonna go to a bar we're gonna do a cool one
we could invent our own cocktails
lol
cheaper than bars anyway
completely legal too
genius
bam
then we take it back to where ever
we pick out our favorite stuff
we go to the nearest supermarket
we go to van and pick up cindy
here's the plan
Rip
if someone wants to buy me drinks i will happily consume it
tomato lookin ass
I know who to check on
If I hear reports of a massive red glow in Canada
lmfao
Don’t get too crazy
uh next august
we'll go pay cindy a visit
Y’all have fun
when do you turn 19
It’s nice
right
I don’t flush at all
i'm down to go drinking
i have a tendency towards redness but only in my face, and i'm usually wearing foundation in social situations anyway
Yike
helen we gotta go drinking cuz it's super funny lol
whoa
face chest arms all of it
I'm scared to drink anything stronger than beer because at my birthday I had one beer and literally got beet red
It’s great
HOW DARE YOU ACCUSE ME
lmaoooooo
THIS IS A WITCH HUNT
She’ll be like IM NOT TIREDDDD
ok that's good lol
Haha it’s not a problem
im sorry
I gotta deal with her tho when she’s out of it
It’s really funny
if I consume 10+ cups
Jane becomes diet Trump
and me
lol
Yup
those two
Gene and Jane
gene and jane
whos the second?
twotwotwotwotwo
two
you can get one person drunk off it
it's cheaper than most recreational drugs including alcohol and I can STILL get people drunk off it
you love tea dude or you love tea, dude?
Good on ya
god I fuckin LOVE tea dude
Man
this convo derailed fast
I've come to the right place
great
no one is
look I'm tired and we're not thinking straight right now
not addictive though
?
so tea is just my replacement for weed
and costs about as much for good stuff
but tea already relaxes me enough as is
i spent most of today manually converting decimals to binary and hexadecimal, and into IEEE floating point numbers
Very helpful boo
it should be better
Thanks Helen
that's why if I blend it with some other teas
Decimals can just rot
there i sent help
help
weed does smell gross
Send help
weed smells gross, not tempted to do it
and that should be obvious
the only way I would ever consider consuming weed is through tea
lol
oh nvm
that we're fucking crazy?
fuck equilibriums
but if we're being completely realistic here
i want to say one thing
before i go
could probably get him to get some with relative ease
brb finishing my last aleks question
damn
do you get free access to his weed too?
lol that's a bit of a stretch
jkjk ily bitch
"baby alcoholic"
before you know it you'll be a frat bro crushing a 6 pack against your forehead helen :p
there's some benefits to having a baby alcoholic as a roommate
well that's a slippery slope
i've recently gained a taste for cheap beer
lol
ken
how do you guys have beer???
i'm glad my taste buds still don't really work since i was sick
i'm gonna need it to read the rest of this
it was housed in a cheap plastic bottle
if you're getting one, grab one for me lol
the vodka was vanilla flavored
oh should I go get a beer
it's probably out of my system by now
maybe
sorry i'm drunk on one (1) shot of vodka
guess this is what life is now
sigh
goddamn
your worst nightmare, baby
what have i just walked in on
that last one isn't something that has changed
things that have changed:
- can now go drinking in vancouver
- this is your last year as a teen
- still single (~~loser~~ WINNER AND INDEPENDENT CHAMPION OF YOUR OWN PERSON)
i did a double take bc i realized you're old
I have never seen a person hot enough for me to have my thinking fully shut off
hello
I am 19
that extremely extraordinary person that I would even start considering for a hookup is a completely different kind of person that I would seek a relationship with
like
is for a completely different type of girl
no fuck you
fuck you're 19
the 1% chance
mood
99% of the time I'm gonna seek a relationship because *I've been single for 19 years and I would like someone to go sunday market shopping with*
just maybe not in yours
there will always be a perfect human being who exists in real life
hotness levels do not have to be theoretical
well lemme explain my answers more thoroughly
lmfao
i am also perfectly fine with that
or are we just discussing theoretical hotness levels reaching god and goddess statuses
ooh yes
were there more infographics?
lol
also your guyses nicknames on lakeside are "hel" and "cin" because fran and I thought it would be a fitting pair
she might have insights you're looking for
ask cin
lmfao
i was about to say "i've seen lots of unbearably hot girls but never thought of a guy as unbearably hot so does that mean i'm lesbian" then i remembered my new stats TA is super fucking hot
alright so jarrett's girl would need to reach the level "hot enough for his thinking to shut off" kind of hot
I would not feel comfortable doing sexual with someone i didnt know
No
you think you're fucking hallucinating kind of hot
so unbearably attractive that you can't even imagine it
anime girl of your dreams
walks up to you
literally the hottest person you could ever fucking imagine
2 and 3 are roughly equivalent questions, just worded differently
give it 5%
think about it
jarrett
1. Sure
2. Sure i guess
3. Absolutely not
my answer's always gonna be potential relationship
maybe i'm just stuck in my own perspective idk
if a super hot girl walks up to you and is interested, and this isn't a bar or club or other hookup location, but broad daylight, would you really prefer a one time hookup rather than a potential relationship?
5% because I'm not a fucking idiot
1) sure
2) sure?
3) 95% probably not
jarrett what would you answer
Cum and go vs actual potential relationship
hell even I'd say yes
but i'd also just want to go on a date with them too
answer would probably be yes
if i imagine i were a guy i wouldn't be surprised
"wanna come over to my place tonight?"
confident hot lady walks up to you
think about it
or that I don't get it
I can't say I'm surprised
ehhh
i'm not surprised at all that women's answers decreased so drastically but i find it hilarious that men's yes answers actually went upwards
what I'm getting is that men have very little fear
ahem
2. *nice*
lmao
huh
these are the results: so far, pretty even
I dunno depends on your personality
or more?
much less going to bed with a stranger
lol yeah right on
women might have reservations about going to a random stranger's apartment
uh
think about how men and women might respond differently
This is the hypothetical situation:
here's the next really interesting study
maybe some of the men would not actually have dated a 20 yr old woman at age 50 due to morally idk
this study just showed photos of the people and asked participants who they found most attractive in appearance
35 for older folks
I'd expect it to at least hit 30
I'm just surprised that the line didn't even touch 25
but yeah it's funny to compare the graphs
or maybe it was just super obvious lol
no I had a hunch
lol yeah did you learn this in class too?
it's because women have more limited fertility and go into menopause at some point, so men who prefer younger women are able to have more kids and pass on their genes
is it "fertility"
There's actually a really simple reason why men all like women in their mid-twenties rather than increasing the woman's age
still stands
uh
point
Alan, you are an underclassman
Comparatively, this graph shows the average age of a woman that men are most attracted to as they age...
let's ignore that I said that and carry on
...
so I should be hanging out with more underclassmen then
fascinating
This graph shows the average age of men that women find most attractive as they age. In their twenties, women prefer slightly older men, but that evens out and eventually they prefer slightly younger men, which is where cougars come from i guess
Here for another brief intermission
Amazing so far
(ahem) hi cindy how's the concert
I love the contrast in conversation going on right now
lmfao
let me prove a point with some infographics
wait i didn't mean exactly that
OUR DADS?
okay thank you just wanted confirmaiton
in fact, just the opposite is true
no
are we predispositioned to want to fuck our moms
okay preliminary question
it's fascinating
i wanted to talk about the psychology of human mating behavior
anyway
i used a lot of double negatives
lol
however i have been able to make friends so that at least means my personality is not so defunct that my impression doesn't stay the most defining thing
I'm right here
ouch
so i guess my "vibe"/impression isn't really serving me well by way of making the friends i want to make
well i've been told by a certain cool engineering nerd that she thought i was a dancer or something
because i'm a cs major and that's also my personality
but yes carry on
a rare breed
so like the people i'm trying to be friends with are engineering/cs nerds (both male and female) who have some amount of social skill
but it's okay you'll grow out of it eventually
I get it
a lot of things change in a short period of time
puberty is a tough time
not that
I'm here to support you
that's okay
what I'm getting from your reaction is that you're confused
oops
I'm part of a camp that says your appeal should match your personality
what matters is what your personality actually is
because anyone can look like anything with enough effort
at the end of the day though, whatever appeal you decide to throw upon yourself doesn't matter
i'm going for a very confusing vibe
but there's a whole *bunch* of other appeals you can go for that might suit your personality better
there was some super cool stuff
the flowery/fluffy/gentle/sweet image of a girl is only one kind of way to attract a guy and oftentimes you'll attract the guy that has very basic needs and wants
in psych today we talked about the psychology of human mating patterns
relating to that topic
oh also
uh
there's a lot of guys out there that would love to be stepped on by strong girls
lemme tell you
if the motivation for telling a girl to be more ladylike stems from the idea that girls are supposed to attract a guy
nobody asked but I'm gonna tell
and
and
and
be unladylike
a guy who's scared of a girl not being ladylike is a guy who's scared of that girl
i've never heard of 2) happening, sounds like something from a movie
2) a guy with extremely fragile ego
1) their mom/aunt/caretaker
my first instinct is that the person telling the girl to be more ladylike is either
whenever I hear a girl being told to be more "ladylike"
at this point idek what i'm talking about or what point i'm trying to make
i think that's mostly just because if you have an explosive attention-grabbing personality then you're generally more acknowledged as a member of society
but it seems like bitchy girls (just enough to be seen as hip, but not a total ass) are more acknowledged for their sass and bitchiness than kind girls are acknowledged for their kindness
of course no guy likes bitchy girls
Well depends on what you mean by bitchy i guess
i think opinions are different when you're on the side that's doing the being attracted towards females
Being bitchy is not fashionable
whether or not that's a good thing is debatable
Hard disagree
in fact being bitchy is more fashionable than being gentle-kind
i feel like that sort of femininity is becoming less and less in fashion so you're fine
LMAO
but other than that i feel like every part of my personality can be found in a large number of other normal girls
And I never finished talking about the gentle thing but y'know how Disney princesses are always like absurdly nice to everyone and have birds n shit lining their arms and let mice live in their houses
to be clear i'm still not a cliquey groupie
i guess it depends on your definition of normal girl
Is it??
i've been realizing more and more that my entire personality is just normal girl
i get what you're referring to
like tough love?
Like there's rough-kindness and soft-kindness
Idk how to explain this right but in my head I imagine different dimensions of a lot of traits
gentle in what sense?
lmao
But like personally I can't imagine being. Idk, gentle
lol i just read an interesting article on "i'm not like most girls"
Also disclaimer I'm not saying this to be like "I'm not like most girls" I don't give a shit about that and it's fine to be "feminine"
when the subject to be angry about is less personal, usually i feel like it results in a lot of complaining and commiserating with friends
like imagine screaming, crying, general emotional fit
a lot of girls are very "emotionally" angry
Oh that's interesting elaborate
girls get angry about plenty of things very frequently but you being angry has a different "energy"
Like I'm obviously female, I identify as female, but if you go by the "energy" thing
i think you're more aggressive and get angry about stuff than most girls, especially in like fourth grade lmao
Like a lot of adults, actually, but that's kinda besides the point
huh
Not just parents
no offense but i don't think they really count since they're from a different culture and don't know a lot about what most girls in the US are like
parents?
by who?
`Idk what “masculinity” would even manifest as in a girl` ive been told many times that I have a "masculine" personality and should learn to be sweeter or more "ladylike"
As in "masculine" = aggressive, assertive, in control, unemotional, etc while "feminine" = soft, sweet, kind, emotional, sensitive etc
It has to do w traditional gender roles
Hello I'm back for a few mins
it's in a lot of things like posture, motions and speech patterns
like there are some guys who just seem very "bro" but you only just met them and have no idea what their actual hobbies are
I know on internet quizzes and stuff, masculinity is usually associated with things like being leaderlike or heroic or something, but i feel like irl a person's masculinity or femininity is more of a vibe than broad personality characteristics
Idk what “masculinity” would even manifest as in a girl
this is why
with detailed explanations, critiques, and points of interest
so if you're wondering why I can make a tierlist of the last 7 seasons of cute girls doing cute things shows
and also explains why I'm so open about liking the stuff: it's genuinely sparked a positive change in my life and I won't deny it just because it seems silly or trivial, and made me learn that I shouldn't care about what people think about what I enjoy and instead focus on just enjoying it
but in short, it was the cute anime girls that convinced Alan that he didn't need to keep up this image of being a "manly man"
as well as Dragon Maid
that one has almost a 50/50 split
except K-ON
but I didn't know that at the time
in the end though, yeah, you'd be right, it's primarily a male-dominated interest
so different demographic same purpose
well there's also all the yaoi and BL stuff
> very much a male thing is it not
after a small identity crisis I moved to just liking what I liked and enjoying it all without regard to what other people think
the notion of a super manly man watching a show about cute girls was completely incompatible with my mental image
I feel like I remember this now but also the cute anime girls thing is. very much a male thing is it not
someone gimme a psych degree
specifically, Gabriel Dropout
oh that was a guess lol
damn
it was cute anime girls
cute anime girls doing cute things?
...tea?
uhhhhhhhh
it's one of my primary interests as of today
I feel like I've definitely heard this story before but I don't remember
I might've mentioned it before
take a guess on what it was
things changed radically with the course of one event
but I definitely was on the "BIG MANLY MAN" thing in middle school
oh I get that
I'm not tryna insult your masculinity lmao I said "somewhat agree" bc you're not huge on the BIG MANLY MAN thing
because tea is **legit**
tea
Decorate because **aesthetic**
I clean because I'm a neat freak and like it when things look pretty and clean
I would argue that "masculine" and "feminine" energies are a social construct with little inherent value, but hey, per the thomas theorem, they have real consequences so we're forced to acknowledge said social construct as real
my favorite kind of cooking is high end steak
but I'm into those things for the *craft* of the experience
which is a weird mashup of masculine, feminine, and projects
I personally think I lean very *Noah*
just got a shipment of my favorite shampoo and conditioner from Japan
I cook, clean, decorate, like tea
like yeah
I would argue that I'm well balanced and leaning towards masculine just because of my lifestyle
anyways
okay that's enough out of him
**TO CRAFT, REFINE, AND HONE YOUR TECHNIQ-**
what is even happening nymore
**AND TO STAND AMONG THE GREATEST OF YOUR COMMUNITY IS A DUTY AND AN HONOR**
**TO PLAY SMASH IS TO PLAY WITH THE HANDS OF GOD**
what the fuck alan lmao
**TO LOOK INTO THE EYE OF YOUR OPPONENT AND FEEL NO SYMPATHY WHEN YOU SPIKE THEM INTO THE ABYSS IS TO ASCEND INTO NEVERENDING BLISS**
but that's not the point
hey I was/am Gold
where people get hand surgery from playing so hard
not even good
aren't you like
that's Starcraft 2
no no no
**WHERE VICTORY OVER YOUR OPPONENT IS WON BY STRENGTH, WILL, AND MIND**
**Smash Bros. is the battleground of the SOUL**
lemme bring that out a little
ahem
I think you guys forgot to include the smash part of my personality
I voted neutral on feminine but agree on masculine
And if you're talking about me Noah then yes I agree lol
I vote somewhat agree on masculine neither for feminine
then I'd say Cindy also counts as well
but
not agressive
Okay true
Maybe somewhat disagree on masculine
*Noah*
So I'll say neutral on both
I'm not even sure what being masculine means haha, if it means the traditional muscly, aggressive sense of the word none of us in this group really count as masculine
can I get a group vote
Wow lmao
please exercise caution
there have been reports that irony levels are being exceeded in the premise
irony police here
hello
damn
This is so fucking funny
Samyak huh
who is samyak?
samyak Huh
samyak huh
Samyak huh
I don't get it
?
Um yikes
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
why?
just **kaze**
but 風邪 isn't pronounced **kaze yokushima**
meaning wicked or evil
邪 is read as **yokushima**
it has a reading
but on it's own?
so the second character is literally just silent
and 風邪 is pronounced **kaze**
風 is pronounced **kaze**

(yes it also means wind)
you would naturally think that it would probably be pronounced **ka**
Wind?
風
that first character is also a word
pronounced **kaze**
風邪
this is the word for a cold

You know me
I'm always flirting with people
Dam.
sorry I don't speak retard
<@470822754262712329> you smell nice
hello? police?
Lmao hi <@470822754262712329>
you fuck off
“Wow you smell nice”
“Dude what are you smoking”
“Your fumes”
“Fuck off”
I dont think many guys I know would have a positive response to me saying that they smell nice/different
Okay maybe it's more of a girl to girl thing to do
Omg wow
*are* you trying to flirt w someone? 👀
This is such a random topic though Alan what brought this on
No, I was not tryna flirt w her
Knowing that it was probably a lotion of some kind
I mentioned to Helen that her hands smelled really nice
Also also one of the offshoot scenarios that Jarrett is making up to make fun of the situation literally happened this week when y'all were at my house 💀
Also I literally don't understand what Jarrett said in that sentence
But it could be uncomfortable if you don't know them well
I've literally told friends to smell my hair before
Like it's not weird unless you make it weird
I don't think it's that weird of a thing to compliment
Ah shit you're right
Cindy's argument gains credibility
> It's not like other things that take time/thought like hair
no u
no u
"Hey did you change your soap? Your arm hair smells amazing"
Specifically hair
"Hey did you change your soap? Your arms smell amazing"
I do think it can be a little weird to comment on how someone's hair smells, but there's probably a way to do it. Granted, I wouldn't recommend it unless you were friends with the person.
I'd argue that it still does, but I see your point
It's not like other things that take time/thought like hair
But it's shampoo
Attempting to compliment them and be nice like a normal person
Like the best case scenario that I see happening is "yes I did"
If you're not flirting then what's the point of asking someone if they changed their shampoo?
Okay very honest question
My answer would prob just be "dude your hair smells amazing" or "in the least creepy way possible, you smell really good today", something along those lines
Hell, regular perfume
Heat spray
Styling products
Dry shampoo
Conditioner
Leave-in products
I mean the thing is if you just notice that their hair smells different it could be A Lot of different things
“Have you been abluting your hair in a new cleaning agent with more appealing aromatic qualities?”
"Yo are you marinating your hair in a different sauce these days?"
It's a completely "on-brand" answer I know
Quickly switch the conversation topic off the fact that you noticed and start talking about something else
"It kinda reminds me of (tea), it smells nice."
(Affirmative answer)
"Hey, did you change your shampoo?"
If I had give an answer it would go like
Almost
I'm fascinated by it because it almost seems like a no solution problem
And excuse me I pay extra fine attention to shampoo
Situation is mostly theoretical
Guys are more likely to be uncomfortable in general and also 1000x less likely to even know what specific shampoo they like
Girls are less likely to interpret such a thing as a bad attempt at romance than guys (from a girl)
Like I know people who would overthink it or be weirded out or assume I'm into them but I also know people who wouldn't really care and would just be flattered
Other things also factor in bc like I have acquaintances I don't know well but am still very comfortable around
Well as Helen asked is this actually hypothetical or not
Boring but okay
Yeah
TBH probably wouldn't comment on it
Is this really a completely hypothetical situation lol
Let's say you two are acquainted but don't know each other very well
Like if it was any of you I'd just be like "you/your hair smells really nice" and that'd be that
Kinda depends on your comfort level w this person
^
Uh
(if ladies want in on it, try taking the reverse situation where you notice a guy changed his shampoo and try to do the same, or if you're Cindy do whichever one you want)
Answers will be judged by the council of ladies
A girl you know walks by you and you notice she changed shampoos, how do you compliment her without coming off as creepy?
Alright fellas here's a theoretical for yall
We have a lot of channels as is. I'm not opposed to it, but with my current understanding of things, it wouldn't be a great use of space. The only people I can think of who are actively learning a language are you and Cindy, and you guys are learning different languages. There's already plenty of channels that could be made relevant, and it never hurts to use general. Again, I have an open mind about it, but I don't see the need.
can we get a language learning channel

My New Years resolution is actually to lose weight, how boring can I get 😂
Anyways I actually am doing a full reread including the silm this time and damn I totally forgot that the og source of "not all who wander are lost" was tolkein
Example from my pinterest
I've been reading and searching so much Lord of the rings related stuff this past week that I'm getting ads for like. Engagement rings and I find it fucking hilarious
mild
**wild**
***wild***
Wild
I may need to order more
which is a problem
I'm already about 1/3 of the way through this bag though
I should also mention this is one of the three teas I bought in Leavenworth
contains very little caffeine from what I can tell, so it's the perfect drink to have if you're looking to have something right before bed
quite fragrant, the lemon grass mixed with peppermint gives it a very fresh and rejuvenating aroma
it's a gentler blend, refreshing but also relaxing
tonight's wind-me-down is a blend of chamomile, lemon grass, and peppermint
**dramatic music**

In a twisted turn of events
But maybe ask him
I vote no
"Sup my nigga"

"Ah, how's it going my n-word"
Is that the appropriate response?
But if a black dude calls you 'my nigga' is it okay to call him 'my nigga' back?
I'm not sure where to ask this question
The history I mentioned ^^
https://youtu.be/ayH0oyV5Xwo
That doesn't mean I think they should be hunted down for their organs
I disagree with most religions/spiritual groups
I never said I agree with it
that makes it pretty cultish
he portrays himself as the supreme god being i guess
Which seems rather cult-like
And he's got some sorta apocalypse gig going on
And believe in aliens
And evolution
But doesn't the founder hate gays
Am I wrong
most cults are persecuted spiritual groups
The political history of why the ccp hates them now is super interesting
It's a persecuted spiritual group
Falun gong is not a cult
aren't they part of that "cult" called Falun Gong
Their claims against China are quite interesting too
Oh yeah I’ve seen some vids like that
This is very interesting
For anyone who has seen shen yun ads EVERYWHERE
https://youtu.be/-H13NWTDTRk
alright, no worries. we're always here if you need anyone to listen though. take care of yourself and get some rest eventually. good luck with the family situation.
That’s cause I don’t do much. Anyways. I’m done. I’m good.
although i doubt they'd have too many negative things to say about you.
ok, yeah, that in itself is never comfortable. i feel that.
And having to wonder what they’re saying about you when you’re not around.
Is knowing that my entire family are gossip mongers
Like the worst thing about listening to this stuff.
Ikr
they just  k n o w
the web of asian relatives spreads anything mildly interesting faster than the silk road
We don’t live in Southern California
Yoof. I don’t even know how my mom knows this stuff.
but i'm glad you're doing better at least
although rip your cousins and their girlfriends though
oh, that's a relief lmao
And entertaining.
Which is much less emotionally stressful.
Oh my god. That are now gossiping about my cousins’ girlfriends.
i think not being in school is lowkey making me lose it
muahahahaha
and stay away from windows
^
get some sleep
we're always happy to listen.
stay sane
that's fair
Just needed to vent a lil.
And thx
Lol
gl w the fam situation
pls don't take me seriously
jkjk
no house = less contention?
well
please try your best to take care of yourself. you're worth keeping your sanity.
The house is a major point of contention.
That would be bad.
ah alright
Noppo
casual arson, at your service
would you like me to come by and torch the house?
Nope. There’s no escaping. I can only listen and absorb.
is there anything we could do to help get your mind off of it?
And me too
But like out of discomfort.
i hope things get better soon
It’s a situation that I’m grinning about
damn, i'm really sorry. that sounds like an absolute mess.
ah
But family lines have been drawn.
It’s the older generation that’s in a tizzy.
We’re good.
Yep
hang in there
ripperoo
but also
But this is eating up my time and mental facilities.
that's fair
Cause privacy
And I won’t give concrete details
Only he’s not gonna show anyone because the family has already disobeyed her wishes of keeping the fam together.
Except maybe there are videos from her that my uncle has.
y i k e r s
"this is what reconciliation looks like"
Cause she didn’t leave a will.
oh boyyyy
And the fam has been falling apart since.
Cause like my grandma died two years ago.
Who even knows what.
I’ve been sitting on a couch for three hours while my parents and aunt and uncle are
spilll
oh no
Y’all the family drama is insane.
oh boi
OH
Idk, maybe the part where he caught on fire
What incident
Hey, man, he's pretty hot, especially after his incident
Yes but that's a low bar
Anakin's more attractive than Kylo
You just don’t appreciate the rat tail braid enough lol
Hard pass
Also Obi Wan is p attractive in the prequels but Anakin???? Nah fam
Oscar Isaac is 1000x more attractive than the star wars version of Severus Snape
This is blasphemy
GENE
Hahahahaha
> Alan can back me up on this I'm sure
sorry I'm gonna have to plead the 5th on this one, you're on your own bud
do you not find dogs and cats cute <@!472541429130854421>?
Are you admitting to bestiality
5 year old girl = still can be cute but like in a dog/cat sorta way
Pardon the misunderstanding
5 ft tall girl = cute
Get your mind out of the gutter Gene
I saw your description, and that was the first thing that came to mind. My bad.
Not a pedo
I am in fact
Gene
Errrr I guess its more like an inverse graph
Wait, when we say "small," are we referring to someone who's, like, underage, or someone who is of age and of a small stature?
Oh my god do I have to explain the cute-hot spectrum again
guess i ain't cute
Alan can back me up on this I'm sure
damn
Small girls are cute
Yes??
That's the bad part to you?
Wait
``Like a small girl``
Jarrett what the actual fuck
Which droid is the most attractive to you then?
I don't like that line of logic for many reasons
U h h h h
Like a small girl
That however still makes them attractive
It is however worth noting that the mouse droids are cute, not hot
1. The Magnaguards
2. Mouse Droids
3. L3-37 from Solo
4. The Medical Droids
5. Commando Droids
i tire of trying to figure out how to talk like jarjar off a quote list
deliver the goods
<@!173668455856340994>
I refuse to roger roger that
yousa point not good
sounds like a great idea
ex-squeeze me
Next he's gonna say which droids are most attractive
don't kink shame
hey, hey there
Salina, please don't encourage him
No, Jarrett, NO
meesa looking pretty good tonight
Jar jar is pretty hot
To clarify, I don't find Episode One Anakin attractive either. I'm not Padme.
the douchenozzle face with the $1 hair extension
how can you resist
I'm not talking about episode two and his god damn rat tail
edgy viking braid
But we're not living in prequel trilogy levels of attractiveness like you got with Anakin and Obi-Wan
He does give out his jacket tho, so he's boyfriend material
Moderately attractive, but loses out to Kylo
Is Poe not attractive?
Wait
There's not that much competition though
I mean, he's kinda the hottest male character in the sequel trilogy
Ouch
At least by celebrity standards
ofc gene would know
He's kinda hot, but he's not super hot
Kylo is just even more emo Loki
different strokes for different folks
i don't care for him either but i'll make as many jokes as i want
some people just want to be at the end of that driver
I feel nothing
Maybe he's too emo for me as kylo
Idk he seems like a cool dude but I don't get the hype
who knows lmao
maybe the beak
dat chest ;)
Do people actually find Adam Driver attractive
that fast
shit
oh shit what
me realizing we're 5 days to christmas:
Esp since she tries to “advocate” for gay rights and the gay and trans community are linked to an extent
I find it so interesting bc she tries really hard to be #woke
But yeah that’s a rip
Idek
Why is she like this
Ugh
Anti trans stances huh
JK Rowling
So
❤️❤️
It's thanks to you guys for the practice, much appreciated
And she told me "wow, you're really good at this" 😂
She was going around hugging everyone since we're heading home for break
Yesterday, a friend complimented me on my hugging
24 hr fitness
What gym?
He’s ripped
Ran into Calvin Jensen at the gym
I ran into a few people yesterday, some of whom I didn't recognize
lol
It was really awkward lmfao
I just ran into Vivek @ SBP
YAAAAAAY HELEN'S BACK
Yikeroo
Oh rip 😦
Also she threw away all the paper on my shelves, including a lot of stuff I genuinely treasured
Lmao that’s the opposite of my mom
See the thing is my mom's idea of "cleaning" or "organizing" is just "shoving everything into a less visible area i.e. the closet"
I never got to organizing all the stuff after moving so my shelves were random piles of crap
Ok fair I guess lmao
Actually it’s an improvement for me
GOD SAME IT'S THE WORST
Just entered my room to see my mom reorganized everything lmao
so maybe it's for the better
it prob would've made me hungry
rip
lol
just got done
If you're not already done I'm down call me or smth
Watch you make pancakes?
... anyone wanna watch?
and don't have literally anything I could make besides a second helping of ramen and pancake mix
because I'm hungry
have elected to make pancakes
update
Mix options 1 and 2
Hot cocoa
I've already started on option 2
4) Dump it (it was dining cash anyways)
3) Drink it straight from the carton, taking occasional sips as I peruse the new Winter Chillhop 2019 collection
2) Make 4 cups of hot cocoa
1) Make 3 protein shakes
do I
there's about half a gallon of milk
but I need to finish the stuff in the fridge
I finally get to go home tomorrow
sigh
yeah
Was expected though
Yep
also jeremy corbyn is resigning
btw in case no one was paying attention the UK election was yesterday and the conservatives won by a 14-point landslide
a few days ago he made this follow up
tom scott made a video in 2014 about it
oh I already know a decent bit about this topic
Love Tom Scott
<@!503787499605458954> might be interested

think so
Canada has an extradition treaty right?
I just saw a guy who looked creepily like Edward Snowden
I had a dream about picking out my white hairs
That’s really young to die
big yikes
Oh FUCK
And it wasn't even drugs or anything
That's like the 4th major young hip hop artist who's died in the past 2 years
I didn't even like him but still, damn

Yo holy shit I just saw this on twitter
I've never gotten the whole shoes on indoors thing
I cringe but then use it as an excuse to wear shoes indoors myself
oh god
ewwwwwwwwww
*inside*
Wearing shoes
And everybody is just like
I'm at a white person's house party
lol I saw stuff about impeachment but I wanted a better idea before jumping to conclusions
alright cool
It might not feel like it but we really are living through historic times. This shit is so important. If you care about the state of the world, your country of citizenship, or the decline of liberal democracy as we know it... Well. Political apathy is a HUGE reason for why things are going downhill
But also if you have 20-30 mins of spare time each day it will make you 300x more educated about the world if you open a few news sites or listen to a news podcast
I could go into a Lot of detail about the actual situation and allegations if you want the long-but-still-summarized answer
The short answer is yes and also Gene's right for the most part
Man, sometimes I forget that 99% of people arent reading the news
I should probably pay attention to my math review session instead lol
Looking through some articles, and it looks like they'll go through the impeachment process, but they'll be hard-pressed to convince the Senate to remove him from office, but this has been 10 minutes worth of Gene's skimming through articles, so take that with a large grain of salt
I'm a little out of the loop, but I think they're making steps in that direction. I should look into it more cuz this seems like it might get really important.
I heard some news circulating
<@503787499605458954> are we actually gonna impeach Trump now
this hurts
Thank you for this enlightening information
thanks for coming to my ted talk
my name can be rearranged to "anal"
fun fact
well well wellll

Lol
I have a new favorite channel
damn jiayi you got some doppelgangers running around
Damn haha
I'm p sure I've also hung out around your parents a lot more than you have mine
Ok fair I can kind of remember what your dad sounds like
You remember what my dad sounds like?
damn, all in one day?
A guy at the restaurant I'm at now sounded SO MUCH like <@472541429130854421> 's dad that I had to do a MAJOR double take
no worries lmao
Sorry got distracted by more food arriving
what was the second thing?
At the ramen place we went to for lunch, I saw someone who looked so much like <@233062637922025472> that I almost went up and asked what he was doing in Vancouver
Ok 2 things happened today that freaked me the fuck out
I can see that. It's hard to find people in general, so when you devote energy into it, interesting single people who are also interested in you feel fewer and further in between
I feel like it’s harder to find people when you’re actively looking lol
That’s fair
Mainly cuz I'm not actively looking for people at the moment though
I don't think it's happening any time soon
Oof no
Has any real life Olivia appeared yet?
Hm that's true I guess
The biggest problem with bumble and tinder to me is that you can’t filter by university
I also looked up bumble on Google to get more info on this, and I literally got a "Meet singles in Sammamish" ad
This sounds very cursed
The last one is a bit cursed
There’s also a part of the app for friendships and for business connections
Wait, what. Why did I not know this?
Yeah
(also, valid judgement)
Wait, is Bumble for dating?
That’s why I’m not dating you guys
Too be fair, most of us are dweebs too
Deleting again
Ok all that’s on there is dweebs
Unrelated but I’m tempted to reopen my Bumble account lmao
People are already starting to move back in
Sorry that everyone left
Well, glad to hear? Lmao
I’ve moved back already lol
Oof, I'm sorry
I’m not going to continue doing it tonight
It’s actually very uneventful
How's that been? That sounds eventful.
So basically I’ve been couch surfing for the last two nights
It’s a really nice new building which is half the incentive
So me and a friend decided to “move into” another residence hall where another friend lives
My dorm is very very empty
I did know toothpaste expires because I spent much of my childhood inspecting all the things in our bathroom drawers
I did not know that toothpaste expires and that's kind of a terrifying thought
The spare toothpaste in my bottom drawer expired in 2009
Did you know that toothpaste expires?
I love trying to find toothpaste to brush my teeth with at 3:30 AM
I hope things work out
Yiiiike, I'm sorry, Cindy
gotta love that my dad still thinks he knows vancouver better than me even though I live here now

every single thing that matters in my life matter because I say it does and for no other reason
at least for me in my mind
this conversation has meaning because I say it does
i disagree actually
just as meaningless in context as without
at the end of the day, this conversation is really just an exercise in thought and rhetoric
"okay."
the second one goes
*silence*
the best way I've been able to describe this thinking paradigm is
in fact you're putting too much energy into it
yup
there's no point to anything if you dont exist
that's the point
exactly
there would be no point to this whole debate even
once you stop existing you don't have possibility or potential anymore
you wouldnt be human, you wouldnt have thoughts
*potential*
*possibility*
blank space
*chaos*
0= __________
*balance, harmony*
0 = 0
okay but think about it mathematically
nothing there to be in harmony
non-existence isnt harmony, it's just nothing
(I think that's a proper use of a hyphen I'll have to check)
the second-closest is not caring
non-existence is the closest you can get to harmony is something I actually agree with
constant nothingness isnt an existence
I think that's the argument Emolan was making
avoiding joy because we're afraid of losing it defeats the whole purpose of having joy
it would be the potential to be sad that you lost it
no
actually
I'm p sure that's not how it works
> if everything is a treasure then nothing is
that's pretty close to the point of the sadboy post, if we really did appreciate all the "treasures" in our lives we wouldn't have the potential to ~~lose it all~~
sometimes shit happens so you gotta roll with it
^
there's too much to life, too much to think about to care about everything
^
survival does not necessarily look after the fine details
but as a whole, i think humanity is a lot more reckless than that
if everything is a treasure then nothing is
yes it can be beneficial
but i don't necessarily that applies to humanity as a whole
basically treating everything as a treasure as to make sure it lasts longer
aka what I do with mine
ex. taking good care of a laptop every day as opposed to getting rougher with it as it gets old
i would disagree
> how is there an evolutionary advantage to realizing the emotional value/importance of everything
maybe by paying closer attention to things that could potentially hurt us if we didn't pay such close attention?
so like, yeah, recognize and appreciate what we've got, including the awesome as-far-as-we-know singular chance at consciousness, but thinking of it in moral terms is pointless
also also, humans in general don't deserve shit lmao the entire society we've built is based on luck
or something like that
it should've been "give a kid 1000 toys for a year and then take them all away but one, and he'll cherish that one forever"
I think I made a mistake with the kid and the toy example
also, there's no point in trying to avoid Sadness As A Whole Emotion
I guess my take is that life only has some sort of meaning because it ends, yknow? do something with the time you have, because wow. it's fucking wild that we all exist (even if this is a simulation)
lemme go read what you guys actually said lol
I mean if you wanna think about it in those terms, I don't think "true harmony with the world and one's self" is achievable, so yeah sure you get there by not existing
*we have controlled existentialism here because we keep it classy*
otherwise the world would never function because that's far too idealistic
aw babe pop some advil
i don't believe we need to *deserve* the good things around us
my stomach ache is kinda killing me over here
don't make me rehash those
to not exist?
/end2
so in the end, is the solution to all the madness, and to achieve true harmony with the world and one's self,
i've had similar discussions with noah
whether or not we see its value doesn't detract from the fact that we, to some degree, value it
ok I'm like basically on the same page as salina here lmao
i don't think we have to justify enjoying the good things in our lives
`how can we justify having so many good things in our lives without valuing it to the extent that it's worth?` does it need to be justified?
i'mma go out on a limb and say no
or just stupid?
greedy?
is that selfish?
how can we justify having so many good things in our lives without valuing it to the extent that it's worth?
but a lot of amazing work and art is attributed to pain and emotion
see: brave new world
bliss is, for most part, a fruitless state of mind
because there will always be a balance
why does being happy invite the possibility of being sad?
i don't think it's really "setting ourselves up to be sad"
why are we setting ourselves up to be sad, just by having things we like?
it's more about survival than about appreciation
the first inklings of selflessness within human development can be pointed toward egocentrism and altruism
like ok I know you're sad boiing but from a practical standpoint how is there an evolutionary advantage to realizing the emotional value/importance of everything
i would argue that humanity isn't wired for gratitude
is it really?
it's ludicrous
because our brains aren't built to comprehend and fully appreciate every detail in our lives
and the idea that you may only realize you've taken it for granted once it has been taken away is maddening
it's impossible to comprehend every single thing you've taken for granted
why is it so hard for us to realize the importance and value of everything in our lives?
why do humans work in such a way?
but why
and can be seen in such phrases as "you only realize the value of things after they've been taken away"
i would saying taking things for granted is more the lack of gratitude than the indulgence of joy
happiness doesn't necessarily imply gratitude
s e r o t o n i n
it's often mistaken as "taking things for granted"
a lot of the time, happiness works in the same way
happiness can be tied to an event but i would argue it's also a state of mind
you can just feel happy or sad it's part of the range of human emotion
tragedy implies an event
also, happiness/tragedy aren't great oppositional forces
but give a child one toy they want, and they'll cherish it forever
if you give a child every toy they ever wanted, they eventually grow bored of them all
like obviously you can't be happy all the time
fuck
*wouldn't
I was thinking more along the lines of I don't think we wouldn't appreciate fleeting moments of happiness if we didn't have something to contrast it with
there is no potential for happiness without the potential for tragedy
the opposite is true as well
that's a bit extreme
but that's not it
then we should never create the potential for happiness
but potential does not need to be happiness
if the potential for tragedy lies in the potential for happiness
i think tragedy is the price of potential, not necessarily happiness
i think if we want to equate things to each other
on the price to pay part
so then for humans to be truly at peace with themselves, the best answer would be to be nothing
I think
I would actually agree
because if there is nothing to lose in the first place, wouldn't there be nothing to be sad about?
i would say no there
is tragedy, then, the price to pay for happiness?
to answer the question, I would say "sometimes"
ah. well, maybe she loved him. and it's not just the wife who's gonna be affected
so therefore, is tragedy then just a result of a lost potential for happiness?
think that
alzheimers
old guy forgot his wife's name
kinda
like them dying?
in what context
what is there to be sad about if the husband never loved his wife anways?
what is there to be sad about if the child was never going to grow up to live a happy life anyways?
let me give an example
excitement
joy
it's happiness
something that's completely opposite of these tragedies
I wager it's something else
to inspire us to fix the things that brought upon these circumstances?
to tell us to live our lives to the fullest?
remind us that "this could happen to any one of us?"
is there something specific that brought this on?
what does it do?
it's just there.
catharsis is not inherently beneficial or positive
there's no "repressed" emotions to release here
or the realization that we're all going to die someday
but it is in itself a type of catharsis
it's not a positive catharsis
I think it humanizes people
i would disagree with that
idk if I agree with that
an old man forgetting the name of his wife
there's no benefit of reading about a child with terminal cancer
there's no catharsis in tragedy
I don't agree with it though
hm
for sad things?
really?
*the process of releasing, and thereby providing relief from, strong or repressed emotions.*
the common answer is "catharsis"
ok real answer probably to relate in some way
bc we like having our feelings toyed with
why do we read to, listen to, watch, and enjoy sad things?
and they'd probably think I was either suicidal or crazy
what's the point? they'd only have a day to process it
personally I don't think I'd tell anyone
well damn this is a hell of a topic to come back to
/end1
all stated, within the time of a single day
and what you cared for
what you wanted
who you were
will be the truest reflection you
and I think that
all that's left is what we want the world to remember us by
because at the end of those 24 hours, if we were to cease to exist
and I think how each one of us would spend those would differ in their own, unique ways
there may be countless ways one could spend 24 hours preparing for their death
in a more peaceful, complete way
such that the world may move on without you
stating beneficiaries
writing a will
tidying up your room
or maybe you would spend what little time you had left preparing the world around you for a future without you
seeking out more risk, taking more gambles, with the notion "there's nothing left to lose"
perhaps you would live your life dangerously
or seek peace with it, succumbing to a slow, peaceful demise?
would you try and face your fate head on, fighting to change it with all your ability
and pass on, with the last memories of you being happy?
or would you just live your life for the next 24 hours the best you could
would you burden them with the knowledge?
well now i'm concerned
your parents? your friends? strangers?
who?
would you tell others?
you are the only person that knows
what if you suddenly knew you were going to be dead in 24 hours
have fun
mmh alright
I do my best writing like this
no lemme emo for a bit
as in be more specific
and create some *quality* sadboy stuff
do you want to talk about it?
so we're gonna leverage it
alright
I know that
but
no
> you ok dude?
Is it okay to choose ignorance, so long as nobody can be hurt by it but yourself?
you ok dude?
so
I've got a good sadboy mood going on right now and <#532695531898667049> is currently busy with my Tom Brier story
yeah pretty much. i'm sure people broke that rule all the time though 👀 we talked about it mostly in the context of how christianity is the root of most western homophobia though so rip
"have fun"
"youre a top now"
... fun
basically in athens the gender of who you were fucking didn't matter, just the power dynamic i.e. sexual relations had to be between a citizen and a non-citizen and the citizen would always be dominant
it was such a weird rabbit hole of history
one of the most interesting things (to me) we've learned this semester was about how citizenship affected who topped in gay relationships in ancient greece
lol you're good
um yeah i get that
sorry sorry
piketty pockketty lets see the wealth gap go rocketty
I don't like how it's presented as Truth
like we talked about wealth inequality and she only presented on Piketty's argument of capital vs. economic growth and everyone else was super into it I guess but I literally learned about why Piketty's theory is super flawed in econ last year
it really bothers me
they only ever talk about one side of the story, they never critique the theories they present
I get the strong sense that both my prof and the TAs are super biased
it's sometimes really interesting, I think I might dislike how it's being taught more than the content itself but I can't tell
it's kinda funny bc one of my friends here hates poli and loves soci and I'm the opposite so sometimes we coordinate which classes we each skip and then share notes
rip you
I feel like you might like it but it was Not What I Expected
i need to take it in the future for premed/pubhealth
oh fun
btw, I think i officially hate sociology
i better have a free ticket to fucking slack my ass off
i'm taking psych next quarter
oh hey we're also talking about behaviorism in soci
physical/cognitive/social dev
behaviorism
conditioning
piaget
that is not what I expected
yeah
oh really??
we haven't done actual nursing stuff
... it's basically a psych class
what do you guys actually learn in nursing? idk much bout it
fun fun times
my child was an overachiever
lol
basically pick your own adventure but built into our online textbook
jane's kid ended up as a hoodlum
like the sims?
what an adventure
excuse me?
and lived virtual lives too
we raised virtual children
"ok boomers"
yeah
lmao
old old adults?
old old people
adults
kids
nursing is just
oh cool
but in a more global context, I guess
the class itself feels a Lot like ib english pt 2
except she's south african and has one of the coolest accents ever
tbh my arts studies prof reminds me a lot of matheny
smh
bigger
even
I'm p sure she knew or at least suspected that I was just bullshitting
smh as if i finished anything in her class
matheny didn't raise yo sorry ass in the cradle of ib so you could just not read your books in college
but yeah
read yo fucking book
somehow I actually predicted it really well LOL
man
...................................
like I was just making shit up today bc I haven't finished the book yet
dazzle them with your brilliance
use the beeg words
lmao
dude I don't even pay attention in my lit class and I somehow still got designated the "awkward silence filler"
I was about to say if you participate and it sounds like no one else does you're prob fine
i think so yeah
i think she likes me because i actually TALK in class but hot diggity i'm nervous for portfolio grading
wait ok are each of your classes individually graded on a 4.0 scale?
bc i need the 3.9/4.0 tytyty
now i just need her to not try to spike my grade on a pole
honestly great prof
and sounds really interesting tbh
aw that's good to hear
we centered a lot of cultural context and identity in writing in the course bc that's a core part of the prof's dissertation
i just really enjoy the assignments and topics we explored in this class
and nursing is it's own kind of L
chem is a snore fest not bc it's boring but hot damn it's hard to stay awake in class
english
anyways lol. do you have a fave class?
but she's genuinely really pretty also and her makeup and nails are always 👌 like to the point where sometimes I get distracted by the glitter during lecture
nice
more is more, if she wants to wear hot pink with huge pearls and leopard print boots she's gonna do it and fuck y'all
lmao
she has the most iconic fashion sense
my russian prof is a phd in linguistics, p sure she's talked about smth similar actually. I have yet to meet a russian lady who isn't a completely badass, btw
lol
that's kinda ironic
ayy
it's a famous linguistics book lol
she's in the middle of doing another book rn
yeah idk why you'd do that unless you just really like it
big L
not the greatest deal, let's go with that
she got paid 2k to translate a 400 page book over 9 months
yikes
bc she's like "you get paid like shit to do the actual translations and also if you're on tenure at university it's not counted as a published work bc it's not an original work"
but yeah when she talked about doing it as a job it was p depressing
english to chinese and i think she's done french to chinese
english-chinese or?
oh damn
bc she's a translator on the side
we also spent a week on translations which was super cool
v edgy, v postmodern
anyways basically his thing is "the only way to be completely wrong is to say you're completely right"
good work
yeah idk what that was lmao I just realized how far apart the keys are
he has a whooooole rant on the western binary mode of thinking
your fingers be drunk
bitch go to sleep
oops
*prof
that also kinda reminds me of my poli prop
that's really cool
and then she talked about some of her essay works because she's ESL from china and the way they teach essay writing there isn't the same
and doesn't leave much room beyond that
it presents the idea that there is The one way to present an argument
because there's many ways of arguing a point, but the paragraphing structure is unforgiving to other ways of presenting a presentation
basically it's the idea of how do we present arguments
like the 3 point thing?
how does it tie into western logic?
._.
and it was just crickets
esp since we have international students from like china and korea
like she tried to get us to talk about using the traditional 5 paragraph format and how it ties into the propagation of western logic
aww
which is big sad
but no one wants to discuss them
she's brought up suuuuuuuuuper interesting points
sounds kinda like my russian prof
lmao
bribes us with snacks too
great prof
my prof is savage but i fucking love her
"you know class, i wouldn't say it is a bad example but it isn't perfect. it is an interesting example of using  structure though"
wait why
that's actually super interesting
my teacher lowkey roasted in front of the class tho
woo i love writing about my weird relationship with chinese and english
queen
feels good
i was the exemplar for the class's 1st real assignment
but also... rip you
my writing has been solidly consistent which i'm proud about
I'm not entirely sure how I feel about the one I wrote in delirium last night
i've written some really good things and some really trash things
which was interesting
other people did like flat earth and antivaxx
oh!
so i wrote about mccarthyism
prompt was discuss manipulative lang
what was it about?
nice nice
cranked that baby out in like 2 days
what a fun fun time
i finished my 2nd paper yesterday
but my writing this quarter was like p solid
most of my classes are curved around ~65
idk how english grading works
oooh
nursing is an interesting case bc all the tests are open note
ok the grading system here is like. it's really absurdly difficult to get above an 80 in anything, but I think a 4.0 is like ~90
my lab score is also like... not the best but it's solid
i'm scoring above average every midterm but AHHHH WHAT IS A CURVE
but ngl chem scares the bejeezus out of me
i feel pretty confident in english
yes
damn
a 4.0 is 98.5????
i need a 38+ on the test to cinch the 98.5%
i can't fucking bungle the test
lol you're gonna kill it
i'm so close to a 4.0 in that class
oh
lmao
it's a take home nursing exam tho so...
i have one next thurs
gl
yo fuck my first final is in a week
idk if there's a point right now since I'm leaving in like, 2 weeks? and REALLY need to start studying for finals. maybe next sem
lmao ily
dial 1-800-lalalalala and see what we can do for you today!
god i sound like a bad informercial
i mean if there's free resources on campus, it can't hurt to see what therapy can do for you
mmh that's fair
but it was just a general thing that's been crossing my mind, I'm not specifically asking if I should lol
tbh I don't dm people much in general I just unload all my shit here, but I should
you lowkey don't talk to me
I feel like my mental health is actually pretty good rn
i wouldn't know
mayhaps
I've also been wondering lately if I should get therapy of some kind
#problemsolving
yeah. thanks
i get that it's a difficult and complex topic, but unless the dialogue is opened then nothing will get resolved
i think talking to her would help a lot
but um yeah
i will kink shame him as much as i want
g d  i
don't kink shame salina
ahahahahaha
wtf noah
jfc
But that just makes me harder
"merle ambrose told me i was inadequate and then spit in my face and flicked me in the dick"
honestly though I feel like the root of this is a whole host of other issues relating to our collectively fucked childhood and idk if I wanna open that can of worms
hahaha
loool
I was confused how this came from Wizard 101 memes
I think I'm gonna try to talk to her in person
Ah
oh I started by mentioning I'm in a weird situation w my sister rn in a diff channel
i decided that herc was more important than you
Cause you started with the TL:DR
yes
Uh did I miss something
she's been super absent just in general though like she's in vegas rn and hasn't spoken to my parents in a long time either
you're right and I need to
staying silent about it really isn't productive
because to be honest
is there a reason why you haven't talked to her about it
literally half my closet is hand-me-downs from her, the allowance I'm getting rn is about half what she got her fresh year, and I'm gonna be working next term
yike
also she's like the last person who has a right to criticize how I spend money
like 3 months ago she was grilling me for details about my sex life while we were out camping and then she turns around and slut-shames me? like honestly I haven't even done much
I mean generally, yeah, I'm still happier than I've been in a long time, it's just weird
you doing ok?
.... oh
tl;dr during a call she said some really hurtful and hypocritical shit that has been lowkey fucking me up for almost a month now and idk how to feel about. well, everything. I basically haven't spoken to her since. first time I've genuinely been upset at her in like, several years probably. I feel like she probably hasn't even noticed I'm pissed lol but I also kinda don't wanna start shit
lmao noted. I actually need to get back to work though yikes I've. been procrastinating Big Time
Ask to see his Wizard 101 memes
Ah yes, Gabe does make much better memes
idk he's meme-ier than you but something about the way he expresses stuff feels really familiar, like it's weird
Haven't been on discord much today
Lol, didn't even notice that
he was one of the handful of people who actually took me up on the "ask me about cyberwarfare" status
Have you been talking to him recently?
<@!193229269076279298> gabe simultaneously REALLY reminds me of you when he talks but also sounds completely different and i can't explain it
Weirdest thing I’ve seen all week
Some of them are riding those small tractor-like cars with gigantic wheels, on the two back wheels
And just when a gap is about to appear a MOTORCYCLE GANG shows up
So I stood at a crosswalk for a while waiting for a gap in traffic on both sides
cars here don’t really stop for pedestrians even when they’re supposed to
*gasp*
I dropped the serving spoon into the yogurt
I’ve committed a cardinal sin
I don't think any candidate should promise to end all deportations bc tbh that's unrealistic, but Biden is really not handling this well
fuckin yikes man
https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-lashes-out-protesters-vote-for-trump-2019-11
I don't think I've ever lost something genuinely functionally important tbh
A few stuffed animals
Lots of pencils
I have also lost a LOT of shit in my life but I feel like none of it was very useful
well i doubt my parents know where the boat is either 🤷‍♀️
oh lol
nobody has to know where it is
correction
even a small inflatable boat somewhere
great then i have a tent and pretty much all camping equipment
> Does something count as lost if it’s in your house but you don’t know where it is?
sure
I’m golden
I’ve lost so much shit
Does something count as lost if it’s in your house but you don’t know where it is?
I’ve lost a couple of coats and water bottles
I bet I forgot some stuff from that
Oh actually I went to a girls summer camp in the woods and we had a survival class
I mean right now I can’t exactly describe information I forgot lmao
you get a book
Everything I remember losing is hella useless in a survival situation
How do I come up with facts and knowledge I forgot
I'd just due happy with high dota mmr
(specific facts or knowledge counts too)
(rule is for something to be considered last or forgotten, you must've had ownership of it at one point)
How do you escape
You're stranded on an island with a box containing everything you've ever lost or forgot
This is so entertaining to me for like no reason
i just remember i was super giddy/happy a lot of the time, was lazy at schoolwork due to pursuits i deemed more worthy like messing around with the class clown, reading, or watching other people's drama, and also very shy talking in front of groups or the teacher
most of my memories are when i was pissed or upset
hhhhh it's hard to remember accurate things from childhood
judging by your childhood behaviour what would you identify yourself with most strongly?
none of those seem correct but mostly because i don't see any of the opposites being inferior
ok you're proving your point about having a lot of in-between traits
kek
that would leave me with Ni, Ti, Fi
and as a kid i was the slow-to-warm-up kind of person in social situations
based on my amount of social interaction i'd say i'm an introvert
i can't tell if i'm an introvert or an extravert
as a kid i was definitely not: Fe, Si, Se
but enfp/esfp makes even less sense
i guess going back to the childhood types things might help
or maybe fi/te?
yeah idk what to make of that, that sounds like te/fi as 2nd and 3rd but neither intj or istj seem to work well overall
Fi is far from weakest
i'm definitely a lot more Fi than Fe
te si ne fi yeah? 8th function isn't your weakest
well my mom is ESTJ but she has a lot of Fe when she wants to
` am not strongly a thinker or a feeler` seems to suggest t/f as auxiliary and tertiary
the "have lots of dreams but don't achieve them" seems Ne to me
lol what if this is my debut as an ENTP
iiiiinteresting
i think my weakest function is Fe
examples: i'm often lazy but also like schedules and sometimes organization, have lots of goals/dreams but don't often achieve them, notice lots of details, am not strongly a thinker or a feeler, love and hate talking to people at alternate times, enjoy sensational things but not usually a thrill seeker, i'm not really sure what Ni is anymore and i'm not super Ne either
give some examples?
the pitfalls for me make sense too, I think as far as myself goes I am least clear on what I actually value and how to Properly Deal with Feelings re: fi as 7th/weakest. I also still don't understand what ni even is supposed to mean so. inferior? lol
i have a lot of middle-of-the-ground characteristics
i.e. I've known for a long time that I'm impulsive, detail-oriented, endlessly curious, and very deductive-reasoning-style-logical
interesting
also like, the things that are "se" and "ti" from a jungian/myers-briggs perspective were things that I identified with before I learned a lot about the functional stack
I ask bc I remember you being p indecisive on these tests, and I think you second-guessing yourself might be what's causing the confusion, but idk. and yeah definitely, I know what I like and I know what I'm like quite well I think
wbu?
i feel like i know myself well though there are some aspects that other people generally perceive differently
hmm
question, do you feel like you know yourself well?
yea ofc
I don't know many other estps
I mean I know we're both typology nerds but it's not always super precise
what the f are they even like
i think not knowing any entjs is my problem
i know too many intps
i don't think i'm intp either
idk what the fuck is wrong with my test lmao
true
the Fi questions on it were mostly about self reflection and staying true to self
moral values? what moral values
surprised I scored higher on fi than fe tbh
lol yours is very ESTP
maybe?? but I kinda doubt it
could i secretly be INTP
changed some answers
man i wish i saved past results so i could compare
btw, I seriously do Not think you're an fi dom
oh it's that one
http://www.keys2cognition.com/explore.htm
link the test?
maybe you're secretly an infp idk man
o_O
what does this even mean
no country specific squabbling
probably helps that its pretty international
And everyone wants what's best for themselves
We have the driver market, the engine suppliers, all the teams, all the teammates, the FIA, liberty media, and all car manufacturers
No it's very complicated
a classy sport in a ways
like golf but with cars
from an outside perspective formula 1 politics seems very minimal
politics themselves are not inherently bad. but lol
What's *really bad* is formula 1 politics
I know we all think American politics are bad, but no
Idk
and I think that's the better policy option both for long-term dem strategy and like, the good of the country as a whole
so we'll see what they choose. if they want to keep claiming any sort of moral high ground they need to follow through
some state legislatures that had been GOP-controlled for a really long time finally swapped to the dems in the 2019 elections. dems have long said they want to ban gerrymandering bc it's mostly been a republican tool, replace w nonpartisan system. but now they have a chance to redistrict these states in their favor
similar situation to what's happening w gerrymandering in a few states rn actually
actually that's a good point, but I think it would be hard to go back on their word after years of them railing against it
Are you implying Democrats would want to abolish it even if it benefited them?
once republicans also start losing bc of the electoral vote there will be a bipartisan push to abolish or reform
but even outside of Austin TX is becoming less white, so that's a part of it too
that's what I mean, from a winner-take-all EC standpoint
Or Austin just envelopes the entire state
it's gonna happen in our lifetimes I'm calling it now
how I see it is that the day Texas turns blue is the day the electoral college dies
the thing is, the electoral college as it is rn disproportionately benefits republicans, so rep-controlled states have p much no reason to sign on, and there aren't enough strongly democratic states to reach a majority
<@!478706068223164416> finally watched the video, it was kinda less dramatic/less of an actual solution than I'd hoped
Drink tea from shot glasses
brush teeth more
drink more tea
<@478706068223164416> is this acceptable?
Or alternatively drink tea with a straw
My dentist told me to drink less tea
I also updated my status
hello from beyond the grave
check my status
please don't dead
we call that dead
that's dead
I feel like if I fell asleep rn I could sleep indefinitely
I would love a week long nap
> ok let's have a break right now
I would love a week long break
nobody raises their hand
> show of hands of those who don't want a break right now
nobody raises their hand
> show of hands of those who want a break right now
somehow I feel like this is a poke at me for doing CS hw in class
in boolean logic
she's explaining what the differences between AND, OR, and NOT are
omfg
me in arts studies
lmao
> Alan Wen in a Twitter tweet once referred to English 131 as "a good place to learn how to look like you're working but you're not"
it'd be nice
well, fly-by citations don't really fly in hardcore academia lol
fly-by citation
my favorite
that style
whatever style is just mentioning where you got the info from in the sentence is
I use chicago for almost everything I can it's my fave by far
but we usually do get to pick
*generally* humanities prefers mla, science prefers apa, and history/poli prefers cms
mla apa or cms
(if I was better I'd make them all programming terms)
(the last 3 I listed were bs btw)
yikes man
MLA
do you guys not get to pick a style??
doesn't matter
mla, apa, ulpa, erf, sql
canada gives no fucks
lol
wait you guys get to pick a style?
I'm not annoyed that they're asking questions I'm annoyed that they keep asking p much the same thing when the prof's answer every time has basically been "search it up it depends which style you pick"
"I don't get it"
the extreme bad case of this is
if you're gonna ask a question, you should be able to formulate it in such a way that it's clear and easy to understand what you don't get
I fault people for asking questions badly
I have to disagree
don't fault people for asking questions
hey
people are asking a ton of questions about like. citation styles. which you can just google man
apparently our poli essay, which is due on mon, is somehow the first formal paper some of my classmates have written this year
I'm also really fucking bored
what do you think
`she definitely seems like the kind of person to get excited about the differences between an encyclopedia and a database`
is that supposed to be an insult?
and would trash on Wikipedia
she definitely seems like the kind of person to get excited about the differences between an encyclopedia and a database
I didn't do HL English to be told to not go on my phone during class thanks
in college
the library person literally said "I'm a stickler for phones"
EBOOKS
GALE
rip
"source analysis"
and
"concept mapping"
like
we're doing a library lab right now on super complex stuff
I feel like living here is making me more politically liberal tbh
ENGLISH
in
who's
guess
I just had a conversation w my canadian friends about how gun violence basically doesn't exist here and like I theoretically knew that but it's different hearing and experiencing it
I walked by on my way to the library and told them "wrong state"
lol, we had some of those really annoying yelling at everyone preachers at BC once
oof
It was very much an "ok boomer" sight though
Honestly, they weren't saying anything directly at me, and I didn't have the time to pick a fight with three old white dudes at once
stupidity is a right
You can respond in nonviolent ways
I mean, I can't walk up and punch them
They can say whatever they want to say but other people can react how they want to react too
Freedom of speech and whatnot, sure, but fuck their stupid asses though
Some ballsy ass Trump supporters are camped out on campus with posters saying shit like "climate change is a fraud" and "impeaching Trump would start nuclear war." They were old and white as fuck, and I'm not sure what they're expecting on a college campus in Seattle.
fun stuff
comp sci x poli sci
an election solver
basically
and update based on which states vote for or against you
it should give a list of states that you need to convince with the least number of people you need voting for you possible
make a program that can figure out how to win an election with the least amount of votes
basically
and I kinda wanna make a program to optimize this stuff
now I'm watching the 42 minute footnote
I thought that was supposed to say tk'od and tbh that seems more fitting
Same I slept away half my day
Good news is I only have 3 class hours today
Also I'm so fucking tkred lmao
lol fair
I need to get ready though no time to geek out rn
I leave the more technical bits to you
Bc yes, but also no
'a system to protect the power of the individual states' is a bit of a misnomer though
lol
and they're like "uh"
I love Grey. But anyways yeah the electoral college is wack
"so what if they decide to try to bypass it anyways?"
and his boss going
I can just see an amateur designer writing the pseudocode for this system
YES
Omgggg is this new I just woke up
is algorithmic irony and it's hilarious
that can then be used to subvert the system used to protect the power of the individual states
the idea that you designed a system to protect the power of the individual states
but from a kind of a cse standpoint
not from a polisci standpoint, that's <@!503787499605458954>'s joint
this is so funny to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUX-frlNBJY
I'm not talking "Mad Max Fury Rode" prostitution, I'm talking free market capitalism prostitution
being paid/fed/kept alive to have sex/reproduce in that time is a very different kinda gig than what prostitution is like today
I mean I guess that depends how you define "profession"
probably was the second profession ever created, right after food gatherer/hunter
sex work has been a profession for a lonnnng time
😊
lmao <@!503787499605458954> your status
some people make a profession of it
fair point lmao
that is "earning money"
I would prefer to just make my own money tbh
but like
I'm not ruling it out and I wouldn't be ashamed of it if I decided to try it
but then you have to have a certain fake personality and that's just too much work
<@!472541429130854421> that's why they have apps
<@!503787499605458954> I like all the modifiers you had to add to that
it would take too much time and effort for me to figure out how to be a sugar baby for it to be worth it to me
ah the lack of Washington minimum wage strikes
as for the sugar baby thing honestly sounds pretty nice but I'm nowhere near close to desperate enough to go looking, as of right now
for a sense of scale, a bunch of my friends here are working $10 an hour around the campus
lol, my family has ruined numbers for me
ah now i see lmao
it's got claws and stuff
but sure lol
idk if that's a crab
lol helen is your status a crab now
a few hours for a few thousand dollars?
^^
it will be a few hours at most
plus it's just sex
^
you can do a lot with a few thousand
but trust me it's very funny
listen I'll take my coin where I can get it
literally no one is gonna get that joke
really, just a couple thousand. Thank god you don't rent out cars on Turo
what's your percentage likelihood of becoming a sugar baby
reverse haggling lmao
if someone was willing to pay me for sex I would definitely negotiate the highest price possible though
I would sleep with a stranger of almost any appearance for a couple thousand, if I'm attracted to them I'd do it for free man, assuming it's all safe sane and consensual
so the less you know them the better, interesting take
oof that is problematic
I tend to keep sex pretty separate from the rest of my life? there's very few friendships I would complicate or risk by sleeping with them. also from a career standpoint, much better if they don't know or care who I am
why?
hurts
I can't tell if that helps or hurts
I care a lot less about their physical appearance and a lot more about if they know me
but the thing is
ummm
oh yikes
use the 1-10 scale as x
no no no, just give an equation then
That’s pretty common
Isn’t that just a hookup
suppose it's an average-looking person of the opposite sex who you have no connection to
Let’s set a standard individual
ok like I said depends on the other person involved man
I talked about this a while ago
we never got around to figuring out everyone's price
Lol
I'd do it too
that's fair enough
nvm
oh
wdym for the MOST part??
OoooooH
If someone offered me a million dollars though that might be a different story
"for the most part" 👀
Well...she was right for the most part 🤷🏻‍♀️
"*please*"
lol
blease
<@!472541429130854421> back me up you're not gonna blow him are you
<@!503787499605458954> that's for <@!472541429130854421> to decide not you
LMAO
well, also the truth
damn
LOL
"helen's not gonna blow him"
what about it
`helen's hot not gonna blame him`
oh?
Had a good laugh
I misread that
truth
helen's hot not gonna blame him
I have 50 mins to kill and I'm very bored in case you couldn't tell
*inhales* THE HEART WANTS WHAT IT WAAAANTS
But historically he's been *quite* into Helen
Logistically he may not want a ldr
True that
it'd be further if UW
Almost clear coast to coast
That was fast
Oh, well ok
ah ok
ASU
Yep
oh jeremy's thing
list?
*To the list*
yeah I know lol but it just occurred to me that I have no idea
Idk, but not Duke I assume
where is he again?
Or is he just looking to do stuff this break with you
Also logistically, does he really want to start a ldr?
nvm
oh that's not necessarily a thing at all
So I left that on read lol
He just said “only one month until we get back”
oooh ok
So I’m not really concerned
To be clear Jeffrey hasn’t outright invited me to hang out or anything
Lmao
lol
Nah fuck outta here with some kinda meek ass wifey girl
I'm also not saying I can only be friends with people like that, to be clear, just that it's something that will immediately draw me to a person. that kind of confidence can also be subtle and quiet, it doesn't have to be loud/in your face
Or is it just "Asian and Tall: yes"
<@173668455856340994> your thoughts
And I understand your feeling but I can't say I share it
Yea that makes sense
tl;dr confidence and competence are sexy. and it doesn't even have to be competence in a specific tangible skill, I also have massive respect for people who are just really good at bullshitting, if they know they're good at bullshitting and can project that outwards. idk if I'm explaining this well at all
I forgot to address this earlier but <@!193229269076279298> you do definitely come off as self-assured most of the time, and by that I don't mean arrogance or Always being secure and on top of shit or whatever, just that there's real belief in your own ability backing yourself up if that makes sense?
that's not what the typing was about lmao I was actually just waiting to see if you had more to say about that before changing the subject
Now <@503787499605458954> is typing up a storm
I really shouldn't have brought up music artists
But Chris Bown still has vocal public fans
But minor stuff like "talks too loud in public" isnt entirely a flaw per se
idk what's worse sexual assault or straight up assault
Like no one really defends Weinstein, he is just rich and isn't really in the spotlight any more
Well beating people is a big flaw
My real problem is how many people defend him
I hate that he's still so popular but anyways
lmaooooo
So Chris Brown's character trait is beating women, intresting take
interesting pov
Most are just character traits
I dont consider most things outright flaws
I mean big
By real
*what are his false flaws*
He brags and has a hard time admitting that he's wrong
nah bro fatal flaw maybe only flaw definitely not
*only real flaw*
*only*?
Awful bragger
In my opinion that is his only real flaw
Yes
see I'm sure there are other people who would like Jeffrey, just definitely not me. he seems nice enough. the other thing that bothers me a lot about him though is that he's awful at admitting when he can't do/doesn't know something, he always tries to fake it, which draws even more attention to his incompetence. I experienced this quite a bit when working with him in HL math, unfortunately
that was directed at `I only share porn with 2 people`
<@503787499605458954> I have no clue what that was directed at
And exceptional stuff gets sent to jiayi
not anymore
Dota buddy in Canada
I only share Porn with two people
Serious question, do you two share porn with each other
I like him quite a bit
Jeffery for all his faults is a great guy
I *come across* as very self assured in my own opinion, but feel free to correct me
<@!173668455856340994> could probably  tell you better than I
Well you yourself are also very self assured
programming, anime
for the sake of fairness, I know that as far as my own people preferences go, I strongly gravitate towards people who come off as self-assured, so my assessment of his insecurity may be overly harsh
Other than chasing uninterested girls that is
What does he like?
the *pretty in general* part is not for me to decide
he's pretty passionate about what he likes as well
on the defense of jeffery for the sake of fairness
great, mission accomplished lmao
Acceptable, your life shall be spared in the future
I'm aware, thank you very much
ladies you're both pretty
better??
ok, you're smart and both passionate and, as far as I can tell, good at engineering
I do love the modifiers "*pretty* smart" and "*passionate* about engineering"
and LMAO sorry point being, I make fun of Salina and you two in general a lot but I respect her choice and consider you a good friend + cool person
I meant, you're pretty smart and clearly passionate about engineering
What does `And reasonably competent at what you do` even mean?
No I'm not sure how I feel
`At least you're pretty`
Ok I was gonna say, if that's all you had to say then I'm pretty insulted
And reasonably competent at what you do
At least you're pretty
Yea, endish Sophomore year
Also yeah I have 0 clue why she was into him no offense
When???
Wait you asked Laura out?????
And yet I still got turned down by Laura and he didn't
I hope he's gotten better I guess. I mostly felt bad for him but didn't ever want to interact w him
I'm pretty sure I've already talked about why I don't like him, btw, from his very obvious desperation in chasing several obviously uninterested girls to how everything is a sob story and nothing is ever his fault
idk man you didn't suffer through witnessing him every day at lunch
well, that was definitely the impression I got throughout almost the entirety of senior year, and to me, the random "we should meet up" sounds like classic desperation
I thought he just asked her out?
Does he?
jeffrey seems really hung up on her tbh so I think best course of action is just to say no
ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
No no no, the third one makes you feel bad for a while but then you forget and it's all ok
the third one is by far the worst one
3) no response
2) no
1) yes
there's three responses that a guy can get when he asks a girl to hang out
yeah just tell him no
Anyway, back to the current problem
lmao
no. stop.

hm what triggered that

basically, you have 4 options:
a) suck it up and hang out w him, at risk of drawing out his unfortunate crush
b) ghost him
c) leave him on read
d) state in no uncertain terms that you don't want to meet up
Bruh just shoot him down
gdi noah
No just be me, open them still but just never reply
Lol
I never accepted his friend request on snap lmao
that works too
I’m gonna just not open his snaps from now on
you say straight up that you don't want to
You accept your fate as sealed
You don't
I don’t dislike him but also don’t want to spend time with him if that makes any sense
How do I get myself out of this one
Oh god I think he’s trying to meet up during winter break
I like Jeffrey, from my very limited conversation with him
<:KZ:607334139493875760>
Maybe don't
"Man we really shoulda went out during highschool"
Start fucking with him
lol okay he seems fine then
That's sus. Did you say anything?
I mostly just find this very humorous
He literally said “Hi” then dropped off the face of the earth lmao
Did he just conversationally message you or did he ask for something specific?
should I go be his friend for a bit
is he getting lonely
oh god
No
Does he go to your school?
My guess is no
Why is Jeffrey Li messaging me again

I think you should be fine either way though
That's weirdly binary
This is kinda ridiculous
I had a blast
I know when I was a kid I would watch naruto videos on youtube
But like wtf kids watch anime too
I guess I'll be safe and set it to this
Most of their videos are about like cool technology and cute animal things that show up in our daily lives, but they also upload stuff like what a tank firing range sounds like, or what a gun shooting ice looks like
Or channels like The Daily Dose of Internet, a relatively harmless channel, that uploads daily with interesting videos
Like some infographic shows
There are really good channels out there that upload some interesting and insightful videos, that maybe cover some more sensitive material, but they do it in a respectful and interesting manner
And it's also confusing like what is for kids? I make anime videos, but none of the stuff is particularly 18+ material
I'm just not sure if this would actually be effective at all
I guess people at the head of youtube recognize how poorly a lot of stuff online influences kids
And if a channel is marked as "for kids" but makes content that would be like violent or sexual or anything, they can actually be fined
So youtube is doing this thing where creators have to mark their channels as "for kids" or "not for kids", probably to filter out what kids can or cannot see on youtube

`I wonder what they did to straight people lol`
this but no context
I wonder what they did to straight people lol
the survey this lab visit was nearly identical to the first, they're comparing control variation in responses (no password) to changes in response from people who had the password, predicting that the people who had the password would display lower levels of internalized homophobia afterwards
but apparently one of the specific things they were looking at was internalized homophobia, and the password was supposed to be about some of your personal values, and by making you type it a few times a day it was supposed to be a subtle form of self-affirmation intervention which theoretically decreases your self-hatred lmao
the password thing was the caveat that threw me for a loop, if anyone remembers me talking about that
also it was p much what I expected, measured social integration, psychological well-being, and mental health vs. sexual orientation and any negative experiences related to sexuality
yayyyyy
ya girl got that bread
I’m curious about it too
Ooh fun!
getting paid today and also gonna find out what it was actually about. Highkey excited
about to go into my second lab session for that psychology study I volunteered for
Lol
(Tanglish is my mom's family's mix of Cambodian, Cantonese, Mandarin, Vietnamese, and English)
he def knows more than me/speaks more Tanglish than I do
but not enough to negotiate a club fundraising deal
the funny part is he knows enough Cantonese to order in Cantonese
Hahahaha
I suggested he ask Chin (2nd eldest, climbed Rainer) to help translate
like we were discussing how to order dim sum from a place for a fundraiser
but it's fine since I get to tease him occasianally
Lol
that's one hell of a farce
because he forgot and he needs them in 5 minutes
like running to the store to buy 60 solo cups
What if that’s his real personality and how he acts around you is a farce
he gets to make me run the dirty work
but then on the flip side
but yeah he's usually quieter around us so it's funny seeing him act open and leaderly at the meetings
Ohhh
^ answer
||hey wanna get fried rice||

it's funny getting to see Damond try and act leaderly and professional
thanks lol
<@!258094439636008971> do it
and well hey nice i'm proud of you dude
Nice!
I'm an official General Officer as of last week
Oh lol

wow look at you such a leader
us three became officers and one guy that was on the fence
two other officers got double 8s and the rest were 5-7
lol
ouch
NO I COULD TOTALLY LEAD SASE
ouch
is that what you were going for?
slightly miffed but okay
> potential to be a P/VP
not
look at you go

damn son
oh hey that's good right
spicy
I found my interview
I weasled my way into SASE's officer interview archives
Well the absolute worst is to eat a frozen unthawed pizza so you still have a ways to fall
ok some people like that and i won't judge
but you won't ask for cold pizza at a restaurante
cold pizza tho
i agree with salina
so im gonna go with the first definition
and theyre wrong
<@!520095106888630348> and in casual american cuisine, many people would consider room-temperature pizza extraordinarily fine
scurrrrrrvy
gi infection
botulism
food poisoning
which definition
hardly a delicacy, but classic American is correct
I'm not denying that pizza can be best hot. I'm simply stating that it's a classic American delicacy when served at room temperature.
Hell yeah that sounds great
How bout we meet up for lunch
Pizza sounds good right about now
ugh I want pizza
pizza is best when it's hot enough to burn your mouth but tasty enough for you to eat it anyways
pizza is best right out of the oven
it's not The Worst but it's not Good either
Room-temperature pizza is an American delicacy. Change my mind.

Relationships? Who?
In conclusion: relationships are difficult
Yeah in conclusion, a romantic partner is just a friend who you want to bang
Jarrett I feel like I recognize lots of these words
So higher success rate if you start with friendship
So if y'all can already be great friends then that gets most of the problems out of the way
But relationships a good portion just an extension of friendship
You can totally meet people with the intention to date them and have it turn out fine
Hmmmm amendment
I think a good relationship should be a friendship first and foremost, whether it starts out with it or develops it is a personal thing
A good relationship begins with a good friendship
we're talking about love and sexuality and shit in soci
never said they weren't, I was just curious as to whether or not y'all had a preference
Eh both are valid
random question that just occurred to me, do y'all think it's better to be friends w someone before dating them or to meet them intending to date them (i.e. online stuff, mixers/speed dating events)
My dad has heard me describe things as “shitty” before
That's p lit actually
his mom called his dad dude one time
cool parents
his mom is quite energetic
I mean, I can probably swear like a sailor around Scott and Courtney, and they're pretty much my parents at this point too
nobody batted an eye
I swore several times
meanwhile <@173668455856340994> got to meet my parents today
But in all fairness, I was talking about UW's college of engineering and their experimental major placement system, so I feel like that warrented "fucking" as an adjective
They both looked at each other when it happened
Accidentally swore in from my parents for the first time today
So tea-worthy life update

He's defo not general white
He's Italian too
That's fair enough
I'm not making fun of him for having asian friends, I'm making fun of his relative whiteness, but sure, I'll stop if it's actually offensive
I wouldn't give him too much shit for having a lot of Asian friends, even jokingly
Well now that's a wide ass net
Y'all need to meet some certified White People^tm
again, I'm not being super serious
-_-
is europe not mostly white? that's news to me
^
I did live and travel around all of mainland Europe for 3 years you know
Uh <@503787499605458954> I just like Mexican food the most
(Noah knows who I'm talking about)
Like, American pizza
I know some folks whose most exotic food they're familiar with is pizza.
Granted, I know Trademarked Michigan White Budget Frat Boys, but my point still stands
idk, the most exotic food he's familiar with is mexican
In Noah's defense, he is far from being super white
To be clear this isn't a judge of character but I will 100% make fun of you for it
Noah is easily the whitest person I've ever seen be friends with tons of Asians
therefore bias
he can't use chopsticks
<@193229269076279298> your opinion?
But you can often find out that all the token white friends we hang out with have to at least be able to use chopsticks
My answer is no, that's not how that works
But are you really accepted by them unless you can surpass the wall of the chopstick?
Like sure, you can hang out with your Asian friend and his Asian friends and get along
Is the border to entry for hanging out with a group of Asian people the ability to use chopsticks
I have so much to say about all of this man I could go on for hours but I'll chill lmao
a lot of political theory traces back to the question of human nature. I guess my opinion can best be summed up as "naturally free-thinking but very malleable to ideas/ideologies and also very tribal"
a lot of people say that the milgram experiment confirms that people are basically sheep to authority but that's actually a HUGE oversimplification of the experiment's findings. what it really found was that people are willing to go to extreme lengths for a cause they believe in (in that case, science) but as soon as they were told they had no choice, they rebelled
objectively he was a very talented leader. idk if that says the population was full of shitty people, that people in general are shit, or just that people are easily led
and directed it towards vulnerable populations
hitler capitalized on a moment of the country's weakness and channeled their anger
I wouldn't even say a majority did pre-hitler like yeah antisemitism was a thing but there had been german jews living peacefully there my man
it's not like literally every german actually hated the jews etc
well
And it doesn't stop a large population of shitty people supporting a shitty leader
see the question then becomes suppose the whole world is democratic, how do you stop it from breaking down?? again, in theory you should be able to get rid of these kinds of leaders, but it takes a lot to build a system where that actually functions
Using the good old Hitler was democratically elected angle
yeah for sure
I think a lot of countries would just be in agreement that they hate other countries/people
idk
and corruption can and will still happen but the whole point is that you can Get Rid of the corrupt leaders, at least in theory. see: Trump & impeachment
I don't doubt that there would still be tons of conflicts, peoples' national interests will still clash, and I'm sure there would still be human rights abuses (one of the reasons aristotle actually disliked the concept of majority rule) but I think we would be in a very different scenario if ordinary citizens everywhere were empowered to speak up, mobilize, use their democratic rights and freedoms
nor am I saying democracy is a perfect system, but I fundamentally disagree with the idea that if every country was truly democratic, it wouldn't change what the world looks like
like if you polled China right now, they'd probably vote to keep the Communist party in control. but then consider that they've spent decades basically indoctrinating the population
respecting self-determination is important (see: Vietnam) but that comes with a lot of caveats as well
so I guess I think we should aspire towards every country becoming a stable democracy of sorts. do I believe in forcibly exporting it? I don't think anyone really does post-Iraq
it's not a mistake that every stable country in the world rn is governed by either some form of democracy/republic or through authoritarian/totalitarian control
I'm not saying it's infallible, it's actually really terrifyingly fragile
democracy HAS been overthrown in a number of cases and it's almost always replaced with something objectively worse for the people of the country. also in a lot of cases by the time it's being overthrown it's not really a functioning democracy anymore
not to be a nerd and quote Churchill again, but like, it is in fact the worst system aside from everything else we've ever tried
at least, by far the best we've come up with so far
the more research I've done and political theory I've learned, tbh, the more I've been convinced that democracy pretty much IS the best form of government
thanks all for your contributions
ok I was busy till now and forgot to respond to this earlier
satyagraha
but... but...
And Gandhi nukes the entire world
That's when you get an integer underflow error
lmao
wow
that's some Poli Sci x Comp Sci stuff
because computing is the future
and have thousands of computers run the games
imagine a game of civ 5 except you apply the scientific method
an interesting way to help speed up the experimentation of governmental bodies is to run simulations
but it's not gonna be what we have now
I don't know What Will Be
I don't believe Democracy will be the most popular form of government in 1000 years
if you want an idea of how that idea works in philosophy
basically nobody's ever happy
it takes experimentation to find out what kind of system best suits a people, and even then that system will change over time as the people change
so government shutdowns, rebellions, revolutions, overthrows, coups, and more are all just part of the growing pains of a country's government as a whole
Its the best because that’s what we are
basically, the only way to find out of a type of government sticks is to apply it and see if anything falls apart
my argument: because it hasn't been overthrown yet
how did democracy come to be recognized (at least here) as the "best form of government"?
> what do you believe are viable alternatives then?
I won't try to propose a solution for every situation (because that undermines my argument -- there is no one perfect solution) but I will outline a way to find out: trial and error.
My personal opinion is, the best way to spread democracy “safely” is,
1) identify a nation where there is a problem between the government and the citizens, I.e. gov isn’t protecting citizen rights or citizens are generally not satisfied
2) somehow plant the idea of democracy in some citizens and see if the idea catches on,
3) if a large portion of the citizens are ready for and agree with having a democracy then they can start a revolution 
4) if a very large portion of the citizens want a democracy but the existing government is using oppressive tactics to stop them then we can intervene to help the rebellion
Good luck with your essay
Sorry I can't elaborate more though cuz I kinda gotta go work on my design project lol
There just needs to be some form of stable government that the people genuinely support, has effective transitions of power, and isn't really problematic in gaining its citizens' trust. I don't have any examples of how to go about that other than democracy because of my limited knowledge and perspective, but if there's another way, I'm all for it
so if you've got something to say I'd appreciate it v much
also during class I focused on surveying international kids and didn't get a US perspective
Inventing a mind machine so everyone all around the world will agree
technically this is for an essay but the essay is based around collecting a ton of opinions and analyzing all of them and it's just something I'm v curious about bc it is complicated
i wholeheartedly concur
i agree
Salina as dictator
heat death of the earth
death
what do you believe are viable alternatives then?
and in super short -- it's complicated
I think the idea of "spreading an idea because we think it's the right one" is dangerous because it's the driving idea behind the crusades
personal side opinion
**No**
Differences in culture, environment, and philosophy differ wildly around the world. Imposing ("spreading") democracy on each and every one of them is like trying a "one-size-fits-all" solution on the most variable and changing things known to mankind -- man itself. In short, democracy can't be the best form of government for the entire world because the entire world demands a variety of solutions for its variety of peoples.
lemme make an easily digestable response hold on
for an essay?
so what should we do to help those under regimes that regularly commit human rights abuses, etc? should we intervene at all?
truthfully i legit don't think spreading democracy will change that much in the world
my coffee cup has been making screaming sounds so i don't have to
i mean have you seen my status
but in a lot of ways yes, defeatist
i'm not saying there isn't potential for positive change
isn't that kind of defeatist though?
thank you for speaking
thank you for coming to my ted talk
because a lot of the undemocratic countries are known for having a very closed society that don't really give a damn about what certain groups/ppls/leaders say
changing the government structure will, in many outcomes, result in a lot of the same-same
but the cultural beliefs ingrained into society run deep
sure it requires more finangling than dictatorship now
corruption can still occur in both forms of democracy and essentially still uphold strongman status in countries that rely on authoritarian rule
even if you change the structure of gov, you don't necessarily change the structure of culture
here's the thing though
lol true
because it can go to the shitter both ways
okay
and I left it purposefully vague, could be either
ye
when you say "actual democracy democracy" I assume you're referring to direct
or our representative kind of bullshit
are we talking about actual democracy democracy
question
qait
because if we say "it'd make countries so much better"

do you believe that democracy should be spread around the world?

My dad just got the same haircut as me and I dont know how to feel
nah, eating advil like candy is even more fun
i decided that committing unsolvable crimes are more fun
depression
what happened in these few moments
helen you went from washing your face to petty theft
i highkey just stole an entire roll of trash bags from the cleaning closet
So yes
The outer coating is sugar
Is it just me or does Advil taste like candy
You’ve got some major depresso to work on
Get to work rookie
Yeah
I should start sending snaps of black screens saying how sad I am
I know
Aw poor you
I also look locked out
I do look depressed af right now
New lows my dude
No human contact
Aside from that
And only one person has asked me if I was okay
Wow
Hahaha
Honestly I can see myself doing all my math out here from now on
Hallways are underrated as hell
Outlook’s calendar integration functions are so good for setting up meetings with people
Google is more for regular people
Outlook is amazing for business/work emails
I really wish so too, but I get why that can happen
I wish you could change your @
lol rip
My Google Drive is attached to ihasastupid@gmail.com, and that's a really awkward email to give to college students I've never met when doing group projects
see the problem is my student email has a horrible UI and my gmail has been my spam email for so long, yet I use that google account for everything else
Outlook is p solid these days, but Google still is lightyears ahead
It's also my "if I give you this email, I don't really wanna talk to you" email
I'm slowly trying to migrate away from it, and it's slowly becoming my spam email
aye
Wang Gang
.....secret twins?
omg it's another one
Same actually
to be fair I'm one of like 5 people in the world who still use an @hotmail
wow
I think my parents were still using AOL up until like a year or two ago
microsoft, why
Right??
ok it PISSES me off that if you log out of outlook it redirects you to MSN lmfao
I haven't even read shit there, but from the few times Outlook has accidentally misdirected me there and I've seen their front page a few times, yiiiiiike that's a lot of clickbait
Honestly, yeah
MSN is wack
Also, they straight up just told me that their two main sources of news are WSJ and MSN (I forgot this shit was still a thing, but don't tell them cuz I don't want them to feel old),. They're also the type to call literally everything "fake news" and believes WSJ leans left, but they're effectively the classic harmless politically confusing yet extraordinarily sweet old couple at this point. They're not registered to vote or talk about politics with anyone who doesn't already understand where they're at, so I guess they're not hurting anyone.
Honestly, I don't read the news nearly as often as I should. Ever since high school ended, I realized I've been a lot less globally/politically aware than I used to be, so I recognize that as a problem
and I think it's just really Good For You to read/absorb a variety of things to be able to make educated decisions
idk like I'm not expecting people to maintain the level of current-event-scrutiny that I do, I'm aware that most people don't find it Fun and like I'm majoring in a field of polisci, but if you read like 2 articles a day or listen to a podcast a day or something you're probably already more aware than like half the people in this country
But I have access to it for free, and my parents read it, so I'll check it out here and there
And I also had trouble focusing on that kind of stuff for a full article as a kid lol
Their econ/business stuff is pretty solid from what I remember, but I'm not super well versed in that.
I still check it from time to time for opposing side reference
I do think it's pretty valuable to check in for more right-leaning and business-centric stuff though
Honestly, I'm aware of that, and it makes me uncomfortable that it's my parents' main news source
for clarification, I don't have subscriptions to any of these
not to say it's bad by any means, but they've gotten a lot of flack for leaning pro-trump in recent years
WSJ probably has the worst fact-check record of the highly prestigious news sources tbh
This is a deep-running problem that sincerely bothers me
lmao
Which is a very petty reason
Although I can't bring myself to regularly read WSJ regularly since it kinda scarred me for life as a kid when my parents tried to force me to read it daily when they thought I was struggling with reading/writing
Idk if it's actually worth subscribing to NYT then. I kinda have a lot of subscriptions as is.
News/politics-based subreddits in a nutshell
it's gotten worse in the internet age, outrage is def the feeling that produces the most clicks and shares
Yay
everyone is they target you psychologically lmao
(it's not a good thing)
But I'm a sucker for clickbait titles. It's been a secret weakness lol.
Ok, yeah, the emotionally-charged headlines things is def something I've noticed
PLEASE RESUME DISCUSSION
THIS IS THE END OF THE TECHNICAL INTERRUPTION
I thought so but I never bothered to check
ah
oooh go off
they use your ip
HELLO INTERRUPTING TECHNICAL EXPLAINATION OF HOW PAYWALLS TRACK YOU IN INCOGNITO
also they use a lot of emotionally-loaded headlines
they've published some fake stuff pretty recently, forced to apologize for a few gaffes
What happened?
I used to like NYT a lot more than I do now
tbh though I prefer smaller/more independent sources, personally
How do they count the incognito thing? IP address?
Also, damn, I always liked NYT
WaPost is the main thing I still use it for for unlimited
I'm pretty sure NYT incognito gives you 3 more free, but it doesn't reset the counter
The Seattle Times has decent Mariners coverage. I don't really go to it for the news.
I guess I have free access to WSJ cuz my parents stole my student discount credentials for that lmao
so idk
I don't really read the seattle times lol
some companies are getting smarter about it
Does incognito mode actually get past paywalls? Cuz for some reason, I've always struggled to get past Seattle Times paywalls even via incognito mode.
Genuinely, thanks for the various sources. I've been meaning to look for more news sources recently.
can you tell I like politics lmao
I can't believe how much I just wrote about that
I've recently gotten back into podcasts too if that's your thing, 538 politics is great and also pretty entertaining, I like KCRW's "left right & center" for conflicting perspectives on issues, vox's "today, explained" is a solid place to start if you're overwhelmed by everything but want a daily update (though again keep in mind, liberal bias)
yeah it is a bit of effort to be educated about what goes on in the world, but imo it's super worth it to just be Knowledgeable and Aware and be able to vote smartly. and this is the stuff I do when I'm just like standing in line or waiting for some shit, so I feel like I'm putting that time to good use
if you're reading something and you're not sure how reliable the source is you can always check on https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/
other reliable sources: the atlantic, vox, the guardian, bbc, npr (most of these have a liberal bias but all have an extremely good track record for factual reporting)
protip: there's 2 things you can do to get around paywalls. one is to refresh and cancel the refresh before the pop-up loads. the other is to use incognito mode to open articles, the counter usually resets each time. I actually kinda hate myself for doing this because supporting journalism is super important but also ya girl is poor and wants to be informed
do note that NYT and WaPost have a pretty clear liberal bias, WSJ has a pretty clear conservative bias, and all have published at least a few Questionable things (failed fact-checks)
NYT and WaPost (could maybe throw in WSJ on the conservative side) are probably the most famous/prestigious/historically relevant sources (see: watergate) and are usually the sources Important People (see: house dems, Mitch McConnell) will turn to when they want to make a dramatic/important public statement (usually an op-ed about their stance, see: impeachment, Syria)
I also read a lot of foreign policy and foreign affairs for world news but that's like My Thing and most people don't care
as for how I follow the news, imo https://fivethirtyeight.com/ does the best election coverage by far. really great if you like numbers, they do the best polling and poll compilations (and of pretty much any news source, they were most correct in 2016. the NYT gave clinton a 99% chance of winning; 538 gave 70), have never failed a fact check, and their politics pieces are always excellently sourced
so right now I guess I'm kinda at "hope something truly catastrophic hits the Trump admin and republicans brave the civil war that would be needed to take him down"
so those are my top 3 picks I guess? again, depressingly, I think any of those 3 would have a better shot at winning against Trump than any of the 3 actual frontrunners. if Harris solidified her policy proposals, she could be a really strong candidate. she has this no-bullshit attitude that I like a lot and she's great at working a crowd. despite my doubts about an openly gay candidate, Buttigieg is an extremely compelling speaker and has done a fantastic job of positioning himself as a moderate alternative. Yang would definitely be the hardest for Trump to attack, and has a lot of ideas that appeal directly to the kinds of frustrated middle-class voters who won the presidency for Trump in 2016
I'm liking Andrew Yang more and more the more I listen to what he's got to say, he's just a really cool dude and I think I've mentioned that thank fuck SOMEONE is talking about the shitstorm that's about to hit the global economy. as of right now though, I feel like his chances are pretty microscopic, and I'm not entirely sold on UBI yet (though he makes a compelling case)
I like Buttigieg and he's been just as consistent as Warren in debates, the only other candidate who's been steadily rising, which is actually great. but I also don't think America would elect a gay president, which is depressing to say in 2019 but I mean, consider that our electoral system heavily advantages rural conservatives
she's trying to position herself between the leftist progressive (sanders, warren) wing of the party and the moderate centrists (biden) but it's resulted in a bit of a mess. she hasn't defined herself very well
I like Harris and she was my fave at the beginning of this race, but her campaign has been honestly pathetic so far after some good moments early on
moreso because the dem electorate seems to be pretty focused on the idea of electability and beating trump but is also leaning towards people I think would obviously lose?? maybe I'm being extra cynical but a Lot of analysts have similar opinions
of the dem candidates who i think would actually have a good shot of beating trump in a straight match-up, like none have a good shot of winning the nomination, which is really frustrating
anyways I brought up 2020 bc I really wanna work on a campaign team again next summer but I have no idea who to support at this point
"an hour later" I mean
"in a sec" I say
god i wish
Four-year government shutdown 😃
"let's not elect a president and just chill for four years"
on the platform
gonna run for pres
Biden gonna do a Hillary part 2 if he gets the nomination
sorry I'll be back in a sec I'm calling my parents
Let’s settle for a compromise of 55
they shit on young candidates for not being experienced tho
Lol we need some 40 year old presidents
It's kinda high key bombing
he's been getting shit on for seeming confused and not completely together
biden has been lowkey bombing debates
top 4 if you include Trump as the rep nominee
slight tangent, I think it's deeply problematic that our top 3 are all over the age of 70
Bernie's a weird beast. I think his chances of getting nominated are basically nonexistent tbh, even though he's polling quite a bit higher than the rest of the field (the gap between the 2 frontrunners and his 3rd place is pretty significant though), if only because I think the DNC would straight up reject him for being:
-explicitly anti-establishment
-backed by other Very Aggressively Progressive dems who are also explicitly anti-establishment (see: AOC's "squad")
-too fucking old?? he had a heart attack??????
which definitely will not fly if she gets the nomination, I think. I actually think she has a better shot against Trump than Biden though
like straight up she might be doing well in a white, liberal, "woke" dem electorate but she champions policy that's broadly unpopular, and her strategy seems to have been to avoid talking about the downsides (i.e. refusing to say that her healthcare plan will raise taxes on the middle class despite everyone Knowing that's the only way it's gonna work)
so next we have Warren. I initially had an extremely negative view of her, not gonna lie. the whole Pocahontas scandal was actually a valid thing for Trump to attack her on imo (basically she claimed native american heritage based on "family stories" or smth to say she was a minority, then took a dna test and it was a completely negligible %) and I think in a match-up against Trump he's definitely gonna revive that. I will give her that she's extremely charismatic, a consistently good debater, inspires a lot of passion. I like her quite a bit more now than before. My and most of the general electorate's problem with her is that she's too far left
Nigh nonexistent
But his message is bad
His platform is very clear cut and consistent
Ah bad choice of wording
he has much clearer positions than a lot of other candidates
read his platform
ok that's not true
Which is a shite platform
His whole platform is "I'm not Trump"
Biden doesn't stand for shit
Problem is
I'll talk about what I do to follow news after I'm done explaining the candidates
it's so weird that the Trump kids are complaining about Hunter Biden getting stuff for being Biden's son
ok so that's my very summarized hot take on Biden
also while the Ukraine allegations Trump is throwing at him are mostly false, the thing with his son getting onto the Ukrainian company's board because they wanted to look like they had ties to the US gov still raises questions about corruption and nepotism (it's basically the same problem as Trump's kids getting high positions because they're Trumps...)
no one's that enthusiastic
yeah that's why i'm surprised he's still a frontrunner
so basically he doesn't muster much enthusiasm, which makes sense, bc come on, he's another old white guy who literally represents a return to the pre-trump status quo
i watch youtube clips a lot
occasionally i read articles about important things like Syria and Hong Kong
he's lagging in fundraising and people seem to be coalescing behind him because they view him as the most "electable" option (especially black voters, who as a group tend to be more pragmatic in the dem electorate, despite Biden's complicated history on racial issues)
Idk how to follow, all I know how to do is read New York Times summaries on the candidates and I’m about to run out of free articles
i should probably know more but that takes a lot of time
i'm following as much as i can but i feel like i don't know a lot of the details
he's an awful debater, he's made claims that he's gonna "beat Trump like a drum" when pretty much all signs point towards the opposite being the case in that match-up
his family drama is Intense, his son is struggling to recover from addiction/substance abuse, and I really feel for the dude tbh but I really wish he would just drop out or that he didn't declare in the first place
not many people know this but Biden is in a really shitty personal life space rn
anyways. as I said on snap I am like 70% sure Trump can beat any of the 3
I have 0 clue how much you guys are following the current political news but I HIGHLY recommend that you do because we're literally living through historical shit going down
Biden came in as a clear (by percent) but kinda shaky (his campaign has been VERY weak so far imo) frontrunner, Warren has been gaining steadily, Bernie has been stable the whole time but is having issues appealing to voters outside of his existing hardcore base
I thought he fell behind
Biden still??
Biden & Warren are pretty much neck and neck
<@!472541429130854421> so currently the 3 frontrunners are Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders, in that order
Awww, thank you, Cindy
also I'm proud of you
first of all I'm beyond impressed at the rate of your hair growth
I just shaved for the first time since coming to college lmao
So it'd also prob still hurt their reelection chances
The problem is that even politically aware Americans don't care about foreign policy :(
But idk, if they do, they're almost definitely gonna lose the presidency
Tbh I feel like the Syria debacle might be a catalyst for reps to start turning on Trump in the impeachment battle
I'm shook
Did anyone read Mitch McConnell's Syria piece in the WaPost
We were voted best city in the world to live in by Time magazine
i blame your family for this btw
noah
wow
Kinda crazy
Apparently Sammamish is by several measures the richest city (65,000+ people) in the country
Completely different note
Smash Bros
maybe that's where my extra testosterone goes into
and is extremely aggressive in smash
speaking, again, as a high testosterone male who uses vanilla scented body wash and enjoys a cup of tea over manga
that's a good way to put it
The science isn't clear and this is my personal opinion, again. But like I kinda think that it's the deviation from norm of the hormone that matters behaviorally and not the levels themselves. I guess I do kinda believe that in theory people are blank slates at birth, though genetically inclined towards certain behaviors, and are ultimately shaped by society
Like I'm pretty sure I have higher testosterone than the avg female i.e. Im quite hairy for an Asian girl, deeper voice than most girls, have always been pretty aggressive, etc. Obviously less than the avg male, but it manifests in "maler" traits. There's a lot of guys with more testosterone and less estrogen than me but also have higher estrogen than avg for guys who have a lot more "feminine" traits
See like I think the estrogen testosterone thing is also relative. Like genetics play a role in personality but I suspect that they don't really matter except in comparison to levels normal to your sex if that makes sense?
but yeah basically I agree
wasn't targeted at anyone in particular, just throwing my five cents in
hey it's been exactly 11 hours
`I'm not denying that there are biological differences between girls and guys but I also think this idea gets exaggerated`
a guy born with too much testosterone and has had fights with it
signed
manners and adhering to expectations
aka
and replace them with what society deems to be "the correct way"
therefore, we've been taught to suppress these instinctive tendencies
we're civilized peoples
because we're not fucking apes
but choosing whether or not to act as a result of those effects really comes down to the society you're in and your experiences as a child
it has behavioral effects
testosterone is a thing
I do believe there is some merit to the "biological differences" side of things, but I agree that societal and parental expectations play the primary role
i had to read about 10 words of it to get what you were saying lol
nah it was very clear to me
I feel like I have a hard time explaining this opinion
oh huh I don't remember that
just in a different context
i've heard you say it before
yeah it does make sense
did my rant even make sense
lol
i think at this point it's always going to be my favorite color
yay i like pink 😄
Idk I could go on about this. I don't think girls are naturally more empathetic or less violent, boys are just taught to repress their emotions and girls are taught to be less aggressive and/or express violence in different ways, etc etc etc etc. Of course it's just my opinion but I feel like the idea makes a lot of sense. I'm not denying that there are biological differences between girls and guys but I also think this idea gets exaggerated because inequalities in how we treat girls and guys from the beginning that aren't necessarily obvious or "oppressive" get overlooked and gives us what looks like more "inherent differences"
Like why do more girls like the color pink? Because society has for some reason assigned pink to the female sex and it gets shoved into our faces practically as soon as we're born. Think of all the baby balloons and toys and blankets and shit. Why do fewer boys like the color pink? Because they've associated it with femininity for as long as they can remember
So to summarize I guess, my hot take is that he's right about equality vs. equity but wrong about when we achieve equality. Equality flat-out doesn't exist in our current society, and it disadvantages both sexes in different ways. I think very few of the stereotypical feminine traits are a result of biology; I think it's mostly a result of thousands of years of tradition and societal conditioning
Of course some women do that too but at least from what I've seen, and a lot of data suggests, women are more likely to "follow their passions" that may or may not be stem-related, and I think this is often a result of women - consciously or subconsciously - being less expected to be able to support a full family by themselves
I think a lot more men go into CS for the wrong reasons i.e. it's an easy way to achieve high stable income right out of college
Like take the whole "women who are just as good at science but also good at verbal stuff will explore other career options versus men choose stem" bit. I feel like this is because society conditions us to think of men as breadwinners, and often gives women the option of marrying A Man and thus Not being required to be the breadwinner
I really don't buy that the two sexes have inherently different interests because of what genitals we're born with or "biological differences", I think it appears that way because parents and every society on this planet still treats their kids very differently, from birth, based on what genitals they're born with
I think he approached the topic in a pretty respectful manner considering the touchy subject, and I do agree with a good number of his points, but I fundamentally disagree with a good number as well.

I don't think it's nearly as simple as "boys and girls are different", and he admits himself that "it's complicated." I don't fully agree with what he calls the Oppression Narrative, though it can't be denied that for many many years women were in fact excluded and/or discriminated against and are still in many ways today. I don't agree with what seems to be a kind of defeatist attitude on his part either. I recognize that as a prof at these high-level unis, he has personally made a lot of contributions to gender equality in tech, and I really respect that.

That aside, I don't think we're stuck at 30-70 forever. I just also don't think "diversity programs" are necessarily the way to correct that. I don't really believe in preferential treatment for girls (or any disadvantaged group in any scenario, which is why I've often struggled with where I land on the issue of affirmative action) - this is one of the VERY few points I agree with Damore on, that "counter-discrimination" as he and a lot of men call it, is harmful to business because it undermines meritocracy. I do strongly believe that women (and other disadvantaged groups, etc) should be treated equally, in every sense of the word. Unfortunately, this is very much a normative ("ought to be") standpoint, has literally never been achieved in practice, and I don't think is possible to achieve in practice until society at large basically completely reforms how it raises children and treats the two sexes as a whole.
it's interesting that the ratio is at a constant 30-70
I have a lot of thoughts. most of them are tied to the opinion I already stated above but I don't think I was very clear on that
"Inclusion is about culture, and in a twist worthy of Orwell, inclusion often demands the exclusion of ideas and opinions." this I really like
one line in particular caught my attention -- "the entire goal of achieving gender diversity makes no sense unless you believe that men and women work in fundamentally different ways"
i thought the way this was written was, not to sound pretentions, very enlightening (lol)
if we were ever to actually eliminate those differences I think we would be much closer to equity
like I think a lot of the differences in interests between the sexes can be traced back to how we raise boys and girls differently
I agree with him on equality vs. equity, but I also think that if we as a society ever truly reach equality equity will probably come with it
also my professor for CSE143X
the author is a principal lecturer at UW, specifically the director of introductory cs courses in the Allen School
lemme reiterate
i have no idea who damore is, and i think the author of this article at times says some sketchy things but i agree with his reasoning
ok I just started reading but I'm ngl I immediately distrust his sympathy towards Damore
disclaimer, i generally don't like organizations that are "for women, by women" as a way of encouraging feminism so my opinion is at least in some way influenced by indignant feelings
so basically this article affirms most of my opinions
it's definitely very interesting. Whenever i hear messages for girls in stem and stuff i tend to be doubtful that the male to female ratio in tech is concerning and is actually due to oppression
i just finished reading the article
I will respond prob in like half an hour I'm gonna force myself to finish this paper first
by framing everything in that way (like omg you areee the future and you're gonna be amazing and like pls pls stayyyy) was just really offputting
oh this looks so interesting
if anything, it pushed me further out of the field
i kinda hate how they overglorify girls/women in the field
as someone who came out of the gwc immersion program
to be honest
it's of personal importance to me because he's in charge of the introductory cs courses here, and is my professor for cs 143x
and everyone else who bothers to care
<@!472541429130854421> I wanna hear your thoughts
reges says that most computing jobs will be male because men tend to have good math skills but poor communication skills, whereas women have both
it's similar to how most teachers are female because they're (allegedly) better at addressing emotions
not because of discrimination or oppression, but because That's Just How it Works Out
he basically says that the push for an even 50/50 men/women in computing is irrational and that the current 30/70 ratio we're seeing is as far as we're gonna get
an interesting article from Stuart Reges, one of the head lecturers at UW's CS

oh damn
<@!173668455856340994> i was scrolling through classes and found one that i thought you might be interested in
Granted I'm kinda ambivalent about it and not super negative
I feel like very few people would be into the idea of being deployed "anyplace, anytime, anywhere"
air force
can I interest you in some
hey kid
Lmao they saw you’re going to Canada for college and they’re like “NUUUUUU must recruit the potential defector”
This is so gung ho

Does this mean the lofi playlist is dead now?
Former??
update my fb bio in accordance with last night
Thank you, Alan. That's really nice of you to say. Really appreciate you, my dude
<@!258094439636008971> 1) you are one of the most supportive people I've ever met. period. it doesn't matter if a friend of yours is even just a little down, you'll come running full speed to cheer them up.
2) you never quit. I've seen your highs, your lows, and some in between, but you never *ever* stopped. even if it's to retrace your steps, ask for help from a friend, or to just sit and think for a while, you always get back up and try again. even I have trouble getting back up sometimes.
<@!472541429130854421> 1) you're smart, but not just in the  booksmart sense. you know where you're going and how, where you are and why, where you've been and how you got through it. as someone planning to go into the same industry, it's not easy, but I don't doubt for a second that you'll make it.
2) even though you're dealing with pressure from your parents in ways unimaginable to some, the weight of going to school out of state, and just managing to start living on your own takes guts. a lot of guts. it's those guts that it takes, to fight for yourself and your future that I look up to in you
Hi, just got back and just saw what y'all said, but thank you so much, Cindy. You're too kind. You're the actual best and so supportive.
like it's not like I felt depressed or anything just that I didn't wanna deal w people
it might have something to do w mental health not really sure but there've been occasions during the less-extroverted-stages where I've basically cut all human contact off for 3+ days at a time
<@!340319804747415553> 1) you work hard because you believe in yourself and the effect you can have on the world, something that I sometimes need to remind myself of
2) your sense of humor brings a lot to the table, keeping things fresh and calling people out when needed
I mean like several months at a time I'll tend to be more or less extroverted/shut-in-esque
and I don't just mean my flip-flopping between "super outgoing" and "hermit dead to the world"
I have phases of being more or less social
But essentially I crafted 80% of my friend group then ran out of social juices for the semester
I just know they’re super chummy with the military
fun fact apparently texas a&m has really close/influential ties to the US CIA
Then I gradually introduced random other people from the dorm, and the girl who is the daughter of my parents’ long lost Texas A&M friend
I met half of them randomly in the kitchen when there was no dining hall dinner one day
Honestly I didn’t get any friends from actual O-week events
True
My typical social interaction recharge time is 48-72 hours
o-week at UW wasn't a week it was like 3 days
Lately I’ve been rethinking that I might be an introvert
Made me sad :(
Oweek at uw was not friend making conducive
Because after I got a solid O-week friend group I was like I’m socially set for a while
it took me a While to make class friends
I don’t have class friends
class people are less degenerate
well ok I have 2 main friend groups, one is from o-week and one is from my classes
Lmao
strangely I feel like most of my friends are on a similar level of both competence and degeneracy
I’m on the more incompetent and degenerate side of my friend group
Shark tank mode: “Your numbers don’t add up. For that reason I’m out”
My impression of competence is being overshadowed by other people here
Quantum numbers?
Brain was like
I like dozed off
You shoulda seen me in chem today
Aw thanks
Lol
tbh the Competence thing applies to salina too tl;dr both of you have like 200x more brain cells than this hoe
and since we're doing this now <@!472541429130854421> you're one of the easiest people to talk to ever and I just get along really well w you despite being wildly different as people. you're like near-impossible to offend, genuinely kickass and just have an aura of Competence that I really admire
If at all
I’m prolly gonna do something super low effort
Also I forgot to bring sewing supplies ._.
I need to get to thrifting some pieces but I’ve been hella busy
I need one too
I need a costume
Ooooooh
I sat my ass down after like an hour and am figuring out halloween plans
solid
Just came back from marathoning stand up comedy videos
Hello guys
<@!258094439636008971> poofed a while ago but he participated earlier so I shall reciprocate. I mentioned this in dm a few nights ago but I have MASSIVE amounts of respect for how emotionally open you let yourself be (esp as a guy) and I wish I could open up/reach out to people in the same way. also you're just one of the most supportive people ever
Cindy:
1. You have a killer sense of adventure and I wish we did more stuff together but I guess things never really connected. I feel like that’s a huge reason why I think we’re not as super SUPER close as before - which is fine, we’ve both changed and grown as people.
2. I really admire your ability to just go for it. Even when I’m trying to figure out where to go next, I tend to be a lot more indecisive or just plain reckless. You have this sense of conviction that’s really refreshing to watch.
<@!340319804747415553> you're one of the people most genuinely invested in doing Good in the world I've ever met. also you're gorgeous, whip smart, insanely committed & hardworking, and have a very underrated sense of humor
Alan:
1. I really respect how committed you are to your hobbies. I sit down on my dorm floor and can’t tell what tea I’m making and I’m like lol this would kill Alan inside.
2. I appreciate how you balance being welcoming and being reserved. You seem like someone who’d be chill to chat with, even tho I don’t talk to you much
but I'm always down to shower praise on my fave ~~degenerates~~ perfectly respectable friends
Ah
I'm just in a hyper mood
If “ink”tober didn’t send the message clear enough lol
Im in a wholesome mood
we both broke that
If you can’t tell
or more
oh! 2 compliments per person
The give ppl words rules
wait what rules
True that
I'm sure noah would be thrilled for you to join in the action any day
Man I miss noah
LMAO
But you know what I mean
Fuck that’s bad wording
And how do I join in the action
What has happened to the rules
Fancy fancy
Wow
my egotism is through the roof tonight sorry folks
INTERNATIONAL lady friend who's also hot as fuck, thank you very much
Sorry I poofed
Anyhow
*lady friend*? :p
Riprip
my own room is a shithole
don't bother my dude
I gotta prep, special guest incoming
oh shit a week
take the feelings you have and share them with those close to you
spread the joy
I like did not realize how close that was
also it's kinda crazy to think I'll see you guys in a week
sending hugs from across the border
I know I asked for this but idk what to do w all the compliments now
okay that's it I promise
"strong" because you often stand up for yourself or your friends and defend what you believe in with all your heart
thank you
my cold dead heart just melted a lil
strong
oh god which one to choose
aaaaaaaaaannnndddds
open minded
goal-oriented
I was joking lmao this has already been plenty wholesome
self-caring
hun you're not obligated to do anything
adventurous
so it was
I'll give you three more then
fair point
ok but I gave like 5 other words too bc rules were made to be broken
which is already my nickname
*tea guy*
that's one step away from
*Tea Connoisseur*
they don't have to, uh, be a title like ***Lifetime Adventurist***
<@!340319804747415553> two words to describe me, then two words to describe cindy, go
a proper title
there
**Lifetime Adventurist**
I’m confuse
Hmm what’s happening
oof oops
TOO LAAAAATE
I'M KIDDING YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING
IT'S GONNA BE GOOD TRUST ME
NOW I GOTTA MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS
NO
take your time I'm just being a dick don't mind me
gimme a minute
`I can do better` can you now
uhhhhhhhhhh
how about
but I can do better than Explorer of LIfe
but aww my heart
avoidance and distraction babes, fake it till ya make it
if there's one thing I wanna learn from you it's to recognize when I need to take my mind off things and just disconnect from reality for a bit
but you also take time to rest and take care of yourself
you're one of the most outgoing and open-minded people I've met, and I really admire that about you
lmao fair enough
LOL
I didn't say I was good at calc 2
that's 3, maybe the dumbass hoe should apply to you instead mr. calc 2
Explorer of Life
2 words bout me go I'll start: dumbass hoe
(I'm beginning to see why "asshole" was on the list of common associations now)
Alan's Dorm
I guess you can come by tomorrow to meet your new best friend
You put in effort to make it inviting cuz you care about inviting people in
I get the message loud and clear
n o p e
No, that's not what I mean
thanks gene
got it
so you like my dorm more than you like me
You're comforting to be around and I mean, c'mon, have you seen your dorm?
but why "inviting" exactly?
I get chill, that makes sense with the tea and lofi stuff
okay hold on
Inviting and chill
⛰ 🚙
hiking buddy
you get them as well
you know what
that's a good one
I like that one
here's 2 more: hiking buddy
oh def not
THINK HARDER GENE
I'm trying to prove to my cousin's friends that my friends don't think I'm a shut in
Indescribably indescribable
<@!258094439636008971> okay but like for real
ass rule is now revoked
ass man?
okay now that you bring that up
Bitchass bitch
like ??? nice ass????
I was so baffled by the "ass" part for a sec
they cannot start with the words ass or tea
<@!258094439636008971> two words to describe me, go
3) why are you paying attention to me and not the lecture
2) mind your own fucking business
1) this is calc 1, I took calc 2 at skyline
like tf
I was texting my cousins about some stuff and he actually whispers to me "texting is bad  you know"
I don't know why it was hidden from me that he was such a mood
for cs is makes enough sense (10 years of programming), but in math I got annoyed with this dude sitting next to me
My brother was voted "most likely to be found not doing homework" his freshman year apparently
oh dude me too
sounds like a bomb sleepover
and a lot of the people in my classes think I'm really smart but I feel like I just pay attention
fun and sleepy
which is true, I hope
like I do think the other part of my rep is that I'm fun
It's still the early weeks here, so I'm trying to push myself to Go Out and Do Things with People
maybe "sleepy" was the wrong way of phrasing it lol more like "sleeps a lot"
I get that
I also use "I wanna take a nap" as an excuse sometimes when I wanna be antisocial
opposite of sleepy lol
I'd put you down as pretty outgoing
I subsist on naps
really?
p sure my reputation is "sleepy"
solid
"tea connoisseur" is currently my reputation on my floor actually
lol
sure
purposeful?
what's a good word for that
also, knows what he's doing w his life
chill & empathetic
uh
jk
"tea connoisseur"
@here
(I'm settling an argument in another server)
What're two words that you would use to describe me?
Watched several hours of video game play throughs, ate meal bars and drank sweet tea
I had no classes today so naturally I just NEETed the heck out the entire day
My problem is I always need to relax
Tea for relaxing
Coffee for doing things
Ok, well, that sounds about right. I'm glad to see you're taking care of yourself.
Can be bad if you're sensitive to it or are pregnant or have certain existing health conditions but generally muy bien
https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/coffee-good-or-bad#section9
well that's not super true
"minor"
Caffeine addiction doesn't do anything to you except for minor withdrawal symptoms if you stop
Caffeine addiction is decidedly not
Black coffee is good for you
Bad
Yes
Besides it's always taken a lot of caffeine to have an actual effect on me
It's exam week I'm allowed a pass
Take it easy there, Cindy. Damn
I'm like vibrating w energy and my headache is gone. God bless triple espresso shots
This may be the tea channel but I would like to say that coffee is superior
Idk either
???
comparable to alcohol for my body:
-alan's tea
-scratching my head
today we have learned
amazon is your friend
not within walking distance
With her hands holding on, and her arms connected to that, all while her legs carry her forward
If there is how would she carry it back to her dorm
Or target?
Or IKEA
No Walmart near by?
Like I have no way of transporting it
Is it weird if I order one online lmao
I need a table but idk how to actually procure one
Too fancy
Wow cushioned
There was a bookshelf that’s meant for the desktop but I turned it into a bedside table for extra desk space
I have way too much shelf space that I can’t reach and our rolling cushioned chairs are very very unsafe to stand on lmao
even with a tea table and side table in my dorm we're still struggling to find places to just put things down for a moment
there's a distinct lack of "putting down" space in dorms I feel
yeah it's a problem
Speaking of, I never used to pile things on my bed but now it’s right next to my desk which made it real convenient
The “pile system “
Hahaha
but it's complete chaos
you can get basically anything you throw on your bed instantly
it's like throwing things on your bed
but yeah HashSets are fun because they're the least organized kind of data structure
there's like 300 people in there too
my biggest lecuter is probably my cs one too
wow
It’s the biggest lecture at Duke with over 400 people in a hall
So far its mostly review with the exception of Hashsets
I’m in CS 201 which is data structures and algorithms
Every professor has different teaching speed, tests and grading curves
Usually math classes should logically be a large lecture hall taught by one professor but they split it into 30 person classes with like five professors
My math class is also kinda wack
I signed up for a compositional english class, and you probably know by know that that's the kind of english class I'm interested in
math is kinda wack but I'm staying on top of it for now
CSE 143X is fun because it's basic Java programming except at ridiculous speed
studying my dream school things
I'm at my dream school now
but hey
summer's gone and I kinda miss it because this last summer was one of my favorites
AGAIN
I woke up this morning shivering
I can
I can’t believe it’s October
so basically two weeks yeah
Two weeks
but class only started last Wednesday
it's day 12
You guys have been there for like a week now?
Thats really good
I'm still working on how extracurriculars and hobbies work into the mix, but by the end of this week I should have a better idea of how much time my after class work takes to properly schedule time to myself
getting 7 hours of sleep consistently, going to the gym four times a week, eating three meals a day, getting to class on time, balancing eating leftovers and going out, staying on top of homework and assignments
most of my daily routine I've figured out at this point
pretty solid so far
How’s life
Lol
eh, ten minutes and I still would've sent it
Whoops I thought you wrote ten minutes
I said ten seconds but "dirty liar" still seems warranted here
I'll give you a disturbance in your pants, <@478706068223164416> ;)
There were only eight minutes between the messages, you dirty liar
you think?
I really did
I thought about not sending that for a good ten seconds
there are no societal norms here
do it
the constraints of societal norms
sigh
I want to respond to that SO inappropriately wow
am i going to give alan 'a disturbance in his pants'
You’re going to be the next victim of the annual tea-pantsing
I don't want to know anything about you Alan
actually scratch that
I don't want to know about anything happening your pants Alan
ALAN
so that's why I felt a disturbance in my pants
This is pretty funny considering its just past one year anniversary of hoco last year
Chamomile specifically
Gah I just spilled tea on my pants
i.e. Medicare for all that gets rid of private insurance is opposed by 60+% of american adults
a lot of their core policies poll very badly across the board
I shouldn't say I think, that implies an opinion, this is fact
the other thing is that I think dems are making themselves less electable by going too progressive
I was really hoping for harris to pull through tbh but idk what she's doing anymore
I would support warren over trump but like. pretty reluctantly
Bruh if youre 1/625 chinese you cant really say that you're chinese
I'd be down to talk more after class though. It's always interesting to talk politics with y'all
Sorry, I got side-tracked cuz I took a wrong turn on campus
I dunno if I could vote for someone who would claim that they're native American while being at most 1/625 native
have fun
lol thanks for indulging my political rants
But I'll think on it
I need to get to class
Well I don't know
Hm
oh another beyond-2020 prediction lol Nikki Haley is almost guaranteed to be a republican president at some point
sure, but it could happen. my other major, beyond-2020 US politics prediction is that republicans will start winning while losing the popular vote a lot more often
and that most of warren's support comes from white college-educated liberals; she doesn't poll that well with minorities, and her support is concentrated in cities
It'd be such a Bad Look if trump lost the popular vote but won the electoral college twice
keep in mind that the electoral college heavily favors rural whites
yeah trump has a shitty record himself but it really doesn't matter because everyone knows that already and many accept him despite that. like I said earlier, it's about leveling the playing field
And the trump university shit
Mr. My son in law is a Harvard grad but doesn't know shit
Idk if he wants to bring up colleges
Trump doesn't have a great track record with universities either
I mean
for others, trump could smear her easily
for some, policy will be enough for her to earn their vote
the rumors that she "cheated" used racial claims to get into ivy leagues
she never addressed questions of personal integrity
has she?
nah it stuck for a while I think he could bring it back easily
And she already proved herself
Also media forgets about things pretty quickly. I doubt many people remember Pocahontas
I think sanders does too but to a slightly lesser degree
Idk about the other two
because he does
Yang made a big thing about appealing to trump voters
I'm pretty surprised that warren is steadily rising tbh
also, a lot of sanders/yang/biden supporters have come out and specifically said that they will vote trump if warren gets nominated
also, warren is quite unpopular within democratic elites
you'd be surprised
I think the odds are around 25% he'll get impeached in the next year
I also don't know how well trump appeals to moderates tbh
I don't think he'll get impeached
my predictions right now, having followed the dem primary, trump's approval ratings, previous elections, and the ukraine scandal very very closely:
-warren will win dem nomination
-trump will bring back "pocahontas" and question her integrity in a big way - this evens the playing field (warren may be popular among progressives now, but more moderate voters and independents aren't sold on her. damaging her image would be extremely easy)
-if he doesn't get impeached or very close to it, trump wins 2020 on a somewhat narrow margin
You have an interesting point tho
Granted, I don't live in a swing state
My main thing is idk how many true swing votes are actually out there at this point. Like, Trump's become such a divisive figure that it's kinda hard not to have an opinion on him already. This is pretty much Trump vs. not Trump at this point, and most people already know if they want one or the other (even more so than a standard election)
Idk like I think he'll win. I see reasons that he could lose but the only reason I have for him winning is "he's a white man. White men always have things work out for them"
a) his base is huge, b) the radical right is only a small portion of that base, c) that's not true, look at what happened in 2016 with clinton, the image of crooked hillary stuck even if you didn't believe specific allegations
He needs to appeal to more than the radical right to win
That only works on his base though. Everyone else only follows his Twitter to know what other crazy shit he comes up with
same with biden
warren has so many weaknesses for him to exploit
here's the thing about trump, he's amazing at using the media/forming a specific narrative
Sanders might be a bit hard-pressed to win, Biden feels like a coin toss, and I feel like Warren and Harris have an advantage of some sort
And Clinton was hardly a popular candidate for many people
Trump barely won against Clinton and he's only become less popular since then
I don't know about that
I don't think biden, warren or sanders have anywhere close to what it takes to beat trump in a straight election
Possibly
I mean
I kinda think the only way for dems to win now is to actually impeach trump
I can't imagine Trump ever like. Suffering consequences. Which will only fan conservative flames
I won't claim to know as much
Ok, fair enough
I'm just saying that's what I thought the current popular narrative on Biden was
no I know but looking at facts I think you're flat wrong
I feel like we need to see how the impeachment works out before making any predictions
I'm not saying that's my stance
gene, I disagree
At least, that's what I think most people seem to dislike
more that unfortunate circumstances (his name getting pulled into the whole ukraine scandal) and that he doesn't stand out at all
He's a bit too moderate
His policies aren't what a lot of people are looking for simply put
Huh. Figured it would go to him despite the problems he has
I wouldn't say he's gaffing himself out
P much
Really? Is Biden gaffing himself out of the election?
honestly I'm betting right now on trump winning 2020
it's looking increasingly likely that warren is gonna win the dem nomination and I'm increasingly apprehensive about that possibility
ok this is like unrelated to any of you but I crave people to talk to about american politics
Echidnas?
Ducks or snails?
<@340319804747415553> I'm disappointed in your memory
i really, really don't
i don't know, and i don't think anyone here wants to know
What
<@340319804747415553>
Barbed
God dammit, Jane
and spikey
Whaaaaaaaaat
My chem prof just said "it's long, hard, and pointy" and there was no reaction from anyone
Where's she from again?
Ripperoni lmao
This morning it was overcast outside so I asked my roommate “do you think it will be cooler today” and she said “well it’s probably 85...which is cooler than 95”
Its still 85-90 degrees every day
Fair
No, just kinda stuffy usually
That tired already?
On top of it
How else do you sleep
Last night was the first time I slept under my blanket at UW
Aint no incubus Gene
he has a gf
mmh
the walmart brand ain't half bad
i mean
Jiayi is the only one for me
I don't like the doubt that I'm feeling from you Jane
i'm sure not
If you say so
joking im sure
Wait was she serious?
that explains the chick swarm
so
lmao wow
i aint no succubus
man
i agree with her
whomstever she is
well
<@!173668455856340994> axel has a girlfriend?
solid
yessir you did
wait didn't I have a conversation with you about girls fetishizing gay guys
kinky
Axel's girlfriend has informed us that we should "do gay stuff together"
I'm still a little lightheaded ngl
lol cya
plot twist of the century
g'night
anyways
wait what
oh it's not the tea that's drugged, it's actually in the snacks that I give them with the tea
don't drug peoples' tea
night hun
don't let the bed bugs bite
sweet dreams
good night
okay
sleep
I think I should go to bed
it's starting to hurt to see
lol
yeah
then I tell them it's
"3 hours north"
"wooaaaaaaaah that's so cool!"
omg where
people will be like
it's fun because I can say I'm gonna go visit my friend at an international school
I haven't seen much korean food around here yet
we should get kbbq or something when I come to seattle
lol
😄
I'll go to van and we'll go dim sum hopping
maybe reverse
okay
true
tbh I'm spoiled now though van's chinese food is literally 300x better
we'll go to jade garden
yesssss
we'll swing by chinatown when you're here
it's decided then
light rail to chinatown takes like 10 mins
oh shit I should totally do that
day trip to Chinatown no longer takes an hour
true
light rail
but the bus system is easily the thing I've abused the most
(it's mostly food)
though the variety is lacking a bit
10 minutes over here gets me past dozens of restaurants and like 7 different boba places
yeah, I'm starting to see that now that I live in UW west campus
sammamish is like a purely residential area
most cities are like that though
in Sammamish, a ten minute walk got me to the end of my neighborhood
in Japan, a 10 minute walk could get you to two cafes, a bookstore, and a department store
that's sad
the only things within walking distance (for me) were Skyline and the town hall
ye there's nothing to do in the area
everything is at least 15 minutes away by car
I think that much moving around made me realize how tough it was to go anywhere from Sammamish
it was a lot of fun
lol yeah
BUT STILL
that shit was expensive
not price
freely in terms of accessibility
well
I kinda miss being able to explore that freely
we went to a lot of places
a few taxi miles and one trip around a lake on bikes
including shinkansen rails and local trains
combined with, I wanna say, several hundred miles worth of trains
nice
roughly twoish miles a day
so our total's around 60-70 miles on foot
I remember climbing a mountain or two there as well
we went to Fuji in September
but it also didn't include the entire Japan trip
threeish
= ?
57/19
19
31-12
hm math
but also we were in Japan starting on the 12th
true
which is less than 10000 steps a day
that's still less than 2 mi a day
that's pretty awesome but honestly not that much if you think about it
when I was in Japan, Google said we walked a total of 57 miles in the month of August
which is kinda sad actually
just no one uses it
I have a bike at home actually
lol
we'll just have to get a limebike and see
hmm
that's what they say, idk if I believe it
you do it once and never forget
it's like riding a bike
well
I haven't ridden a bike in so long that idk if I still know how
trains are good
but yeah
or maybe I'm just an unreasonable person who hates paying for transport
see: both days I was in SF, I walked ~9-10 miles
so walking a ton is basically only an option when I'm alone
my friends are weak
trains > cars > biking > walking > busses > taxis
so under ideal conditions for all forms
anything more depends on how much it would cost
anything less is doable
I draw the line at about 20 minute walk
walking also depends a lot
I would def put it above taxis
and trains are my favorite because they're the only form of transport that I can't get motion sickness from
I really like walking tbh
biking can move above busses and even cars if there's enough traffic though
still though, trains > cars > busses > taxis > biking/walking
I've taken more public transport in these last two months than I have in my entire life
I haven't driven regularly in almost two months now and it feels weird
I'm so excited to drive again
lol I wouldn't mind doing an evening session
dear god I am turning this place into a tea house
wait am I scheduling a tea appointment right now
I'll leave the choice up to you
I personally recommend an evening one, but it can be hard if you don't have lodging here
it's just a matter of whether or not you want a day session or an evening session
gotta keep w the aesthetic
nice lol
maybe throw in one or two more fake plants
hopefully I'll be able to keep this place together for long enough
alright nice, I'll be sure to keep that open
so yeah mostly 12-13
11-14
oct 12-13 is what I had down
oct 13th, right?
your visit
back to greener pastures
a n y w a y s
do update me on the situation if you ever hear more though
it sounds like they're getting the care they need, so it sounds like it's going in the right direction
yeah....
lol I hope your friend's friend will turn out fine
I was just reflecting
you're fine
lmao
your visit
SO
uhhhhhhhhhhhh
uhhhhhhhhhhh
you right
shit
lowkey is it kinda fucked up that I'm having this conversation 5 mins after a friend told me one of his friends just got hospitalized for alcohol poisoning
and I was blissfully listing off all the signs of drunkenness that Gene was exhibiting as I poured him another steaming cup of sleep juice
as part of my job at the plat club
I mentioned that I had undergone alcoholic beverage server training before
I was bestowed the title "Bar*tea*nder"
wow rip
the image of Gene drunkenly/sleepily stumbling down the hallway towards the lounge with his Switch bag in hand stays with me
by the time we got to the Jasmine, Gene was on the floor and Jane was half asleep
by the time we got to Java Oolong, Gene and Jane were already slouching on the beds and chairs
I poured everyone a cup of Sencha, and things were underway
over the course of about two hours
I served up Sencha, Java Oolong, and Jasmine/Chrysanthemum
we had a tea party tonight
....explain
gene and jane can get drunk off tea
today's lesson
But more likely they’d just cut out the whole toenail and let it regrow
If I got a doctor to do it it would count as surgery
No idea
when does something count as surgery?
ah
I had ingrown toenails a lot
surgery?
I used to do surgery in my toenails every other week so I’m desensitized to blood and pain
they're fun
I like knives as a tool
my own blood doesn't bother me at all
too much time in the hospital seeing my own
also blood doesn't really bother me that much
I've even made them before
I like knives
edge of a scalpel
so that was like usually not super appealing
other peoples' blood grosses me out a bit
edge of a knife
knives have an ultra small serrated edge so they cut from the sliding
knifes don't cut well from pushing, they're not scalpels
don't push the knife into their throat, side it across
probably not lmao
no idea if that much would actually dissolve
walk up behind someone, wrap your left arm around their chest and pull them towards you, use your right hand to slit their throat as their pulled backwards
I'm gonna avoid all the previously-suicidal stuff, the one I remember most clearly outside of that was like crushing a bottle or two's worth of pills into water on a bedside table
wow that's really specific
which is also one of my fears about being killed
like for me it's always been slitting someone's throat from behind
I meant more specific than that
sleeping pills always seemed like the most painless way
mostly knives and drugs
ah
I was talking more about specific ways
like no specifics
I don't remember anything from that though
I'm sure I've thought about killing other people in passing
really?
and no that is not predictable
ah, fun
quite predictably, I have only actually fantasized about killing my parents and killing myself
no shit murderous ones
no sexual ones
what, about murderous fantasies?
anyone want to share specifics?
this is why I bring this up
https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/segments/180103-whos-bad
anyways
rather ruins the fantasy doesn't it
Do you own a gun?
ah, well that could be a problem
No
no lol
do you own a sword?
same and I would add poison
Sword when I read more fantasy novels
Knife, gun
any specific methods you've thought about?
It was more a contemplative “what would it be like to be a murderer” rather than having a specific target in mind
you're more hurting the people around them at that point than the person themselves
Yeah I thought more about the act than the result
you don't care
well when you're dead you're dead
more like inflicting pain or what
so I gotta think about it
hmm, the dyeing part was never really a focus
Generally the definition of killing includes the opposite party’s death
yep
like as in they die
yeah
specifically killing?
yeah it is
that's a very broad question
I don't think any of you will turn out to be actual murderers, but I mean you could surprise me
Me
Me
like just in passing or as a fantasy
ok don't freak out about me asking the question, it has to do w my sociology class, but out of curiosity, who here has thought about killing someone
So I'm pretty much attempting to win the 15 dicks challenge this weekend ;)
G'night
I might read a bit first, but yeah
night
you should too
anyway i should probably try to go to sleep
he's a bard but in real life
Or use shitty pick-up lines on dragons
great
Stereotyped for being fuckboys that try to flirt with everything
Bard's a D&D class
a what?
Quintessential fuckboy class
but like he just doesn't seem nice
Get him to play a bard
too busy doing fuckboy things
Jonathan probably could, idk about Sean since he's p busy
Ok Cindy I'll readily admit that Sean's p hot
D&D required a lot of time set aside for a session
Oh true
Fuck, I need to get super into D&D so I can DM a campaign for them sometime
if you can get Sean to play games with us then maybe i'd reconsider
but then I've never Had romantic Feelings to manipulate
ngl I'm often kinda into that attitude
Well, fuckboy vibes can be erased with a healthy serving of D&D
Jonathan gives me less strong fuckboy vibes
alright well Sean gives me strong fuckboy vibes
not SUPER into it but curious and interested
^
it's probably a sign of mild interest?
"Fuckboy vibes/habits" is humorous
Fuckboy's only offensive if it's a reputation
Also, Jonathan started try to flip through my D&D player's handbook with some mild interest and then shut the book five minute into me walking it through with him (not out of rudeness or being done but just being tired). Idk if that's a sign of interest or not
like i don't mean it to be super offensive
Oh really? I use fuckboy similar to how I'd use bitch, I guess
Linguistics time
why is this so interesting
I find "fuckboy" more offensive than "bitch," but part of that may be that I'm a guy. The difference is that it doesn't cross the line from offensive to derogatory.
like that i'm "easy" or like a sex toy
i dunno it's just the connotation i guess
yea i guess that's true
True
all it does is imply promiscuity, which is not necessarily a bad thing
slut is also pretty basic as far as insults go
i'd be mildly offended if it was some rando i never met who called me a bitch
i mean yea
I'd be mildly offended by being called a fuckboy, but it's far from the worst thing I could be called
I think that's more of a personal thing though, I don't mind getting called a slut at all unless it's my mom screaming it at me when she knows nothing about my life
But like I don't care much about being called a bitch, I'd care if someone called me a slut
I could see that starting to happen
yeah
Not to the same scale as bitch
Hm
I wouldn't think of it as a hardcore insult either!! man I don't know how to communicate this. like I feel like the term "slut" has been reclaimed for the most part
like if someone called me a slut i'd be a upset
I feel like "slut" could be used as a deeply cutting insult
really? Fuckboys are annoying but I wouldn't use it as a hardcore insult
idk
but what I'm saying is I think being a slut is seen more neutrally than being a fuckboy in most places in 2019
fuckboys are just like "oh annoying, he's a fuckboy" whereas for women it's like "oh she's a slut"
because men are praised for sex while women are shamed for it
so like the female version is just super simplistic and far more judgemental
idk how to explain it either, like I can call someone a bit of a fuckboy and still like/be friends with them, but I think media portrays The Fuckboy as someone who uses others (usually girls) for sex, and it's just a different vibe from being slutty or thotty
calls are also known as "booty calls" and can occur with the help of devices fashioned to better convey messages to a willing mate
the wild fuckboy can be identified by mating calls made late at night, identifiable by their low tone to better travel over distances to reach potential mates
I don't know how to explain how I think of fuckboys
Like douchey guys who usually hang out in groups or with girls that like them and then they move on fairly quickly
but like, in a douchey way
it's not That negative but I would rate it as significantly more negative than calling someone a slut bc like jane said slut implies sex while fuckboy (I think) often implies emotional manipulation for sex
I don't think I'm wording this properly
But maybe that's just because society is harsher on women who sleep around than men
No I don't think it is
Uh how old is this monitor?
I know fuckboy isn't a compliment, but I didn't realize it was that bad
And I think he has one, but I don't think the minister has an HDMI in
slut has a weird history, but I feel like it's mostly fine these days for girls to be slutty and proud, while "owning" being a fuckboy is strange and has a weird connotation
Is fuckboy that negative?
Do you have an hdmi port on your laptop?
Slut only implies sexual activity
Fuckboy has a lot of other things attached to it
Bitch
Plug it in, make sure it's raw, condoms will interfere with the connection
My roommate found one someone was gonna throw away
Why does slut not work?
I feel like it's lost quite a bit of it's bite
<@193229269076279298> how do you hook up a monitor to a laptop? HDMI?
also I feel like "fuckboy" is viewed more negatively these days
I feel like white girl is used the same way but i feel bad about that
you can be a male thot
Thot knot
although i feel like basic is also common
not the same connotation
Thot
hm
woo girl
y
btw, is there a proper female equivalent to being a fuckbo
i didn't say he WASN"T one
i said he was less fuckboy-ish
no
According to you, he's a confirmed not-a-fuckboy
Jane is the best stretch guru
true, but very few people can
HE WILL NEVER MATCH UP TO ME
Excuse you
JONATHAN IS LOW TIER
it just happens, schools are competitive
jonathan can take my place
I DON'T NEED YOU, I HAVE JONATHAN
or you can have your own roommate stretch session
aw gene I can do them with you
yeah i felt like that was just kinda shitty
Sorry, Noah. We still love you.
Also, at a dance party for dawg daze, the mosh pit started chanting "FUCK WSU" to the music lmao (I wasn't there, but my roommate showed me a clip)
Update: I felt bad for being so unathletic and started stretching too. Jonathan then pointed out I was doing it wrong and started showing me how to do it properly
i would be concerned if they thought about that a lot
but like we should tell them by the end of the week
also i doubt this is a forefront concern in their heads
we did them yesterday too
it's quite nice
Also, my roommates are still convinced me and Jane are twins
Lmao I admire your guys' group stretching sessions
kk
Just a random dude on our floor
brb we're gonna do some stretches
he's on our floor
who's joshua
Ok, Toshua !== Joshua in that joke
she's going to convocation
Convocation
Nope can’t
Sleep in tomorrow if you can
wait ask Jonathan to get a photo of Toshua
Aww, Salina
aw im sorry
yikes
Woo
I slept like actual shit
Jonathan just came back lol
how've things been so far
nice nice
Yea
did you also move in yesterday?
hey love
I’d guess 5’7”-5’9”
Def shorter than me
he's like a bit shorter than Gene I think?
yeah so like it's not difficult
ah ok
5 ft 4
wait jane how tall are you
Also, Jonathan's getting a lot of texts and his phone is just sitting here
Sean's taller than me, that's all i could say
damn ok guys
We really are twins
Jonathan looks like the same for one of my family friends
My family friend was like hella tall
how tall is he
I JUST REALIZED
He looks like a shorter, thinner version of one of my old family friends
loool
And I do have enough condoms for ten fucks
Although beggars can't be choosers
you sure?
Not my type lol
😉
in which case, Gene go wild
ok yeah my bad he might be gay
ok studious fuckboy
or guys'
~~because he's trying to get into girls' pants~~
Also, he locked himself away for an hour to study math before classes had started
hmmmm
He said it was a last-minute idea on his way here
and then refused to give any to people you already knew
he went around with cupcakes to introduce himself to people
It's been 2 days lol
I've def pulled that kinda stuff
well maybe it was a legit thing
it's rude therefore fuckboy
then LEFT because "my friend asked me to pick something up for her"
Is that a fuckboy trait?
gene lmao
I was explaining the game to him and he was on his phone TEXTING
~~Fuckboy whomst I will gladly fuck~~
He's a p chill fuckboy I guess lol
If one of them is a fuckboy, well
They're both cool guys
I'm mainly just kidding
I know lmao
I mean some people look like fuckboys but really aren't
i'm judgemental and i'm telling you it's Sean
oh gotcha
hm
<@520095106888630348> it's by room, not floor
But I'm getting fuckboy-ey vibes from both, and I'm not sure if I'm being judgemental or not
last night a bunch of international students were drinking vodka in the lounge
but they opted into it yeah?
Yeah, but idk how respected that policy is
I kinda feel like that dramatically decreases the Fuckboy^tm chances
aren't you in a substance-free room though
i'm telling you it's SEAN
Also, I'm 90% sure at least one of my roommates is a fuckboy, and I'm having trouble deciding which one
Internally
surprisingly, a lot of people didn't react
Who wouldn't laugh lol
and it makes sense but it made me laugh when people were like advertising it to us
also I put this on my insta a while ago but my school's wellness center sells sex toys
Real water balloon hours
they're free here too, and sold across campus
Wait, I know you told me this, but the fact that the meal plan counts is amazing
this was a store covered by my meal plan lmao
Ripperoni lmao
UW has a grocery store were you can buy condoms with your meal plan
I was picking up cold meds earlier today and almost smacked myself in the face with magnum condoms when I stood up
Gotta find out what you like most
an icon
First thing someone asked was "what do you do with them? Trade them like Pokemon cards?"
Honestly
LMAO
Just started taking them cuz free shit
helen was telling me about a guy at duke who was collecting em by brand
Free condoms at her community college
why is there always someone with a condom collection
She's also p hot
she seems like the type tbh
So maybe I should just give them to them
Someone on our floor apparently has a condom collection
Lmao
you won't make it to 15 on that
I guess 10 isn't actually very many
Higher than I'd like
he has a high opinion of you
salina wasn't there
Lmao
I'm scared
It was completely unironic
omg I love that
I feel attacked
LOL
After hugging me, first thing he did was hand me a pouch and whisper "there's 10 condoms in here" into my ear
aw rip
I met with my Dad for dinner since he was upset he couldn't be there for my move-in day
I told Jane and maybe Salina this already
Also
gotcha
^
oh ok fair
really don't think he wants me having sex in his room
your roommates aren't bad looking
wait why not the roommates?
In joking as much as you are
I know lol
I wouldn't actually
ahahahaha
Ok, maybe the next door neighbors too
tea
Honestly, I should send pictures of my roommates later so that you know which ones are off limits. Everyone else is fair game.
I shall restrain myself though
oh man I could make so many jokes with "playing smash"
Jane, you're not helping
.....he might still be playing smash?
Uh
send pics
Toshua's a hottie
bitch you sent me into a coughing fit bc I started cracking up
Yeah, especially Toshua
LMAO
if you hooked up with someone on our floor you wouldn't have to worry about sleeping in our dorm when you visit
there are some p attractive people on the floor
tbh
I mean, that's a completely valid mentality
lmao ok cindy
~~actually that's like my mentality towards any sexual encounters ever~~
Cindy, I'm kidding lol
Too inefficient for the fifteen dick challenge
tbh I'd be way more willing to have an orgy or gangbang w people I *don't* know very well
don't be weak
Please no
oh are we having an orgy with the floor?
Yeah, like Jane and Noah said, I'd like to get to know people better before I get involved in gang bangs with them
...true
Orgies are inefficient, gang bangs are where it's at
how many orgies have you participated in noah
I mean, no, but I'd be surprised if the number was high enough that you'd lost track already
👀
Wait were we supposed to stop after 15?
how many dicks in are you in the 15 dicks challenge?
ah
Also can be said about sex
but anyway yeah it was a good way to meet people
this edition of things i said that could be about sex
damn nice!!
yeah i enjoy it more with people i actually know
It wasn't even quiet hours, and we got a warning from one of the RAs lol
We just had an open invitation to our floor to play Jackbox with us, and we had like thrice as many people as we expected show up
like I'm surprised by how many hardcore followers it has
some people really buy into it
anyways, I brought this up bc I was watching videos of people making fun of zodiac signs. I was just like, huh
I gave up on originality and just focused on enjoying the things I liked, and I think it's worked out for the better
lmao
I try to be original, but then I remember I'm an Asian teenager who likes reading manga with tea, KBBQ and Dim Sum, listens to K-Pop and J-Pop, and drives a Honda
sometimes viewed as the weirdos of the western zodiac
likes to be original lol
progressive, independent, likes to be original, bit sensitive
so moral police
ah
bit like the infj stereotype
what's that?
so aquarius then?
I do think you're hardworking and responsible I just also don't think that's the main Aura you exude lmao
disciplined? not since senior year
I've been called responsible by friends' parents
I'd say I work hard at the things I like (but then again, who doesn't)
I can be a hardass when I'm put under pressure
hardworking, responsible, very disciplined. sometimes a bit of a hardass
what's a capricorn supposed to be like?
I never really paid attention to zodiac signs that weren't chinese
it's cool
lol
man my basic side is coming out full force
I guessed aquarius
but yeah like I wouldn't have pegged you as a capricorn
12 02 2001
mine's just a bunch of the same 3 numbers
that's kinda lit
damn
fun fact
if you write it as 01/10/01 (011001) it's 25 in binary
Jan 10 2001
01 10 2001
<@!478706068223164416> I forgot when's your bday
me me me me me
“They love to possess the best of everything but have no patience for shopping” lmao so basically an ideal consumer
i.e. my dad is technically a cancer
but like I do know a lot of cases where it doesn't work
salina probably remembers this idk if she's here rn but we had a Major Astrology Phase in like soph year when alex and I hunted down a lot of astrology memes
Yes I do prefer to work alone
on the western side the sagittarius stereotype fits creepily well
^response to helen not alan
a leo stereotype though lol
ok that's like
supposed weaknesses: eccentric (probably), tactless (I hope not), fiery (yeah okay during Smash), intolerant (sometimes, I try not to be), unrealistic (sometimes)
Honestly out of the snake ones fire snake would probably be more accurate for me lol
everything else is decently accurate though
also also wouldn't consider myself easily stressed
decisive sure, inspiring I couldn't tell you, magnanimous potentially, sensitive a little, ambitious less so, romantic we've yet to see
I also wouldn't call myself non-talkative
I wouldn't call myself "wise"
<@!472541429130854421>
decisive, inspiring, magnanimous, sensitive, ambitious, romantic
supposed strengths
never really looked into it, hold on
Idk if mine are still accurate and I don’t know much about either anyway
but I'm very aware that this is frequently not the case, and also if I read all the descriptions a bunch of the other ones could also work for me
tbh both my chinese and western zodiac are pretty accurate for me
I still find that dumb
2001 is the actual start of the century
According to my mom every Asian person wanted kids in 2000 and that’s why there’s so many kids born that year lol
2001 is gold snake year too
nah I just searched it up it's a thing
but that's probably completely made up
I got super lucky because according to my mom dragons born on the year 2000 are considered golden dragons
I’d like to see my fortune read at some point too
But hard to understand
Astrology is interesting
wait that's so cool
Hello
yeah lol
ohhhhhhh
before chinese new year
2001
wait you were born in 2000???
dragon
alan what's your zodiac
so we're batting positive, at least in Japan
lol
I had good luck, uncertain luck, then good luck again
when I was in Japan I took all the fortunes and stuff I could
iss esspensive though so this ain't happenin till this summer/late this school year at the earliest
I'm not a believer but I'm so curious what they'd say
tea I kinda really wanna get a reading from a professional astrologer or fortune teller or smth at some point in the next few years
idk how much longer HK is gonna be able to keep this up
which is good
as of rn china looks very reluctant to use military force
I wanna be able to go back to Hong Kong and use Google
I'm more concerned about China invading Hong Kong than Taiwan right now
Looks like Taiwan's best bet is to just ensure that invading them would be as painful as possible as a deterrent
True
I think it gets less popular rave attention if that makes any sense
But my gut reaction was surprise
And no one wants to actually go to war w China
Anyways like it makes sense, could be perceived as an internal conflict etc
Haha haha
Also, I was searching for analysis on what would happen if China invaded Taiwan and I hate that nuking a hurricane came up
Really? I’m not surprised
I was surprised that China invading Taiwan is the lowest
Interesting how all the lines climbed over time
This is super super interesting
That is fair
<@258094439636008971> I blame you
<@!193229269076279298> I blame you
Yeah lmao
It was p funny
She wouldn’t acknowledge either of us
Lol same
Yeah, it was just sheer shock for me
I forgot about that but she told me
yikes
Also, apparently Makenna goes to UW. I randomly ran into her.
"I don't know what the idea UBC student is like, but based off my observations it must be whatever I'm not"
and I'm not allowed to say there isn't an ideal
idk how to even begin qualifying that
like we were supposed to go to events, do observations with our newly-learned Sociological Skills! wow! and then write about what the "ideal ubc student" looks like
it's very strange
first paper is due monday for sociology
I have literally 0 motivation rn though
I should probably actually work on stuff since I'm trapped in waking consciousness for now
lmao
Basically pirate me
Closest other is Arrighi
p sure you're the only noah righi on venmo too
oh lol
Only Noah Righi on Instagram
Wdym one of one?
Now I'm straight up dying though like couldn't sleep yesterday without popping a bunch of advil, making some pep tea and eating like 3 cough drops right before I tried
First 2 days were fine slight sore throat, headaches, but manageable
Like 5
Also how many days have you been sick for?
Jeremy's QFC post was just so wholesome to me for some reason
I feel special
I'm one of one on Instagram
How's life on your end
Anyways I'm sick miserable and can't sleep
True
They could just be mass adding people
Yeah esp since I'm Cindy Wang #1000000
Possibly just coincidence
Ok that's suprising then
Nope
Did you tell them your name?
It wasn't weird that they were reaching out it was weird that they found my insta like a day later when I didn't give them any info
They may just have special accounts to "connect with potential recruits"
Idk if that's weird then
Idk if I would advertise that shit all over my personal lol
But like with recruity accounts??
Recruiters
Like the recruiters personally or the navy insta?
That's like a lot of life to give up though
I was and maybe still am considering doing the 2 year navy program
It was still creepy when recruiters tried to follow me on insta though
Granted I was actually semi interested and had like been browsing their websites
Navy for me
Recruit
Or recruit you?
Like to help you?
They’re persistent
It be weird
I’ve been approached by coast guard
yeah, but you still need people on the ground, and I just read about how one guy got captured and killed himself before he could get interrogated so
at least not anymore
not the age of warm bodies
we're in the age of technology
very rarely
I'm not sure how high of a chance of dying I'd be chill with, and I have no idea how often people die
I've read accounts
yeah
they approach people?
would be super cool though. idk
I don't know if I'd apply unless someone approached me about it
correction "when you're trying to get into the CIA"
lol go for it
of course
what, if I end up in the cia?
Imma say so much shit about you
but I'm gunning for the state dept
I wouldn't be opposed
anyways
no I just searched it up you don't need it for field work either
lots of desk work you can do
I don't think you need 20/20 vision
preferable both
or make things that go fast
I wanna go fast
I don’t have the 20/20 vision
too boring
na
out of curiosity
would y'all ever work for the cia
sure, but the historical stuff is super fascinating too
how do you withstand 1700 C
like, what the fuck are they doing to those turbine blades
aerospace is horrible for this
so they don't want to give away their starting point
because chances are we're using some much more sophisticated version of it now
especially anything technology based
all the interesting stuff is still classified
this is something that disappoints me about classified stuff
if y'all are ever bored search up jonna and tory mendez. absolute badasses. I was so shook
anyways I went down a rabbit hole reading and watching former CIA operatives
it's quality
and my reply to that would be quantity isn't hard
I know
also I thought "swallows" was your answer to my question "and what were the grading criteria?"
idk if the double entendre also works in russian
swallows
no I was elaborating on salina's point lmao
lol
girls were called swallows, guys were less common but called ravens
na
so many more details need to be known
swallows
and what were the grading criteria?
yeah i didn't realize that was based on history
It was codenamed with some other bird
It’s what red sparrow was based on
also who was doing the teaching?
lmao
I wanna know the class names
like other countries just train people once they're in an intelligence agency
with graduates
sure, but they had a full-out school
^
basically all the countries had some spies use seduction in one way or another
wait you didn't know that?
TIL cold war russia actually had a school where they trained female spies to seduce targets
I'm more than enough noise for myself
hello silence my old friend
indeed
only silence
no talk
though I'm the same when it comes to math or physics. still don't talk out loud
And why the fuck don't these forces sum to zero
oh gosh
dID YoU KNoW i'M aN ArTs STuDeNT?
true
Mostly for engineering, as in wait that moment is the other way
My isn't about "that doesn't sound right" as in English, mine is that doesn't sound right mathematically
We also generally do very different work
if I'm trying to work through a problem I will usually list things out on paper, or sometimes I'll type it out
I would say my thoughts are usually more coherent than my speech, though neither are as coherent as my writing. usually.
but I usually don't do that myself tbh, I go through at the end and mentally read it aloud?? idk if that makes sense but there's a difference to me between just reading and reading it out loud in my head
like when I edit peoples' papers n shit my #1 advice is to read it out loud to catch grammar errors and/or repeated words
I'm also really good at sounding things out in my head
it's just habit
I never talk to myself
So I get two chances to say "wait that doesn't sound right"
Because when you say stuff you check it one to verbalize it and once when you hear it
Walking to myself helps me work through complex problems easier
even if I'm too lazy to type with punctuation a ton of the time
the comma is important
you answered "why, do you talk to yourself?"
ok that's not what I meant, but I'm also not surprised there
Also Nicholas and Gabe
My roommate comments on it
A lot
yes
why do you talk to yourself?
Jk
Why do I even talk to inferior creatures
No shit sherlock we both were
*Really*
I've never used it to like buy alcohol from a store
was joking both times, god, keep up
yeah you asked and I answered
-_-
Can I not just make conversation
anyways, with what evidence
i TRUSTED you
SMH
Also `also, so what if I have` report you to the authorities
Fixed
why am I not surprised
lmao
Sean went over the border to, drink, gamble, and go to a strip club for his 19th birthday
i don't personally know anyone who's done this but I know for a fact that tons of 19-year-old americans come north of the border to drink
maybe further north or in rural areas they wouldn't be
anyways I guarantee you van is plenty familiar with US IDs
to use in canada, I mean
but it's more believable and easier if I just get another US ID
probably
Wouldn't you always want to show them the license they're less likely to be familiar with
also, so what if I have
so like they'd have to accept the canadian one
no I mean if it's a canadian person they're not gonna have a US ID
Also have you ever actually used the US fake?
I mean I assume someone in Florida knows what a US ID looks like
but like it's not like they're gonna have a US ID
basically, I assume
Is it just "that looks official enough"
Like they have no clue what one looks like I assume
How does a person in Florida supposed to check a Canadian license?
it'd just say I'm 19 and not 21
even if I wanted a fake to use specifically in canada ~~which I'm probably gonna get sometime next month~~ I would get a fake US drivers license
US fake and yes
Actually will they even accept each others drivers driver's licenses as a way to verify age?
A us fake or a Canadian fake?
not gonna help me on this one though
I have a fake
I mean
It would let you vote
Have you considered not being underage
I will be voting in 2020 which is v exciting
canadian election is in about a month
Are we voting on anything this year?
also I'm upset that I can't vote
which would be really fucking weird lmao
there's also the possibility of a coalition government
maybe Trump has lowered my standards, but at least Trudeau's international reputation is pretty solid. he's done a lot for Canada. everyone focuses on the negatives
Which is problematic in itself
Yeah he’s lagging in polls
bc Scheer as PM is terrifying
I still hope he pulls through
but that tends to have to do with not following through on policy
Trudeau's more problematic than he appears for a number of reasons
I feel like it's dumb that people are literally calling for him to resign
idk
when the cultural context and standard of what was considered offensive was super different
and this is from ~20 years ago
he apologized basically immediately
but
not that blackface isn't bad
And stuff when he was teaching at West Point
highkey, I'm pissed that this is Such A Big Deal
Yup
I figure none of you are plugged into canadian politics and idk how prevalent this has been in world news, but this week there's been a scandal about leaked pics of trudeau in blackface
Sip sip
tea time
Lol wow
lmao
gotta ask him how it went the next Monday
prof: "if you saw my wife, believe me, you would understand the temptation" (this is kinda wholesome honestly. he talks about her a lot)
class: *crickets for like a solid 30s* then we all cracked up
That One Kid Who Didn't Get the Implications of "wanting to be with her": "just bring her with you!!" 😄
*nice*
good for him
idk how to react to this lmao
my poli prof was basically just like "I fully support y'all and my class will be canceled, but I'm probably not going so I can have sex w my wife"
so ubc's climate strike is next fri

ah fun
tomorrow's my last full day home
just the endless void of existentialism to contemplate
i have nothing tomorrow
eh
also, get some rest
thanks for the insight
fair enough
there are people who did really well in hl2 (tests are 75-80??? of grade) because they were just very careful on tests
it'll be fine
i'm just stating that this is mildly yike
it's a tough number to think about but also *it is possible to succeed*
i'm not too wound up over it
i mean, it's a series, isn't it?
i would say don't get too wound up over it now
or even the 9 months that high school finals requires from you
you won't be expected to remember things for insane amounts of time
like quarters are 10 weeks long i think
which is not quite the two years IB required from you
dont sweat it
you're gonna be fine
fair enough
i kinda expected this, but it hurts to see that number
in one of my classes my grade was made up of my midterm, my final, and an essay
thats just how college be most of the time i think
gg
i'm finding out now that tests are 95% of my math grade
Figured I'd share bc we've had this discussion so many times
This was v interesting and not what I expected

well that's freaky
-we've been talking about failed states and also 1984 in poli
-dyeing my hair came up in conversation
-I geeked out over marvel again with lena on the bus yesterday
-some of my friends are taking greek myth this term so percy jackson jokes happened (there was a weird side plot involving this that I didn't mention bc I don't really remember how it worked)
-news about the drone attack
-was explaining where I grew up to some friends last night over sushi, so I was thinking about home
-was also talking about the frequency of bomb/shooting threats in the US, and mentioned that lockdown earlier this year, so guns were also on my mind
I don't think it actually says much about my state of mind, I can trace almost every aspect of the dream I can remember back to something I have thought about in the past 3 days
it was really fuckin weird
long story short
yeah idk
eventually someone sees me and tries to shoot me through a window but somehow I teleported out?
and then there was this whole sequence where I was basically immediately found out/marked as a threat bc I was wearing normal clothes and everyone else was like grimy and ragged, and I got chased around a building before locking myself in a room listening to one of the maniacs chasing me like crooning "come out and play" horror-movie style
the thing I remember most clearly is getting dropped off at the top of the hill on 228th and walking down past like. run-down, abandoned, graffitied versions of like the chipotle/met market area
the marvel part was that I think I was like a shield spy or smth cause I was taking orders from nick fury and nat romanoff. also I had pink hair (Ifeel like the dream as a whole was a massive hodgepodge of everything I've been thinking about lately). and we were like supposed to infiltrate a building, which turns out was in sammamish, where I'm from irl, so they sent me. so now I have a really vivid image of like post-apocalyptic sammamish in my head lmao
one thing I remember is that last night i read about the drone bombing on saudi oil fields and for some reason my brain freaked out, took that and turned the US into a full-out dystopia
damn I forgot parts of it anyways
granted, my brain was still like hyperactive when I went to sleep
Bonus points if you teach them to ice skate
But I kinda wanna see someone get two shibas and call them the shib sibs
This is a dumb thought
Well, more so Noah cuz he was talking in the other channel
Accidentally woke up. What the hell are you guys doing awake?
What's up with tonight and weird dream?
Anyways I'm gonna go back to sleep but I'm dropping this here as a reminder so hopefully I won't forget
What the fuck subconscious why was that so dark
I just woke up from the wildest and most terrifying Marvel/Percy Jackson/crazy dystopia/real life crossover dream
i have just realized that meters are a pain to work with in regards to thirds
please note that this is not a metric is better than feet sorta thing
I do
ah you probably have some choice words Noah
you can however divide feet into thirds quite easily
you cant divide meters into thirds very easily
Damn that's crazy
now we're almost halfway through september
so that was my friday the 13th experience
or (*gasp*) eat real food
i guess i can always go to the one in issaquah
i'm a little upset i never got a mcflurry or any mcnuggets or even a mcchicken
yeah, no ambulances
and i doubt anyone was using any drugs you'd be surprised to catch a bunch of high schoolers with
if you didn't hear any ambulances they were probably fine
i heard the light/lamp hit some people on the head, but they apparently booked it, so i take it that they're ok
i hope no one got seriously hurt
yeah, me too
im glad everything was mostly ok
weird ok
huh
it was early enough that could theoretically still be comfortable taking your 6 year old to get a happy meal in sammamish
we're usually in and out before sus boi hours
certainly before 10:30
around 10PM?
what time was this?
i'm just glad they're safe
honestly, half the band group didn't even see it happen cuz they got there after the fact. this had clearly been brewing half an hour before we even left skyline
yeah, we did our best
alright well be careful
there was a fucking rave going on for some reason tonight
cuz if you bring 10-15 band kids into a mcdonald's at night, you're gonna outnumber anyone who might be a vague threat to you and be safe in that regard
i mean, we've been doing for years and it's been fine
yeah
maybe avoid late night mcdonalds
as long as you all are ok
we ended up walking across the street to mod to avoid looking suspicious
they had just gotten out of their cars and were slowly making their way to the door in confusion when everyone started running out
apparently mcdonald's is where people go for drug deals
we just wanted a late-night snack
they weren't there, were they?
this was a fucking mcdonald's
yeah, i immediately parked and phoned my band children (who thankfully were ok)
not want to go to parties
well that makes me
YIKE
well that's terrifying
there were restraining orders going around by the end of it too i think
yeah
which, honestly, it seemed like somebody was smoking something, so i also conjectured "maybe they got caught with something illegal and the cops showed up," but then i realized there weren't cops until like a minute in, which reaffirmed the shooting theory
ah so someone called the police
the police were there within a minute of all this occuring
did you call the police?
yikes
but i didn't know about this until well after the fact, so i thought i was in active shooting for a solid 5 minutes
i'm sorry though
that sounds fair, for the manager
and everyone just ran out cuz the manager got pissed or something
some idiots got high enough to stand on the tables and knock down an entire ceiling light/lamp thing
nope
and my first thought was "oh my god, this is a shooting, isn't it. oh my god"
i'm in the fucking road, so i can't drive away without hitting people (or other cars for that matter, as they immediately piled into cars)
like, there was shoving and visible panic
*everyone runs out at once*
and just as i drive close enough to fully comprehend just how many people are in there
so it was like looking at some weirdly themed rave of (probably high/drunk, which i later heard they were) high school students in a fast food restaurant
and i think eastlake kiddos (who made up the vast majority: it was like 3-4 eastlake people to every one skyline student) had like a hawaii themed game or something cuz they all had leis and flowered flannels on
like, everyone is fucking shoulder to shoulder in the mcdonald's
and then as i drive by the mcdonald's window, i see that the place is jam packed
and since band people have to put stuff away and socialize before they head out, we were all getting there late (granted, i was only driving myself anyways)
i later learned that both the skyline student section and the eastlake student section (they had their own home game tonight too) had decided to do a post-game thing at mcdonald's (again, this is why we don't like doing this after games)
the parking lot was fucking packed
so i drive through an abnormal amount of post-game traffic and get to mcdonald's
and i was like "eh, sure, i'll come along for the ride"
and at the end, they were making plans to chill at mcdonald's cuz it's kinda a band tradition to just get a small group of folks to chill there after we do something (usually concerts since games tend to attract some non-band people, but we do it on occasion)
naturally, i don't care about football and am just there to see my children
i was visiting some band folks cuz the first skyline football game was today
but here's the tea
so this happened a couple hours ago
no
I also have another topic, "Is happiness a limited resource?" but I think we'll save that one for another time
because that's what INFJs do best
I'm not really looking for a yes or no answer, just sharing my most recent moral dilemma with y'all
except that one time Henning locked down Skyline over a threat, but even then a firearm wasn't specifically involved
it's strange how we can have such strong opinions on such topics while their actual effects have never even graced our lives
at least not in a criminal sense
gun violence is a popular issue, but I have never actually been on the receiving end of a firearm, nor has anyone I have ever known
probably not much, right?
the stuff that if I had never heard about it, e.g. the college cheating scandal, what difference does it make if I had known or hadn't known?
I don't agree with being straight up ignorant of pertinent issues (stuff like global warming, local politics, and health concerns are important and should be known about) but
Is it selfish to not want to sully my enjoyment of my own life when there are others outside my daily life that are suffering?
Up until that point I was also under the camp of "being in the know is the way to go" but now that I realize how distant these things really are to me 90% of the time, why bother worrying about them if I have my own things I could be enjoying?
so I just don't allocate any energy into caring about the wider world right now
I have my own mental and physical issues to worry about, along with trying to do well in college
I'm very lucky that I can mostly live in a bubble and not have to care about what's going on outside of it
I just avoid the news at this point
I heard of none of it, and none of it would've affected me in the first place even if I had been in the states at the time
no having to hear about what stupid shit Trump did this time, no latest mass shooting reports, no more sad stories about people dying from preventable causes
and I felt much happier because of it
then I realized, when I was gone for a month I didn't hear about any of the bad stuff that was happening in the states
the news was showing the latest stories on the college celebrity cheating scandal, child shooting deaths, new carcinogens found in over the counter medication, and it occurred to me that if I hadn't turned on the TV at that moment I wouldn't have learned of any of that
but I'm kinda gung ho about the whole civic duty thing
imo yes
I came up with this question after watching the news for the first time after coming back from Japan
Is it selfish to choose to be ignorant of all the bad things outside what you actually encounter in your daily life?
... yup
Yeah didn't he divert military funds for that
Booooooooooo
thank you
fine, completely serious gayness rating
joke?
I've seen this joke on reddit so many times
**Why futa is less gay than straight porn**
Actually, futa can be made less gay than straight porn. You see, straight porn has one guy and one girl. Because you're fapping to something with one guy in it, that's 50% gay. If you watch futa fuck a girl, that's one girl and a half girl, thus only 25% gay. You could make it 0% gay with two girls but the problem is, that makes them lesbian, which wraps back to being 100% gay.
Jkjk
Bruh you need Jesus
Bruh futa is pretty good
But like wtf is happening rn
Okay ngl I love contrapoints’s vid on the question
*are traps gay*
Laughs in eternal dilemma of
What are you people doing in my good Christian Discord server?
What the hell?
Sorry Jarrett
And no I don’t speak the digits
I’m disturbed
Noah stop
"wait why does she have a bulge in her pants"
***Do you speak the digits?***
Why am I dating you
Noah
"why does she have a penis"
What
Lmao
and then the comments get flooded with 
"I don't understand the joke"
"what's with all the 6 digit numbers"
"can someone explain the numbers"
"why is my dick hard"
but sometimes they get on r/all
This can't be good
What's happening
I would say no
possibly?
Oh does Salina understand the digits?
-human
    -manga artists
        -manga artists that draws doujins
            -manga artists that draws doujins that watched Yuri on Ice
                -manga artists that draws doujins that watched Yuri on Ice that actually likes the show enough the commit the time to draw a doujin of it
*HMMMMM*
Hmmm
But this isnt bad
I aint even that gay
186336
out of the already limited pool of manga artists
I means you had 138 manga artists who were interested enough in the show to actually take the time to draw a doujin
you do realize each doujin requires a quite good manga artists to take a like 100+ hours to draw
Gay people *really* like the show though
Mistyped something
Ah sorry 370 explicit ones
Tbh gay shipping is pretty typical of like any random these days
Well there were 10.1k total
There would be a lot more if you search in japan
tbh 138 is pretty low
I have found only 150 doujins and 138 explicit fanfics
i'm not sure about the personalities
it's true that real life people inspired some of the characters but mostly design i think
maybe it exists in fanlore idk
no i have watched this show and there is no gay porn
hard to be unsure of gay porn parts lol
LOL
The gay porn part I am definetely sure of
https://www.pride.com/geek/2019/4/14/meet-real-skaters-who-inspired-these-yuri-ice-characters#media-gallery-media-0
are you sure?
There is a large amount of gay porn
And it being a sports show with a mostly male cast
Main character is based on him
like it's not based on him or anything
and afaik that has absolutely nothing to do with yuzu aside from whatever association anime fans might've come up with
wait also I just searched up yuri on ice having had no idea what it was
Which is why nathan is often the one breaking quad records but yuzu is generally held in higher regard. he's much more flowy and musical
But like if you compare yuzu to nathan, yuzu's got a similar if not better level of physicality and technical skill, but nathan focuses a lot more on showing off with power and athleticism
Yes, and they tend to suck
I was under the impression that they're all artsy and graceful
Also <@503787499605458954> can you have clinical, robotic, masculine style?
Gotta give the fans what they want
*he is required to be homosexual*
Didnt you see what Noah said?
I think people like saying he is bc his style is v artsy and graceful and "feminine"
I don't think he's gay but I mean he could be
He is required to make them happy
No no no, you don't understand, the fans dictate his sexual orientation
His fanbase heavily applied homosexuality to him
I mean his personal homosexuality is up in the air
*homosexual ice skating*
And this skater with homosexual vibes along with it
Thought she liked the anime
Never put 2 and 2 together
Well sorta
Didn't you know he was a real person back then?
Uh wasn't Blair obsessed with these people for a couple months?
Didnt know he was a real person
Huh
Ohhhh its the Yuri on ice guy
lmao what a mood
YEAH fans adore him for just falling randomly irl but being The Most Graceful on ice
yeah Yuzuru Hanyu. I think I saw a video of him doing a crazy spin on the ice and then it cut to a shot of him off the ice just walking and then falling over out of nowhere
weird combos, weird quads, repeatedly attempting and failing the quad axel etc lol
artur dmitriev isn't That Great of a competitive skater and he's basically dedicated his career to doing the wildest shit
yuzuru hanyu is super super famous and I love him sm he's so pure. if that's who you're talking about then yeah not surprised you've heard of him. he was gold at the last olympics and has been the reigning world champion for like 5 years, barring times when he's been injured. his story is super inspiring as well
i feel like i've heard of him even though i've never followed competitive ice skating
they all look like madlads
oh and if you get anything from the video just know that yuzu is a legend and artur dmitriev is an absolute madlad
they crazy
geez
really hope I get to see a quad axel landed at some point in my life (axels are especially hard bc by nature of the jump you need an extra half turn to land properly. so this would be 4.5 spins in the air before you land)
then thought physically impossible to achieve for women, but now here we are
they're insanely difficult, and for a long time thought physically impossible to achieve
quad jumps were not a thing until very recently (4 spins in the air before you land)
also kinda relevant to what I was saying about pushing the boundaries of the sport
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U1-2vFTigM
ok if you have 5 mins this isn't exactly on topic but has a lot of good examples of pro falls and will also give some cool other info
I'm trying to find a video example
yeah it does but like I said. a lot of them will just use their momentum to immediately push themselves back up if it's not a Bad fall
I don't even understand most of it
<@520095106888630348> it's complicated, really complicated
and yeah i was wondering what would happen if one of the professional figure skaters fell because that'd mess up their choreography
i sprained my wrist falling backwards onto my hands
like right now the boundaries of the sport are being pushed way more than people thought possible a decade ago it's been amazing
this is kind of a random tangent (I can talk about fs almost indefinitely) but it's a really great time to be a figure skating fan
also, it's easiest to stand back up from a kneeling position
but regardless, you'll notice that a lot of professionals get up and carry on so fast that sometimes you don't even realize they fell
once you get into jumps n shit falling gets a lot harder to control
falling backwards tends to be a lot more dangerous in that it's easier to hit your head or hit someone w your skates
you'll probably bruise but that's about it
if you're just skating normally it's typically best to fall forward onto your knees
moving out of the planning channel  <@!520095106888630348>
highkey uwo (the acronym) looks like a weird cross between uwu and owo
but we chillin 'cause ubc's better lol
my mom wanted me to apply there
neat
oh hey, UWO
is it like how much weight they can carry??
the entire car is built around working the tires, so it's really important to have this data
and I found it through that
and they had a link to Avons tire section for FSAE
I just happened to be on University of Western Ontario Motorsports (i.e FSAE) website looking through their "Useful Resources" links
and I've been aware/working around this cost for like 2 years now
but I didn't realize that until now
I assume to incentive people to buy them
the thing is Avon for some reason just posted their tire data to anyone wanting to buy their tires
normally it costs a team $500 (or an individual)
data on how tires work
dont know what that is
tire data
what did you save $500 on?
maybe one day
lot of things are, I don't have time to do all them
bruh it's so fucking fun
also I don't even know what one is
so I disagree with the `early 2000s romantic duets`
mostly because the current mood is "I just saved myself $500"
nope never been
do you not ice skate?
why did you choose now to jump in
incorrect
no
early 2000s romantic duets
blood
you know what's a Mood right now
yea they had to clean the blood off the ice before the pine lake kids could go on so we didn't have like any time to skate
rip!
do you know danielle miller? She got her head cut open with a skate on a choir fieldtrip
I also knew a girl who got a finger run over
one of my fs friends from way back got kicked in the stomach with a skate once
but I mean skating in general is p dangerous lol
generally not a great idea to pull more than one person, chains of people are usually forbidden
I know what I'm doing, no one's ever actually fallen when doing that
that sounds dangerous
i.e. you stand there and try not to fall over while I pull you really fast or skate backwards while tugging you along
one of my fave things to do is to just drag people around on ice
that's fine
i can really only go in circles
I'd love to go w you guys sometime though, I just realized no one here has been skating w me except helen and salina
I can still do a lot of tricks i.e. lunges, skating on one leg, going backwards, swizzles and twizzles, basic spins, slalom, crossovers, and a bunch of different types of stops, so I'm def overqualified for lessons. maybe I should look into coaching
I'm actually pretty confident that I could teach myself how to do things again if I just practiced a ton but it's basically impossible to have private space on ice and I don't wanna get in Actual figure skaters' way if I'm just messing around
ok skating regularly is a skill I've never lost, like I went with friends last week and I was miles better than everyone else even though they put me in hockey skates (yes there is a difference and it was awful and I'm never wearing them again lol) so the thing is going to public skate doesn't help me at all, it's just fun
go to one of the public skate times to get used to the space and skating again and then go to figure skate hours
you should do it!
this is one of the few times I will readily admit to being v intimidated
``full suit of armor``
it's not a good idea for your head to be near so many BLADES
i'll show up in a full suit of armor, not even wear skates, and then run into the rink and slide across the rink on my belly, plowing over anyone who dares stands in my way
i sprained my wrist ice skating once
bitch bring me
i can do bunny hops, me falling on my ass will distract from whatever you do
bring a friend
people are scary
well go to one and see
I get free admission to the ice rink here but I'm trapped in a weird limbo where I really wanna relearn how to jump but jumps/spins aren't allowed during public skate BUT I don't think I'm still good enough to go to the actual "reserved for figure skaters" practice time
hoes I miss skating
well
i misread things
oh
which is deeply unfortunate but whatever
there are hicks here, anyways it wasn't actually either of them, I'm talking about his new fiance
why does he support Trump if he's CANADIAN
yeah of course wdym lmao
this is my second favorite
moulin rouge is so good
WAIT ARE THEY CANADIANS?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1Oa39Uojj0
also their ending pose is supposed to symbolize ||satine dying|| (spoilers for moulin rouge) and I was simultaneously so happy and sad
ROXANNNEEEEEEEE
anyways
jackie
not tessa
now that i know she wore a maga hat prob not lmao
it's the song that freaked you out when i put it on fredboat <@!193229269076279298>
can I convert anyone else in this group to virtuemoir lovers bc I literally stan
I'm still depressed about them retiring but what a way to go out
she fucking backflips onto his shoulders
it's so so SO fucking good
and it's my favorite program from them ever
yes
they did MOULIN ROUGE?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOEKdWrtz6U
wait
ah yeah
shibutani siblings
who's?
but still weird
wait not olympics
it's a lil weird
ok i watched their 2018 olympics performance and u right
oh btw even outside the relationship thing almost no one in the fs community isn't obsessed with tessa/scott. they're the most decorated figure skaters of all time for good reason, they're insanely good ~~and I still think they got cheated out of gold in 2014~~
/end long fs rant
my point is not that it's weird if ice dance partners aren't romantically involved, but that because it's often much easier to hook an audience with a love story on ice it's more difficult for the shibs. which is why I personally and a lot of judges find their performances kinda bland sometimes. for one, like I said earlier, they're not That impressive technically, but also they suck at storytelling bc I don't think they've figured out what story to sell yet, which is at least partially bc they're siblings
which, I don't think they've succeeded in yet
if the audience is acutely aware that they're brother and sister they gotta find some other way to be equally interesting
it's not weird if they're not dating but a huge part of the performance is often to sell that story
but because it's frequently performed as a romantic story it's harder for siblings to succeed
it's not
good for them, but that doesn't mean it's weird if they're not dating
not always, apparently
do they know it's all part of the act?
the thing is it's REALLY common for ice dance partners to be or become romantically involved
no they just know it's part of the act
Hollywood actors do far more with each other for movie scenes but no one says "oh it's weird if they're not dating"
it's part of the act
that's all
they're actors
I'm just saying it's stupid for people to act weird about it
<@!503787499605458954> no I get it
exactly, Nicholas got invited by some of the cheerleading girls *and guys* to come and try out
*noah* shhh
you don't
idk how to properly communicate this to someone who probably doesn't watch it
listen, ice dance, atmospherically, is so different from even pair skating
(cough nicholas)
cheerleading often has guys
if muay thai you're supposed to thrust your hips so they're in front of the rest of your body when clinching, no one bats an eye when you do it
acrobatics are more about like awe and stuff
like cheer is about stunting and hype
yes, but a) heteronormativity, i.e. cheerleaders are all girls so no one cares, and b) ice dance is a storytelling performance, it;s not the same at all
but i feel like the general atmosphere of those sports are diff
it's just part of the sport
I mean no one comments on acrobats or cheerleaders, etc on grabbing people in weird places
sorry sorry
*incest*
and why I think it's a disadvantage that the shib sibs have to religiously avoid it
which is part of why it's often played off as a romantic story
it's just hard to do a lot of the crazy athletic shit and make it look good as hell without touching weird places
if you wanna search it up
I'm thinking of the beginning of carmen
it's a legit move that's part of the performance
ok but
this description is weird
`hands wandering into inner thigh area` they're not high schoolers dating
"Virtue and Moir tweak provocative lift at Olympics to be more family-friendly"
this had to be a legit headline
*welp*
idk, I kinda get it
neck and hair caresses, hands wandering into inner thigh area, lifts and spins where her legs are literally around his neck, etc etc etc etc
that sounds more like a problem with the people commenting on it rather than the performers
I'M NOT WRONG THOUGH
sorry sorry
bc *sexual tension*
virtuemoir are a PRIME example of this
there's a lot of stuff that's just awk if you're siblings, a lot of people have commented on it actually
typically, you're performing as a couple
why?
the sibling thing
tbh that's kind of a disadvantage in ice dance
not jarrett's speed if you know what i mean
I tentatively like them, but I've heard a lot about how they've only gotten this far bc their parents are hella rich
well they're v wholesome siblings
rip?
they're not even top 20 on world standings rn, though idk if I agree w that
in comparison
their technique is not great
and they're relatively young?
aren't the shibutanis still p solid
they're so skewed lmao
I just checked ISU's world standings
wait holy fuck
they're all getting kinda old rip
yuzuru's probably also retiring soon which is extremely sad (another goat, does insane quads, consistent world champ from japan)
I'm v curious to see who will fill the ice dance power vacuum now that virtuemoir are retired
this is like the only sport I still actively pay attention to lol
then again a lot of the fs community are middle-aged canadian women who have probably been following tessa/scott since they first started drawing attention like 15 years ago
yike
hm interesting. idk then
I have found 0 record of her skating career online so I assume she wasn't great
I actually have no idea how people in the fs community knew who she was lol
her only claim to fame is that she's scott's gf/fiance and former skating partner
in comparison
not really
mb then
well
hm
she's not famous
if i were famous and was caught wearing a maga hat ironically, i would be really fucking sure the world knew it was ironic. but honestly, it's kinda hard to wear a maga hat ironically cuz people get the wrong impression, especially if you're famous
oh well. hope it turns out well for em
who knows maybe the hat was ironic
but I am a sad canadian
anyways the news came out a few weeks ago, I haven't been paying as much attention to skating related to stuff lately
oh boy
............oh
make america great again lol
I can take tessa/scott as friends they're still adorable either way I just expected scott and jackie to break up bc honestly he can do better
what's a maga hat?
also there are pics circulating of her wearing a maga hat which is v unfortunate
partially bc I was a lowkey virtuemoir shipper but also bc his fiance (jackie) is supposedly a catty bitch (according to the fs community)
why?
#deathofvirtuemoir
This is literally irrelevant to all of you probably but Scott Moir is engaged and I'm kinda upset
Thank
gene ily
Yeah, you can't hit on everyone you find attractive. Otherwise, my face would be bruised up from me punching myself.
I'm prob not gonna actually do anything about that
but like
I think several of my closest friends here are hot as shit
and just bc I've checked em out doesn't mean I'm necessarily gonna hit on them
It can be weird depending on the context, but I don't think you've come anywhere near crossing that line
I just notice people I find attractive I don't think that's weird
and it's not like I was Trying
most people just aren't as open about it
Na that's not it, most people don't comment on it so much
And 1*2=2, so if you only factor in just now, the math checks out
The only person I'm checking out is my reflection
I'm bi, I check twice as many people out as y'all heteros, idk why this is surprising
<@503787499605458954> You really like checking people out don't you
Still, a 1/4 chance is p neat
reminder that I go to a huge-ass school
At least the branches are smaller
Damn
Holy shit
my branch is floors 2-5
20 floors
catch me actually attending all the branch activities from now on lmao
How big is your dorm?
Hopefully you see them again soon then
Oh no :(
I think she might be on my floor but I didn't get a chance to ask either of their names 😦
there's also an asian girl who was v cute
I'm sure you'll run into him again
Fair enough
there were a few, actually, but that guy's the one who stuck out to me
Knock on every room asking for cute guys
have confirmed that he's not on my floor, sadly
so that's like combination of personality and looks lol but he was super sassy and winked at everyone and all the thirst aside I wanna be friends
I thought that was some sort of pretentious shirt
ok more than appearance i have a HUGE Thing for people who know how attractive they are
I am just now realizing that was toilet paper
then we had a "fashion show"
we had a branch meeting, we did a thing where we dressed up "models" in toilet paper n random shit
lol
Also, I can't tell you how cute the guy is without seeing more of his face, but I trust your taste. However, that balloon is kinda wack in that shot.
yeah!!
I spot one (1) Melena
i could make so many jokes right now good lord
*academic* reasons
am i supposed to think you wanna get into that room for
So it's not that weird
Ok for context we live in the same building and he's in my branch
lmao
this is like telling jane she's a sweatshirt/jacket/blanket klepto
as if you weren't in stalker territory already
` I really wanna know what floor he's on`
mmmh
I'm sad I couldn't get a good pic of his face without being a creeper
sliding into that room?
something about..
HIGHKEY this guy is Super Cute and I really wanna know what floor he's on
Nice
yike
tea haul
I feel like I leveled up and gained conversational skills
And while there were some awkward moments, it was a mostly competent conversation
I had a hour-long conversation with a complete stranger on the plane
Some fucking tea
Jarrett is out here having height standards whereas I'm over here with my only standard being "doesn't say 'it's what it's'"
No
It fills you with dread but you know it's still correct
Love that phrase
I hate you, Jarrett. Why would you pin that?
Well of course
That's within the 3" range
What if you were 5'2"?
Would have to strongly consider
So 4'11.5" is just a no?
I know what you mean, but please don't ever do that again or else I will revoke your privilege of using contractions on behalf of the entire English-speaking community
Ok, that was by far the most cursed thing you've said today
It's what it's
Geez
You people and your standards
But that 3 plus minus range is where its at
I'll go down to 5 ft and up to 7
I know
<:TH:605635628205604885>
``fine but not optimal``
Tom Holland's ass is optimal, but that's way too high of a standard for anyone else, so I think you're being too picky
Yes yes
What do you think `you've met a 5'8" woman before` means
I know it it's
Its fine but not optimal
5'8" isnt that uncommon Noah
If it's named Noah, it's a dick
Seeing as the dick and the clit are made of the same tissue, at what point doing it count as a dick vs a clit?
I vote we all go visit Helen, but we have the guys stand outside at all times so we're forced to converse at the doorway. I'll lay down in the doorway with my waist up inside and my waist down outside the dorm during the conversation.
doesn't that seem a little unfair
so it's always gonna be at their place
really?
No dicks allowed in my dorm, it's in my roommate agreement form
Also just go visit <@472541429130854421>'s dorm
But you've met a 5'8" woman before
ive never actually met a 6'6" woman
yeah but
That makes more sense.
Height, ok.
Oh wait
I'm back and still confused
So idk if you're right
Currently rocking 5" up without any problems
especially up
any more and its a little much
Why 3"?
Yes you did
damn there was a dick joke in there I just glossed over
3" up or 3" down
So her plus her dick is your height
Really, you think the difference is optimally 3"?
if im 6'4" ideally theyre 6'1"+
gotta ramp it up
fair
<@173668455856340994> why do you need a 5'10"+ person if you're 6'4"?
Wait
26.8F-ZZ:Format Q
*visible confusion*
Do you not like 18F style girls in B format with a height version of 5.10+
... ok?
Pure culture
I don't understand these numbers
What am I reading
18F style girl in B format height version 5.10+
I'd like a 12F style girl, with an B format
*format*
Very few girls come in a 5'10"+ format
But again
6'4" isnt that far off of my current height so a small increase wouldn't be bad
Second
First of all that's a great point that I didn't consider Noah
And then I take it he doesn't care much for being 6'4"?
If he could be 5'2" and a cute girl, he's down
I'm curious as to what you mean
Explain
Yes and no
No
Anyone ever simultaneously wish they could be 5'2" and 6'4"?
It's ok. They had fun and didn't die. Mission accomplished I suppose.
yikes!
I love them, but sometimes I really worry for them
And she doesn't gamble at all
Hell, my mom wanted to go gambling in the casino because of some deal tied to the buffet thing
I feel like my parents are prime targets for tourist traps
(also apparently they did fireworks shows at the falls every night this summer up until last night, when summer ended. My parents went back while I'm chilling in the hotel room because they apparently shines lights on the falls or something, and honestly, the thought just makes me really sad, so I didn't go. At that point, I'd be willing to believe the entire falls themselves were artificial if I didn't know any better)
I mean, I didn't if that helps
Don’t get bitten by squirrels
Had to cut off a little bit on the left because of one of the tour boats
Here's the best pretty picture I could get of them with my shit ass phone camera
<@503787499605458954> sorry if you thought if I was gonna insult the falls themselves though
I had to politely shake off a lot of attempts for pictures and grimaced through the ones I couldn't get out of cuz it was kinda hard to look at
I did the boat cuz my parents wanted to, and I had a "yikes" thing across my face the entire time. My parents were having the time of their life and literally couldn't tell the difference from this and protected natural sites when I asked them later (and they've gone to a shit ton of national parks)
bitch
I thought you were gonna insult the actual falls and I was like
yeah I wish it was protected
but
as someone who has done both the boat and the zipline, they're really fun
I will say
Zipline
I agree
yes
that
ah
Some of the other pictures are a bit too big for Discord
They even had those banners that you see on the lightposts at Disneyland advertising the company that did the boat rides
It was a couple rollar coasters away from being a theme park, and that's a depressing thought
Like, I knew it was bad since I know Niagara Falls doesn't have national park protection, but dear god
Well, some of the things I saw include but are not limited to:
-private company taking people into the water for what's effectively a wet ride
-a ferris wheel
-two casinos
-a motorized viewing pod elevator thingy
-a zipline
-hotels pretty much right there
-a fuckton of other man-made shit 
-litter pretty much everywhere (so many cigarette butts dear god)
Shit, no I don't
Since the previous complaint about the buffet wasn't very eloquent, lemme see if I have some pictures to do this right
*inhales*
you're gonna have to elaborate on that one buddy that's like. a national insult
???????????
Niagara Falls was depressing shit
If I wanna complaim about something a bit more important
damn
I'm wondering if this is the worst meal I've endured in my 18 years of life, and signs are beginning to point towards yes
But at the same time
Which makes me hate myself
I sound like a fucking Yelp reviewer
glad I wasn't there
I am rarely grossed out by food or picky by any means (I like pineapple on pizza, enjoy most fast foods, and ate school lunch like every day), but hell, I'd be more willing to eat fries off a McDonald's floor than some of that stuff.
after that glowing recommendation
I know I sound really stuck-up right now, but it was one of those "you had to be there" things in hindsight
The problem was that my parents like unironically enjoyed it. Like, bitch, they're some of the most amazing home cooks I've ever met (granted, I'm biased, but that's been backed up by everyone who I've ever seen try their food), and they got multiple plates full of shit. I am positive a good chunk of the food their was reheated frozen food that had been sitting out to rot for hours, absorbing cigarette smoke for hours as the casino's guests (who, not to be rude, made me question their life choices given that they were at a casino on a Tuesday night, but I'm sure most of them are fine people) have been messing with food enough to get people to argue with each other about kicking people out.
But the point isn't that the food was bad (I'm mainly listing for reference). There's bad food everywhere, and I'd be snobbish to expect good food from a casino buffet.
Fried chicken tasted overly greasy. Tasted like reheated fried chicken from QFC. Was still ok.
Vegetable spring rolls were actually the one thing that was decent. They were far from anywhere near authentic, but from a place trying to serve American, Asian, Mediterranean, and pizzas+salads at once, what the hell did you expect.
Shepherd's pie was nast. I've gotten way better shit frozen. It had the consistency of puke.
Mac and cheese was palatable on the first bite before I realized I'd rather be eating Kraft.
A cut of beef was just rubbery and flavorless, but I guess that's inoffensive.
I think there was like some squash? It was somehow worse than the shepherd's pie.
There was something else, but my memory has already blocked it out, and it's been less than an hour (it was a buffet, so there was a lot of things)
I think of the various things I tried
I specifically got things that I saw the peoe working there put out fresh to make sure no one else had touched it first
Which was a solid reminder of why self-serve can be iffy
When I went to get food, first thing I overheard was a man yelling "THEY SHOULD KICK YOU OUT OF HERE. THAT'S DISGUSTING. YOU CAN'T JUST PUT FOOD LIKE THAT BACK AFTER YOU'VE TAKEN IT"
Which, it's a buffet, so it's probably been sitting out for hours
I had no fucking idea it was possible to make food as bad as some of that shit looked
And the food oh god
It was like $20 per person, so it wasn't cheap either, especially since I already wasn't hungry or gonna eat much
oof
Everything reeked of cigarettes smoke, so I wanted out as soon as possible
But oh dear god
And this might (is probably) the sheltered-ass Sammamish kid speaking out
Which, while I've had decent experiences with buffets in the past, that's because you can tell a kid anything about a restaurant and they'll probably believe it
But like my parents chose to eat at the fucking buffet
I have a small degree of hope because the hotel dude (who works here and has a degree of respectability) was like "yeah, there's like 10 different restaurants in there with varying levels of quality" (it was a big casino)
If that doesn't scream "this is a bad decision," I don't fucking know what does
Which
So my parents decide to go to the fucking casino across the street
But it's like not a huge town, so there's very little to pick from
And my parents want something to eat
But tonight, we're in a hotel somewhere south of the border
(which, tbf, I like fast food, so I guess that's cheating)
But dear god, I've been away for nearly a week, and the fucking Popeyes at the Detroit airport was one of the best meals I've had so far
Did not realize how bad it was before this trip
So my parents are apparently shit when it comes to picking places to eat
Ok
text
I'm like the only person actually available rn I think so
Would y'all prefer this in video call form or text form?
But first might I ask
<@503787499605458954> (still not used to the new nickname but I like it) knows what's up
LET'S GOOOOO
Boy oh boy do I have some fucking tea to spill
Hey, friends
:)
and that means Herc likes you
therefore she is a source of pets, scratches, food, and heat
Salina is now no longer a threat
Herc either thinks you're a threat or not
but yay good that she can go around without being attacked
i dont understand how it went from "Herc attacks her" to "herc loves her" all of a sudden
What if Herc doesn't like her the next time?
Ah, no
Will lick Salina
Herc probably likes the smell of pizza
Pizza smells good
<@258094439636008971> I'm lost, pizza?
Also, these pictures are super damn wholesome
Did you eat pizza before seeing Herc?
Wholesome image
i have finally assimilated
i am worthy
That's wholesome
Awww
:D
Herc likes Salina now
Not having a great day to say the least
But does anyone have any like, good news or something?
Uh, so idk where to put this
Idk, Asian's age are hard to judge
Tbf, I think looking like you're in your 20s is the goal at most stages of life
I don't think I have a good frame of reference for this
I think I look p young but most strangers guess that I'm in my 20s
Idk
I don't particularly care either way, but I always just assumed I did
Do I not look my age?
A child
If I don't look like an adult, what do I look like?
does this mean that to strangers Gene looks like an adult
wait
LMAO
Damn
Not sure to make of the whole experience, but ok I guess lol
Other notable quips from these guys I met in the hotel elevator include but are not limited to:
"I love fuckers"
"Do you know our room?" *proceeds to give me their room number*
"I'm sorry about this motherfucker"
I was in a elevator with 4 half-naked guys (who seemed drunk and like they just came back from swimming) who asked me in a French accent if I knew who Drake was, started laughing, and then asked if I had cheesecake
I thought it's easier to hack devices connected to the same WiFi?
Safety hazard?
That's still really fucking neat though
Isn't public WiFi kinda a safety hazard sometimes though?
Lmao
anyway have fun in toronto!! 3rd favorite canadian city
and it's actually good
it's amazing
van has free government-sponsored wifi across the city proper
some magical ass tea
dude
Y E S
wait omg I found it
https://tenor.com/view/dont-do-that-avengers-black-panther-we-dont-do-that-here-gif-12042935
*t'challa voice* we don't do that here
YEEHAW
WELCOME
Just crossed the border into Canada
Large cranium
kidnap them and make them come with you
I won't see Scott and Courtney the rest of the trip, and I'm kinda sad about that. I know I've said this before, but they're pretty damn awesome. I have amounts of respect for them that rival Noah's respect for Nicholas.
Scott and Courtney gave us theirs, so now we have 5 tea things with us, and I find this amazing
The bride and the groom gave everyone things of tea as gifts at the wedding
Yeah, that sounds smart. Thanks.
Well if you're not into it then I'd just leave it be
rip
Eh, ima let it be. If it was supposed to be discreet, it's probably discreet for a reason. I was already polite about it, so that's probably enough to call it a day. I ask randomly personal shit at weird hours too, so might as well not overthink it.
I just got asked if I was into guys at 5:30AM PST by a loose friend. Granted, I get the question a fair bit, but am I supposed to read into that or let it be?
Also, I love how you told us this in the channel literally named "the TEA"
Public education has truly failed us
Hmm really makes you think
Well
I have just discovered that both parrot and ferret have only one T too
Wait fuck
Jarrett the parrott
In elementary school I had 3 nicknames
See thats the thing
stew on it
that has been writing your name as jarret the whole time
there is a carrot
somewhere in the world
okay well
what the literal fuck
My life is a lie
I have just discovered that carrot is spelled with one T
damn if you waited just two more months it would have been almost exactly a year
S L O R P
There was an odd sense of deja vu
Matt just spilled some tea on my pants
I had no idea they were a thing ngl
my boujee ass does that just by living
lol
You'll kill the environment
Don't
But like
me and Salina are long distance as well, but I could technically come back every weekend if I really wanted to
I wish them luck
that's proper long distance
do you find it trippy bc it happened so late or because neil spent a long time chasing april
Yeah
is she going to UW?
But hope it works out for em
Highkey I still find it so trippy that they're a Thing
I just had a dream that I was playing Minecraft with Tom Holland
What a shock
Rip?
Lmao????
Just really unnerving
It wasn't uncomfortable or painful
Like, I could hear/feel it rotating in my back
So that was terrifying
And I am deathly terrified of being reminded that I'm a bag of flesh and bones
I could hear my spine move
So I got bored and started stretching and dear god
And that's the tea
We all put here spilling coffee
So really
And coffee is bean tea
Spilling the tea and spilling tea beans pretty much mean the same thing
Y'all, I just realized something wild
Uhm
Damn
it's for the Asian audience
It's a forbidden snacc
yea they taste like cats and dogs
there's a taste?
I keep forgetting
They wanted to taste it
Yeah
yea the coating they put on them
oh lol
<@472541429130854421> <@520095106888630348> nooooo I forgot to let you guys taste the Switch cartridges
Idk I don't give this much thought
Uh
Idk how to answer this tbh
What animal do you most identify with?
How about this
No?
Answer the question Gene
I regret starting this conversation
What's your fursona y'all?
minus the fursuit
make your furrsona come to life
Why do I not doubt this isn't already a thing
Please consider: VR furry porn
Doesn't make it less cursed though
Nope
You gotta problem with people enjoying themselves <@173668455856340994>?
I feel like that's gonna be done soon (although it is indeed very cursed). But we all have another 60 years or so to live. Think of how much stuff has been invented in the past 60, and consider that we're advancing faster than ever. I am terrified, cuz it's gonna be something we haven't even thought up yet
And also very likely to be invented
VR sex is seems pretty cursed to me
If you want my honest opinion Gene
Lmao
Cuz I'm highkey kinda terrified now
What the most cursed thing that's gonna be invented in our lifetimes is?
Do y'all ever wonder just like
So I just realized that like, barring a tragic event, we're gonna live a decent amount of time
I like it
ooooooooooh
oooh
So. 10/10
It was super cute though boba was excellent and they also did bubble waffles, crepes, fried snacks and Asian ice cream
This was probably the most aggressively Asian boba shop I've ever been to
<@478706068223164416>
With a ton of sugar
It tastes like an asianified latte
Coffee milk tea is good, however, I am still unsure if there's any actual tea in it
False, and it's not a thing because that sounds nast
And that's the tea
Because coffee is tea
I wonder why coffee mixed with tea isn’t a thing
Jasmine oolong and Java oolong
here's the mother fucking tea
bean tea
<:NR:605639306572464128>
Lol
lmao
Then go on the offensive and ask them what their Christian Mingle accounts are
at that point i'd just lie and say that you are a christian
Omg
HAHAHA
You don't take something just cuz 2 buff Christian dudes give it to you
2 buff Christian dudes gave it to me
Why do you have that
Coulda joined the gang
That's a shame
It took like a solid 5 mins to get rid of them even though I said I wasn't interested immediately
Yes
Did you just give up a free book of mormon?
I am deeply uncomfortable
Two buff tattooed Christian dudes just came up to me and offered me free bibles
It basically just sounds like UW
I'm not too concerned if that happens
beware of windup clowns
you gucci
as long as you don't carried off by a carnival of terror

LMAO
The wolves/coyotes sound like angry monkey blood demons
<@!503787499605458954> haunted woods throwback
I think the woods behind my house are haunted
especially to someone who hasn't done something like skateboarding either
the physics of it look really cool to do but the learning curve is definitely bigger
i hate having two feet stuck together lol
I actually think I like snowboarding better now but I'm a LOT worse at it
maybe i'll try again some day
i tried snowboarding once and noped out of it hella quick
i love skiing though it's been years since i last went
I used to be good at it when I was a kid but hated it for some reason. It's been years, but I know exactly what I'd have to do if I bothered to get the right equipment since my knees aren't shit yet. I'd be glad to ski with friends if presented the opportunity.
as in I started doing it but got lazy and distracted
I have like half a bucket list written out
oh I spaced and didn't read anything after the northern lights stuff
winter sports are in my blood
yes!!
Can y'all ski?
Oh shit
I still haven’t ever gone skiing or snowboarding
I’m down for wintery shenanigans
Lol
the one time I sleep early
wait I'm mad
that depends on how much snow we get
I also always wanted to go sledding with y'all
Yesss
we could attempt baking the pieces ourselves instead of buying the set
same, i've never had my own gingerbread house before i think
I've always wanted to make gingerbread houses!
seriously we should do some christmassy things together during winter break like decorate a tree or make gingerbread houses
DECEMBER PLANS LET'S GOOOOO
go skiing with friends
decorate a christmas tree lmao
WE STILL GOT TWO WEEKS TO DO THAT WHAT'S LEFT ON THE LIST??
i made a list of things i wanted to do before going to college and didn't do half of them
i don't
like an actual list written out somehwere?
do you guys have real bucket lists?
Keep it short and come up with new things along the way
If it's too long, you'll just give up
don't die early
hey the less you complete your bucket items the less of an excuse you have to die early
That's like a bucket list before death item for me
Damn
Fuck dude what
Includes a time lapse: https://komonews.com/weather/komoloz/photos-northern-lights-make-rare-appearance-in-seattle
It night happen again tonight, but it seems unlikely. I'm gonna look more into it. Worst case scenario, I'll find footage from last night.
Apparently it's a struggle to forecast, so that's why a lot of people didn't know
whoa i missed that too
But like just shat away my time lol
And I was awake
Apparently there were northern lights in Washington last night
Well, I'm a real fucking idiot
imo it cleanses the palate better than other teas
I really have only drank bo lei, oolong, and green tea
`Not suitable for beginners`
Fuck you
no swears
jane
What the fuck does that mean
<@460689096646590465>
<@173668455856340994>
I imagine its smoky, grounded, incense-esqe flavor is popular among older folks
Not suitable for beginners, but very enjoyable to more seasoned drinkers
It's a very strong, rich scented tea, with an almost heavy mouth feel
I didn't give my super detailed opinion before because I was hazy on what it tasted like but now that I have it in front of me
boulei
I'll play people's games, they won't
That's the difference between me and my brother and sister-in-law lmao
If I'm in Gene mode, I'm running the guantlet (as in, running through it)
If I'm in Scott&Courtney mode, I'm *running* the guantlet (in charge)
Tbf, depends what you mean
*I knew they had a purpose*
*Yes*
Really crazy seeing someone else run the gauntlet
<:GW:605629892679434260> ❤ <:NR:605639306572464128>
<:DG:605635901871226908> g'night (also, idk about the spicy debate channel because encouraging this too much sounds unhealthy, but that's a decision for us to make later as a group)
Na it was me
Night Gene 🤗
I though Cindy did that?
I think the spicy debate channel is needed again (but it got turned into the pokemon channel (technically by me))
Love you, Noah ❤
Yeah, let's call it
Its not worth it
Actually, eh
I'm in the middle of typing something, but once I'm done sure. We can pick it up another time
Let's call it for tonight
Tl;dr: I'm throwing shade at specific methods and tendencies, not you as a person/friend or personality because I love those
<@193229269076279298> for context, I still love you and am not actually pissed (and somewhat enjoy this type of foundations-level discussion). I'm just naturally gonna channel this energy at 2:30 AM when disagreeing with someone. This is my "Scott and Courtney" mode, so if it bites, you'll know where I learned it from. If you need a break and a hug, just remember I respect your differing opinions and you as a person.
Tl;dr: about two feet away from either giving someone a concussion or commiting second-degree murder (hey, I mean, maybe it would've been a light bop and things would've been fine, but the back of the head is frail af, and idk how healthy the dude is) because I'm a dumbass. Lesson learned: don't be stupid in public by aimlessly launching projectiles near a crowd.
So naturally we got yelled at, I apologized, and awkwardly shuffled away considering the fact that I nearly killed a man at a random event I was second-handedly invited to by my friend
And for a while this was true until I kinda accidentally ripped one really far, but because I rarely swing left-handed and had little control of where the ball was going, it landed like two feet away from some rando's head who was looking away and just waiting in line
My dumbass says "well, let's just swing left-handed. I can't hit it hard enough to get enough power nor lift to be of any threat to anyone"
No, no
Now, at this point, I realized "ok, this isn't smart, let's stop"
We found some open space and had about half the field (whole thing was around the size of a football field, maybe a liiiiittle less), and after swinging right-handed, I realized I easily got it far enough down the field where there were other people. Thankfully, I hit it straight away cuz I still had not terrible form, and all the people were off to the sides
I was at like some Microsoft event cuz my friend invited me, and there was like an open field with some sports stuff, including a bat and some softballs, and I was like, "oh, ok, I haven't swung a bat in a while, so I convince my friend to throw a few for me"
Tea: I almost accidentally gave a rando a concussion today
i don't have the time at the moment, but i'll be sure to give it a read a little later!
Also 538 is one of my fave independent news sources if anyone wants less biased coverage
I love this series and this interview was fascinating if anyone wants to give it a read and hmu

if anyone ever asks me why i'm a mariners fan ever again, i'm gonna cite this trade as evidence that it's because they're a huge-ass mood
called out
lmao wow
Shouldn't've doubted the man with 100 days more anime watched than me
<@233062637922025472> you right
getting technical up in here
wow
both refer to the same hiragana for もう
もう can be either mou or "mo" with an accent mark above the o
romaji is not standardized very well
https://jisho.org/search/mouichido
「もう一度」
「もう」だ、「も」じゃない
正解だ
Mo without the accent mark is absolutely incorrect
You just add the u when you can't add an accent mark, makes the same sound
Plus Mo with the accent mark is the same as Mou
Are you doubting the 100% correct romajidesu dictionary?
http://www.romajidesu.com/dictionary/meaning-of-mouichido.html
lol welcome back to being awake
Update: fell asleep
Woke up to find that the Mariners traded Leake
Astros pulled off a crazy ass deal for Greinke
y
Are you doubting the 100% accurate google translate?
Nani?
No I'm pretty sure it's mou
Its not the mou shinderu mou
<@233062637922025472>
It's mo not mou
Wait wait no
Mou ichido
You got it wrong haha
Jarrett did you attempt a Japanese pun?
did someone say lofi?
Lofi?
have you listened to my lo-fi hip hop playlist?
<@470822754262712329>
nani the fuck
That's not saying much. <@470822754262712329>'s pretty high up there.
I'm lower than starbot now
Damn
gene and starbot getting it *on*
wow
hell yeah motherfucker
<@470822754262712329> oh yes, fuck me 😉
no fuck you
To be fair, the Mariners had some allegations of some real sus shit break out over the offseason, and I have a lot less faith in the front office and ownership than I used to, but it's kinda hard to follow who was an asshole and who wasn't. I'm kinda lucky as a Mariners fan that the players tend to be respectable human beings though (and if they don't, the front office yeets their ass out the door as soon as they find out). The upper levels of the organization are an enigma and kinda problematic, but there's so much swept under the rug where I can point to like two individuals and be like "fuck you for sure" and awkwardly sweep my pointing around the rest of the room like "fuck you guys I guess? I don't know? Maybe? I kinda wanna believe in you guys, but fuck y'all just in case"
He's probably as controversial as baseball players get aside from the ones with actual domestic violence allegations and whatnot like Osuna and Chapman (fuck those guys even more)
I think Bauer has openly stated shit about not believing in climate change and being a Trump supporter while just generally being a dickhead to other people. But he's also weirdly smart about what he does (his pitching preparation process is way better than what's traditionally done, and I honestly wished it was anyone but this headass pushing this stuff forward).
Regardless, I'm glad the Mariners stay away from guys like this
Puig is weirdly tempermental, but Bauer is way more of a tool
Bauer's last game was him yeeting a ball over the center field wall in frustration from the picther's mound
Yeah, that happened yesterday. Bauer was more of the headliner though.
Love that he was in a fight in his last l game there
I did see Puig get traded
Strickland to the Nats as well, apparently in a separate transaction
Michael Jordan to the Birmingham Barons
O shit
Ha ha very funny
Kevin Durant to the Astros
Twins dun did it too
Elías to the Nationals
I think the Mariners dun did it
Hahahaha
I wish I was half as smooth
Weeb summoning
<@233062637922025472> <@478706068223164416>
Kay that joke was pretty lit and you probably dont understand it
Yes, they're going to trade an injured player for a retired player. That's how it works.
Mo Ichiro
Call it
Have a whole campaign
Theyre gonna trade Felix Hernandez to Japan in exchange for Ichiro
Also, that's not a trade
He just retired
Let the man rest
No
They gonna re-sign ichiro
They might not, but still
If they plan on doing something, this is IB levels of procrastination
I'm gonna spend the next three hours internally screaming because it's 3 hours until the trade deadline, and the Mariners still haven't done jackshit
or is this a ploy to get me to add my roommate here in the fall? 🤔
How do we change or add emojis?
i like how y'all just took this random dude's dog ya didn't know lmao
that's not what i'm saying
<:SZ:605640671830736896>
Don't be speciesist gene
Because the dog deserves it
<:DG:605635901871226908> wait so why did we make my roommate's dog into a custom emoji lmao
Thats what I always thought, but now I'm second-guessing myself
never considered this but I always thought of it as short for suspicious
*I want answers*
rip
Ok, so when we say something is "sus," do we mean it's "suspicious" or "suspect." I just realized they mean the same (or at least really similar) thing in the context, and it bothers me now.
i'm intrigued but can't listen in unfortunately 😦
sure
Are we all allowed to listen lmao
WAIT HELLO
Sec
<@!173668455856340994>
alright let's goooo
Oh actually I see now
Idk what you wanna rant about but sure
<@193229269076279298> yeah sure
Ping me when this goes down
I wanna witness this
Lemme get back home
Oh boy
anyone want to call and listen to me rant
but I don't care enough to type them all up
I have lots to say on this
Lol
And realized that maybe Cindy isn't representative of all gals
I have since matured
Seems about right
Lmao
the writing itself was p cringe though
maybe "very" mature was a stretch but like the parts about not giving up friends for relationships
yeah the part salina pointed out was the biggest Yikes for me
Her: Really? Okay then I guess you dont listen to me
Me: I have never in my life heard of X
Her: well I think you shouldve known to get me X
Me: Why?
And she said something like "oh. I thought you would get me X"
I had just gotten her something I believe
And I realize in hindsight that a lot of what I referred to as hinting was just being passive-aggressive
I was pretty mad when I wrote that bit
O man
I feel like I don't really want to read this now lol
i feel like i could make a pretty good case at which chapter is which people
ye
Sounds p angsty to me
yikeroo
like a monument to my angst
its a good read
no gene
i mean true
The part where it finally decided to end
what parts were mature?
damn
C o n f u s e d  t e s t o s e r o n e
Yay I love male teen angst
~~ok most of it~~
some parts I thought was a lot of Male Teenager Angst
Sophomore Jarrett? Mature?
some parts I thought were actually very mature
yeah
Maybe in the morning lol
You have my interest
this can be the summer reading socsem you asked for
anyways do it I wanna discuss sometime
wow, if only the corporations controlling the internet were like you
Which is wack now that I say it out loud
Haven't bothered to because I (for the moment) respect Jarrett's privacy even if he doesn't
btw, I read the whole thing and idk how I feel about it
Ok, that second one actually looks less experimental and more edible (there was originally gonna be avocado, but it made no sense whatsoever)
Attempt at something different (in no particular order again):
-toasted sourdough
-scrambled egg
-bacon/turkey bacon
-thinly sliced steak
-melted gruyere or gruyere and aged cheddar
-carmelized onions
-a little bit of diced bell pepper if room
(Basically a bastardized Philly cheese steak on sourdough with some breakfast thing crammed in)
I'm sure I could reason what would be a good or bad idea if I had things in front of me
It's a pretty ambitious sandwich that'll probably be a mess, and I came up with most of it on the fly, so something is bound not to mix well
I'm just stabbing in the air cuz I've never tried this before (in no particular order for now):
-Brioche bun
-Breakfast sausage patty
-Deli turkey slices
-Scrambled egg (I'd consider something else though)
-Hashbrown or thinish avocado slices (or just skip this altogether)
-Brie
-Just a little bit of arugula
-Tomato slices
-Mayo and whole grain Dijon mustard (alternatively: remove tomato slices and replace with hot sauce to lean more into the breakfast side)
But like with brunch ingredients
Like a breakfast sandwich
you should be...
What's your ideal brunch sandwich?
Brunch should be about choice
I want to be able to eat a burger while my friend eats pancakes
Which is sad
I feel like brunch is more of a breakfast near lunchtimer rather than a combination of the two
Agreement
Ok, so is it just me or like is it acceptable to eat any breakfast food at brunch but not necessarily any lunch food at brunch?
#skillz
Just killed a mosquito with one finger
My signature is just me frantically making scribbly lines in hopes that people think I know what I'm doing
with the exception of the dot on the i
unrelated to nails, i just realized i can sign my name using only alternating up and down strokes at an even pace
I got a door slammed on my nail and had half of it torn off (vertically)
i chipped both ring fingernails today somehow
I saw the 1st message and was like woah we're actually psychically connected
Speaking of nails, I actually have a scar from that one time <@561219716429905920> dug her nails into my arm after I was being a dipshit at a football game
I broke a toenail today
Ripperoni
You otherwise have really nice nails though. Just like actually trim them lmao.
Since I dyed my hair over a mth ago it's grown half an inch
My nails and hair both grow slowly lol
You should trim those though
Oh, that's not as bad as I envisioned
I don't have a ruler sorry
Do you have a picture?
wdym what
Maybe I'm misremembering what a centimeter looks like
Wait what
greatest length to width ratio is the pinky, which is 1.5 x 0.6 cm
You're pretty much asking for chipped nails at this point
Girl, trim your nails
about 3/4 inch
actually the middle finger is longer and it's 1.9 cm
What's that in freedom units?
entire ring fingernail, the longest one, is 1.8 cm
That's actually not that bad wtf
or 0.4 cm
that's the white part
3/16th of an inch
This is the real tea
How long are your nails??
yeah
It's been 6 weeks
How the fuck
W h a t
random observation, i haven't clipped/filed my nails since the week we graduated
I'm pretty happy with both my fingernails and toenails
fingernails are great, why can't there be a balance lol
my toenails are always fucked
Toenail tea
please go see the evolution help desk for more information
i apologize for your frustration
I am upset that we have them
Toenails serve no purpose for the human body
Uh huh
Nothing about this is awkward at all
Wdym
I think you’re confusing awkward tension with sexual tension lol
You are mistaking the illusion of bliss for the real thing
But I still disagree
Also that lighting makes my dress look p gray
Although you're not that awkward. I'm surprised you were the only one in the background since it was prom.
You were clearly looking away, so you wouldn't know. This is photo evidence of how perfect they are for each other. Checkmate, Salina.
Lol the awkward me on the side
See? They just look like they love each other so much.
I beg to differ
....
They're perfect for each other though
Might be worse
That’s not much better than being single
Yikes
You're not single. You have Peter.
Nice
I feel attacked
The dude was my childhood
Yeah
Rijhwani taught me that
That was felix hernandez right
Oh hey
L
It gone now
Big cri
There have been 23 of them in history
Last time a perfect game happened in the MLB was 2012
Wowwww
Damn, I did not see this coming
Make that 8!
Idk if anyone here cares, but Mike Leake's pitching a perfect game in Seattle through 7 so far
You gotta hit them with "chill bro"
That's not the move then
I open discord to find both unread messages start with "bro", I am concerned for our collective sanity
*enter*
"bro chill"
Hope it works out. That's a big of an oof.
yup
yeah I really should shouldn't I
it's probably ok to directly send a message asking them nicely to message less
r i p
don't really wanna say
lmao
Whomst
if you can say that is
who the hell?
if you've noticed me being invisible lately this is probably why lmfao
bc it's kinda freaking me out
what do I do if someone is so clingy that they basically message me every time they see I'm online on any platform
Yeah, I can imagine they're scrambling right now. This tragedy really came out of nowhere.
if anything
I'm holding out for KyoAni's statement
I'm sorry, Alan. I hope you get some closure soon so you can rest easier.
It's only natural to be scared for people you know when something this large and horrific happens
I'm wishing that the staff that worked on my favorite shows are okay, which is a selfish thing to say, but it's what I'm feeling
I definitely understand that. It's a tragedy, but it's still hard to wrap my head around the scale of this. I can only imagine it's harder for you too.
That's not a lot of info then. That's honestly kinda terrifying.
it's hard because you know deep down you shouldn't hope for one person's death over another's
but that's including staff that might not have even been in the building at the time
about 6 or 7 people from KyoAni's staff, mainly directors, have been confirmed safe
Has anyone been able to verify anything?
but it's still very early
rumors are being thrown about on twitter about who's allegedly safe
Oh my gosh
I'm sorry, Alan
the only thing left now is to find out exactly *who* died
still sad about kyoani
Hey, sorry I'm a little late, but is everything alright on y'all's ends at the moment? Just wanna check how you guys are holding up and everything.
oof
my eyes are dying but i still wantn to look at screens
thanks starbot
lol good luck: https://github.com/wenjalan/Starbot
!help
you have to type something
no it's not auromatic
!delete
nah he did it himself
https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/017/225/zAp2LzJ.jpg
lewd
huh maybe
that's why it can be done fast
i think starbot has a function to deleter the previous message?
Lol
FFS
CAN IT STOP RAINING
ohhhhhh
I see you hoe
and then deleted
kinky
https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/017/225/zAp2LzJ.jpg
he typed lewd
Prob
is this an programmed response?
Lolllll
https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/017/225/zAp2LzJ.jpg
lol
LMAO
kinky
kinky
if you ever want me to get the gag out, just say the word
i think my aunt vaguely wished my mom would help my cousin (the one who now has a baby) to get to america, but my mom noped out of that super fast by not responding lol
okay
functioning perfectly
He is working as intended
No
is starbot misbehaving
Lol
lol thanks starbot
thanks starbot
you fuck off
some of them make a lot of jokes about me and helen helping their kids get to america in the future and it makes me hella nervous like do NOT contact me in the future please fuck off thank you
they must know that they're not going to gain any favors by saying those things
“Hahaha even when everyone has left you your family will be there for you”
like what is their motive
lol that makes no sense from a logic pov
One of my least favorite tactics that family in China and my parents like to deploy is the
Ngl
they always pretend to be nice and buddy-buddy bc "we're blood"
anyways my point was they're never direct and that annoys me more than anything else
Fun!
I really strongly dislike the vast majority of my extended family
Ie med bills and funeral costs
as I've said, my mom's older sister is genuinely probably the worst person I've ever met
And both of them get shit on for not paying for everything
There’s like only one other successful sibling on my dads side
my mom's sisters are kind of selfish and careless but they're usually not outright savage
whoa
there's a lot
also shitting on my dad for not wanting to associate w them
Ah fun
also stuff about my mom "abandoning" her mom
rip i'm sorry
also criticism about not being able to speak super fluently
But it’s cheap
but that failed obviously so then a bunch of digs about not going to "the good schools in america" even tho I live here and "have it easier"
Lol rip Canada
they don't say mean things though because they want stuff from us
uh I really wanted my mom to not tell people where I was going for college
lol
a lot of bitterness/jealousy about us being in america
my mom's family likes to think we're a lot better than we are and are jealous probably
what kinds of things do they say?
2) America
but I feel like they kinda demonstrated the worst side of the culture lol
1) I was like 7 and 10 when I went
I got so much shit for not being perfectly fluent
to be fair it might just be my family sucking
China is shady but like not in the fun way
Meanwhile I’m like lowkey trying to avoid forcing Noah to be around my parents lol
Being around Noah’s family is like an atmospheric hug
I got way more backhanded compliments and subtle disses the few times I visited china than literally the rest of my life combined
yeah
the two cultures just have completely different values in that aspect
i mean i live here duh
i get why western people dislike that
Brb dishonoring the family cow
and it's something I personally really dislike lol
I think it also comes with achievement and family pride being v highly valued
yeah
ok but I think there's a level of superficiality in chinese culture that doesn't really exist in the west
Adam Dong’s older sister
SHE DIDNT GET INTO MED SCHOOOOOL
what alice
She was salutatorian in high school
Remember Alice
Yesterday my mom was like
honestly i could see this happening in any culture because it's just a human nature thing
my mom is always telling me (roughly translated bc idk how to pinyin) to hide the ugly or whatever
My parents are still be hella passive aggressive about
That’s a classic parent dick move
“My kid wants to be a doctor and I think they shouldn’t”
don't let people see your problems etc
yeah i can see that
like it's part of the culture
tbh I feel like appearance is p important to most asian families
I mean what else do you say
yw
Thanks Sherlock
appearances are probably pretty important to them then
oof!
Them: act like it was their idea and are so proud of it at Asian parties
Me: plans to do it
That my parents were like you can’t fucking do med
I find it so funny tho
no one ever asks me about my major because it's so generic lol
Me: sigh
“Sooooo you wanna be a doctor”
thanks starbot
So whenever I pop up it’s like
you shut up
Well my parents haven’t shut up about me wanting to do med
that's pretty cool
haha great minds think alike
She’s going to emory for premed I think
But from what I’ve heard she’s also been evading the same parties
I’ve been evading Asian parties like the plague so idk
do you know how christine has been? didn't get a chance to talk to her
Fun
and michelle lin who was another intern last year
and last week i saw sanjana
two days ago i saw sophia hu
also saw Julia on the way back
i was just thinking about her yesterday can't remember why tho
oh also i saw christine on the bus today
Rip
Lol
ok fairly sure she doesn't want to talk to me lol
time to see what happens
just sent a message to a really old friend
speak of the devil
true
emi pops in occasionally
everyone else is dead
lol the four of us seem to take over every tea channel there is
I wouldn't get the memo and just pass out on a couch somewhere lol
We already discussed what I would do if the apocalypse was about to happen
take a commercial flight to space
lol
the international space station
honestly the best place might be to get super rich and go to space to watch it happen
probably not the best place
my answer? in the sky
where will you be when house sized pieces of ground come crashing down from the stratosphere
honestly if i'm within viewing distance of the meteor there's probably zero chance of survival
or maybe not underground, but wherever is safe
i think i would try to see it happen then duck underground as soon as the storm comes close
and something that I'm probably guessing nobody in history has ever seen before
watching how a meteor might smash into the crust of the earth, throwing up huge chunks of ground fast enough to propel some of it out of our atmosphere sounds like a beautiful thing
but seriously
indefinite backpacking trip
like i'd have all my provisions and backup plans prepared before partying or whatever
i will live it up on the last day but only in a safe way so i might be able to survive afterwards
I'll try it
surviving sounds like a fun challenge
but like I think I would be torn between living it up while I still assuredly can, knowing I'm probably dead either way, or taking my chances and trying my best to survive
well yeah
ok..... touche
i like to think of it as, your life up to this point of the apocalypse is like a certain segment of a film reel, the next part of your life could just not exist or you can add a segment, but either way what you have already experienced doesn't change
keep throwing plastic in the ocean
there are no consequences if you're dead
lol first we gotta engineer a way for the world to end
let's do it
sounds like good fun
so................. ???
like I would want to experience it
idk i'd rather fight to survive and then not, than not fight
I would be so curious about how such a thing would play out in real life
BUT AT THE SAME TIME
i don't think you need a meaning in life to try to survive
but if all you do every day is just fight to survive is there a point
ok I feel like a lot of post-apocalyptic stories assume that there's inherent meaning in existing
keep a pistol on me for suicide if it looks like it's gonna hurt
parachute and watch until I hit the ground
and fatal
if you're in the air you will get blown out of it and that could be terrifying
possibility of survival but unlikely and v uncertain
because if there's a possibility of survival i'll take that
I might opt for a helicopter
now that I think about it atop a mountain might be a little shaky to see clearly when the thing actually hits
I'm sure there'd be a giant "yolo" party happening somewhere
when you said apocalypse, did you mean there's a possibility of surviving afterwards or certain death?
third option is to actually keep on dancing til the world ends
or how the sky might turn a scarlet red as the meteor falls closer and closer to earth, eventually plummeting the land into dark night-like atmosphere by blocking out the sun letting only the burning atmosphere light up the world below it
I think my main motivation in that case would be curiosity about what the world might look like after
but is there even a point to living after the apocalypse?
you're in a precarious position on the mountain then
I'm sure my practical senses would be telling me to try to plan for survival
how the ground might shake and be thrown up by a meteor and waves of trees and land move in a tsunami-like formation outwards of the center
it's like the sunset but with much more gusto
dignified
majestic
like on one hand mountain sounds epic
yeah actually i'll choose distance too
in the distance so I can actually see the impact
but I asked because I'm not sure myself
that could be interesting too
distance
would you rather see it fall in the distance or fall on you?
sounds like a good view
I still stick by observing from atop a mountain
i'd rather die in the impact and get to see something most people don't get to see than hide out than die in the toxic atmosphere
lol
oh lol
idk like a meteor or something?
if it's a giant meteor crashing into earth and we were at the center i would totally just stand on open ground and watch it fall
what kind of apocalypse?
this was lowkey inspired by watching old britney music videos lmao
climb a mountain and watch the world end from atop it
Huh
if we somehow knew that the apocalypse was coming what do you think you would do the day before the world ended
ok completely different direction and a kind of random question
that's good, that means they're actually gonna do stuff with their education
For all three of these guys I think it's extreme passion
I'm like this is so stereotypical, but I wish I could understand what they're saying lol
is it extreme passion or extreme pressure from parents
whenever I see these kinds of people I worry about what's motivating them
MIT guy meets Stanford guy and they immediately start geeking out
massive respect
sometimes I think I was pretty proactive in hs and then I look at kids who actually had a vision and made moves to accomplish it at 14-15
meeting people like that always hits me like damn
man
found an organization in your sophomore year of high school that hosts coding competitions around the state
ohhhhhh
Scroll up
well my point still stands
tea?
oh damn
The MIT guy is the one who cheated to get the internship
oh
That's the guy in upenn
No no
> found an organization dedicated to code competitions recognized around the state
so that's the kind of folk that get into MIT
ah
Lol
success
HA
Blame/thank <@503787499605458954> for corrupting my mind
Ok, I'll stop lmao
Maybe he can last that long too
I mean, hey, I dunno
There's a lot of better ways one could spend two weeks rather than ignoring me
I go quiet and in two weeks you’re like this
What happened to you
GENE
Sigh
Wow, if it grows as fast as his class standing too...
By the way he's going to Mit
Gold digger senses lmao
Now he earns twice as much as us to make a website
Pretended to be a college sophomore
But there's this dude same age as us who got in because he does something like running start at UCF
Explore internship is for college freshmen and sophomores
Help, I'm still laughing over here. The joke wasn't even that good.
Ik
I'm kidding lol
Get out
👀
I mean, if his dick is as long as his resumé...
(I was kidding I'm actually just curious)
any other interesting work people?
~~my gold digger senses are tingling get him~~ I mean what
He also got into Caltech which made me mildly jealous for a moment lmao
why am I not surprised
Though apparently it's some super competitive dual CS and Wharton program
Still, damn
<@340319804747415553> Do I have permission to roast Noah on something?
He's upenn
Nah that's the other guy
He's a Stanford lad tho, isn't he?
Wow accomplished folk
Same as us
how old is he?
brooooo
Damn look at this
I found his LinkedIn profile
Exactly
yea can't see shit
I love large group photos where you can see a lot of people but none of their faces
Lol this is the closest thing, he's the second on the top right row
We keep on saying we all want a group photo but it never happened
sad!
I don't have pics
send pics
wait ok
as the girl in detective pikachu
lol sure
so that's like ditto's face
lmao
type rating
a 4/3 is more recognizable as a human than a smiley face
You know it
Oh yeah
lol simplifying fractions here are you
Almost a 1
That's like
Oof, 4/3?
sorry tom holland but this guy is a 16/12
13 is Gene
so like groot? that's offensive to groot
12 is tom holland
1 is barely recognizable as human
idk how to rate someone from 1 - 12

ok <@470822754262712329> that was weird
oh
(what has been discussed before)
I need an adult
The boy is <@470822754262712329>
We've discussed this before, Alan
🤔
scale of 1 to 12
and how much
what kind of cute
the boy
Don't be too hard on yourself
You're doing great
Nah, fam
Oooooo nice! That's cool
if i were a better person i would be using this day to learn more things
to finish the design document for the project
Valid
it's ok that means i have one day to chill
What's it a deadline for?
Ooof rip
i have never had a deadline before today
and today was the one day when i actually had a deadline
i didn't realize this was idiots anonymous
As cute as <@470822754262712329>
i walked to his office at the appointed time and he was talking to someone so i waited in an open meeting space nearby for 20 minutes, then i checked again and he was gone, then i messaged him and he never responded
what kind of cute
these are the important metrics we gotta know
how cute is the boy
Why did your manager ghost you?
i'm bored at work and my manager ghosted me, ama
Let us know if you do then
Alright lmao
Nah that's all the tea lol
Do you wanna talk about it <@472541429130854421>?
That's cursed
OHHH I see it now
talk like a proper human being right now or I will smack you with this here board
Coworker?
talk like a proper human being right now or I will smack you with this here board
Owo
Really?
I wonder which word it was
talk like a proper human being right now or I will smack you with this here board
Ohhhhhh i said coworker
Lol
???
talk like a proper human being right now or I will smack you with this here board
Update: I think cute intern coworker guy likes me
because then I don't know how much to raise or lower the tone of my voice by
it fucks me up whenever I use headphones and talk into a mic though
yea yea I know
it has to do with the fact that there are certain vibrations from your vocal cords that only you can hear when you speak
I think everyone hates the way they sound
I hate the sound of my voice but I feel like a lot of people are like that so idk if it's actually Annoying or if I just have the usual aversion to hearing myself
like I don't really notice changes in my mannerisms until after they happen and then I'm like huh where did that come from
I actually have no idea who I pick things up from but I feel like it happens a lot
I prefer Jasmine but bo lei is still good
the only acceptable dim sum tea
<@!478706068223164416> opinions on bo lei tea
i guess i steal a bit of cindy's
there was a phrase that only evon and i use that i know of but i forgot it
or like
see i pick up things that people say like slang terms
although jane is slowly starting to steal mine
i have my own speaking quirks
i just become a whinier bitch sometimes
not that much of a change
i have ayush, jeesoo, and evon’s speaking quirks
i'll take that i guess
i basically have noah's speaking quirks now
i quite like my voice and my manners
if you guys could trade voices, vocab, and other speaking quirks with someone in this group, who would you trade with?
Also a very good parody song: https://youtu.be/nFbWXuR_2Ow

Oh I see
elementary school music class
Do you just hit them
They play a note
it's the music note tubes we used in like
You whack them
Dafuq are these
redbone boomwhackers cover
sell me the *pitch*
but what's the plan
great
that is
someone wanna make a bad decision with me
That's kinda like me not experiencing the MCU without knowing about iron Man dying
Damn
fuck dude
alcohol poisoning?
Most notably, Michael Jackson
jesus she was 27?
I've definitely had that with a lot of people
and I've never really experienced her music without knowing that she's gone
but I remember the day the news came out that she died
I was like idk how to formulate this in a non-morbid or offensive way
I know
that's such a loaded sentence
lol
I'm sad I don't really remember her being alive
have I ever mentioned that I fucking love amy winehouse
lol
unlike *some* tracks
because jazzy lofi keeps it interesting with the melody
ooh yeah jazzy lofi is my favorite kind
it usually happened while studying or doing homework at like 2-3 am
but I think I've mentioned I need to be in a super specific mood for lofi
I really like spotify's jazz vibes lofi playlist
idk
hifi?
chillhop is lofi without the lo
which may or may not be the same genre depending on who you ask
see also: chillhop
lower energy and lower bpm, associated with relaxation and chill
hip-hop inspired tracks that have been sampled/reworked to create a dustier, more earthy tone to them
generally
there's a lot of kinds and they all sound like lofi but what even is lofi
like. idk how to describe it
what exactly are the genre boundaries of lofi
doc wenton graces another soul with the nourishing waves of lofi
thank you
I've been blessed
holy
WAIT I LOVE THIS
wait I'm intrigued I love that song
https://open.spotify.com/track/7cDlVNC3d0RRW4p2qmiMLm?si=7Ab1Go1PTEC-asiKEtyH7A
have it anyways lol
dammit and I had this lofi cover of redbone queued up
am chillin w some old school soul
You've more than earned it at this point
<@!478706068223164416> I'm good lol but thanks
If you need to sleep, go get some rest
like 9 but I now feel like I'm gonna be awake for at least another hour or two
Idk, but me too
When do you need to be up?
why is 12-1 am my peak social hour
want some lofi?
I keep being super sleepy and then accidentally pushing through it by talking to y'all and now I'm wide awake and this is No Bueno bc I actually have plans tomorrow oof
same idea
well actually it would be sunset then sunrise
sunrise and sunset
Extreme sledding
YES
what if we just did a one night backpacking trip
mood but still
but waking up e a r l y
tbh I'd rather go up in the dark than down
how about that
dangerous would be a sunset hike
a little bit higher than dangerous
lol
true
but also winter hike + darkness is also toeing the line of "stupid dangerous"
they don't make my knees hate myself, weirdly enough
assuming they happen
i love snow hikes
lmk if you guys do a winter hike
we'd have to wait for an actually nice day though
wait ok I actually know the perfect winter hike for this
ez clap
if we go in the winter we could wake up at 8
right now, yeah
Summer gang
doesn't the sun rise at like 5
idc if we have to get up at like 4
I'm so down
we should do one sometime
actual aerobic exercise for two
sunrise hikes for one
there's so much shit I could get done if I only had to sleep for like 4 hours
Thank you
/end
Leave it for another day
Chill
Look, I get the point
we can actually stop talking about it if you want
what you wear says something about you no matter if you like it or not
I express myself too much without those things already
clothes, hair, and fashion in general are the first thing you can use to express yourself without opening your mouth
also looking better leads to feeling better about yourself which leads to more self-confidence. generally.
It's a balance between being physically and socially comfortable
I'll wear what I need to blend in and not stand out in a bad way but still be comfortable
yeah I realize this is prob redundant
first impressions especially are super important
I'm well aware
ok 70% of the time I also don't give a fuck what I look like BUT you should care about looking nice bc people will judge you whether you like it or not
r i p
I have a lot of bitchy people in my life
Nope, still happens
ezpz lemon squeezy
done
oh then just stop wearing skyline stuff
I don't honestly care that much about looking nice
The only reason I'd want to change it is so that people will stop giving me crap for what I wear
it takes a bit to start becoming a little more courageous with your wardrobe
I was like that too
no I totally get it
I'm honestly a liiiiittle bit sensitive about it, so sorry if I'm coming across as a prick, but I'm also just being a dramatic bitch, and I kinda do wanna fix things
But still fuck you
I appreciate it and will take the advice
thank you
But also still fuck you
IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO FASHION I'M GIVING YOU A LEAD
I'll look at it later
Thanks, but also fuck you
shhhh
it's not bc his skin is literally sticky
here's some SUPER basic introduction to not dressing sloppy
Fuck you too, Alan
the crawling on walls thing is bc of this specific electrostatic thing
https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/5da1dc/the_basic_bastard_basic_wardrobe_and_inspiration/
hold on
okay
gene
I'm talking about being sticky
I'm not talking about the web solution
The whole crawling on walls things isn't because of the suit
he designed the web solution it's not an actual power
what do you mean "wait, what"
Wait, what
yeah, because of the damn suit
the medium place
He does stick to shit tho
think like
so making things shitty
we;re talking watered down
shhh
the webs don't come out of him
ok y'all realize that's literally not how he works right
i don't mean it
sorry sorry
tacky hands for a tacky person
It's a slightly worse version of that all the time
Like, you know when you give someone a handshake but your hands are really clammy?
like being able to tell when something's gonna happen a bit before normal
LMAO
You're kinda strong but you're just a generally sticky person
honestly the only thing I care about is the spidey sense
Watered down Spidey powers sounds terrible
just alter bits and pieces of reality
honestly i think i'd love the rumor's powers from umbrella acad
Is it a superpower to not have people roast my fashion?
I think I might go for like watered down mantis or spidey powers
anyways back to the superpower thing
you should get pinterest
on a good day
maybe 3.5
I'm somewhere in 3
I'll live between 2 and 3 and call it a day
I love pinterest
4) has pinterest
3) puts some thought into what they wear
2) not a bedhead
1) bedhead
there's like, four distinct levels of guy fashion
Honestly, there are very few people in my life who I feel obligated to impress with my appearance
fashion is HOT
but the flip side is that girls fuckin notice if you put effort into your appearance man
I wear the high school shirts when I don't have other clean clothes and I'm around people who I don't particularly care if they're impressed with how I look
ok see guys get away with looking like trash WAY more than girls could ever
but still abide by rule 1
a hoodie if you're feeling adventurous
I FEEL ATTACKED
I am of the opinion that if you're socially awkward, it don't matter how attractive you are cuz you just screwed, so why even bother
easy shit to do for fashion guys edition
1) stop wearing high school gear
2) do your hair (bare minimum not a bedhead)
3) a t shirt and well fitting jeans
also, I am of the opinion that as long as you're not like horribly disfigured, anyone can be pretty damn attractive if they actually put in effort i.e. getting in shape and getting clothes that suit them well
Stop roasting me lol
I'll get new clothes by the end of the summer
Hey, we've gone over this
a good fashion sense is makeup for your whole body
honestly
Unless your face is cursed. Idk how to help you there.
But for your whole body
It's like automatic makeup
I can look like a better version of myself
BUT
I can't exactly make myself look like an animal or anything, sure
dude that'd be terrifying
Think about it
No, no
Ok true
oh noooo
Shapeshifting, but your face stays the same like Ditto
you know how much shit I could get done
so that'd also be lit
I basically don't get lonely
<@478706068223164416> that'd get a little lonely
He's super to me
Shhh
power to sleep for half the normal amount of time and still wake up refreshed
he's also a regular dude
not really
Does that count?
I'd have watered down Tony powers.
I'm not smart enough to build a suit with a box of scrapd, but at least I'm not dumb anymore.
the running one is solid but honestly there's v few situations in which I get the opportunity, let alone the need, to go at a dead sprint
hmmm
What kind of watered down power do you want?
I agree there's no downside
we're all baseline humans rn
it's a direct upgrade no matter what
Which one would you want?
Ok, well
Hmm, you have a point
Cuz you'd have to think that for each superhero with an extreme superpower, there's tons more with really mild abilities
what's the downside
yeah of course
But hey, you can hover for a bit if you jump
Or like you can't quite fly
But you can still run p scarily fast
Like, you don't quite have superhuman speed
Would y'all accept a watered down super power?
<@460689096646590465> although I'm not opposed to broadway
<@478706068223164416> awwww thanks
lol my vocal range is nonexistent but it's chill
as long as broadway wasn’t your end goal
having a large vocal range is great, but having a voice that is uniquely your own is vastly more important
so don't worry about it
they just care that it belongs to you
nobody really cares how deep your voice is
Oh lol
What
get a smoking addiction
alternative step 1
stop caring
step 1
Awww thanks. And I appreciate being compared to doggo. It's the highest compliment.
you just don't
insulting/trash talking you is like trying to kick a sad puppy
.... most of the time
you're honestly very wholesome
and i can say that without joking
you still cute
well
rip
I am the antithesis of masculinity in a lot of aspects, and it's mildly amusing
L
Some guys talk lower than me without even trying than me when I try to go as low as possible
i have a p middling voice range but i can actually go p low
good work
It was honestly mildly embarrassing lol
yea
Were you there for this?
damn really?
Ok, tea, but after testing how low I can make my voice at a normal conversal level, I'm actually shook that I can't go lower
They'll roast the hell out of everyone, and it'll be great
Y'all should meet them sometime
aw ok
They left tho
That's the tea
tell courtney that she's literally my role model lol
rip
Scott and Courtney are over visiting at the moment, and it's a bit of a reality check when I realize how much more interesting their lives are than mine lol
I see how it is
wow
even i'm disappointed
cindy you look like you're losing your touch
me: head desk
cindy: walks into fight 10 seconds later
cindy: "i think i'm locked out"
me: has a heart attack thinking we need to reset the whole instance
cindy is bad at fucking walking
lol
I got lost in a game
where are you lol
stairs are confusing
???
and dumb
it's somewhat justifiable but I am sad
guys salina's bullying me
He radiates the need for validation/praise which really doesn’t wear well
yeah he comes across as incredibly insecure
Just to be clear
He’s not desperate just in the relationship way
sorry not really sorry
and it's not just 'cause he seems desperate on my part I've had a LOT of negative experiences with that guy
I just have a really strong distaste/aversion towards him
I'm not even sure I dislike him in the usual sense
I don't hate him, to be clear
Tbh, he's never given off that vibe to me
So its a little strange that he gives off that vibe
Weirdly though I think he's had a girlfriend like 80% of the time that ive known him
i have met plenty of just fine desperate people but like Jeffrey lights up the desperate radar more than Woof's lighthouse
sorry but also not sorry
he's desperate and he doesn't wear it well
well
Geez y'all gonna hate my mans Jeffery because he seems desperate?
Keep us posted if something interesting develops
Lmao I'm glad to hear
I’m actually very very entertained
Lol IM fine
How you holding up?
Oof I'm sorry
Jk jk
Do I need to rethink my relationship choices
Lol I’m at an Asian party w people our age, including ppl who know Gabe and Noah, and they all agree Gabe is more attractive
Interesting ok
Stuck in the weeb life
What's that mean, and is it a bad thing?
jeffery's stuck in otaku zone
He was a little slow to realize me and Makenna weren't exactly friends anymore after we had a falling out, which caught me off guard given that he talked to both of us p and saw us interact pretty regularly at the time, but that wasn't at all his fault, and it was more awkward than "oh, that's a dick move"
i find him alright company; i certainly don't have high expectations for him but that's not necessary to have fun conversations anyway
He hasn't done anything overtly bad to me personally tbh
He comes off as incredibly desperate
Yike
I would rather get my face bitten off by herc than spend a day with Jeffrey
I don’t like him lol
And I have mixed feelings about just about everyone, so idk what this means either
Although take that as you will, as there are very few people I harbor overtly negative feelings towards
I have mixed feelings about him, but they tend to sway slightly positive
he has always been really nice to me
I like jeffrey li
UW does credits weirdly
Idk I have to check lol
how many science classes do you need?
Send help
Psych doesn't give science credit at UW
that's the only thing i would skip bc math classes they offer are actually useful to me
Help
They're making me take more math
they only require two science classes anyway
riiiiip
i can't use my ap creds to skip requirements 😦
lol I'm doing sociology on top of presumed ib credit and if that's still not enough I will do psych
i'm going to use psych to fill all my science reqs hopefully
yeet
fuck lab sciences I'm OUT
SAME
i will never have to take another physics/chem/bio class and i am very happy
Four last names? oh geez
Please
Yes
can we ban math
gouge my eyes out now
David, if you marry someone else with two last names, are you gonna FOIL your names?
and my second last name covers everything else
lmfaooo
blegh
why does that remind me of bts
at least you have a unique last name
The army rises
lol
Why is there so many of us
<@261949028994908170> love you, my dude
Everyone named David is either super nice or a complete jackass, and there's no in between
I think I very vaguely remember him from band
He's really nice too
You're thinking of David Williams
Football
Also, his biceps are three times thicker than mine
is he the baseball guy?
Love that guy
Yeah, I know
(David Voigt)
aw cute
I promised him that we'd play Smash one of these days once exams were over, but we kept doing things in class, so I pulled out my Switch during the graduation assembly and we played a match (with <@261949028994908170> too) together before he had to leave, and it was the perfect wholesome conclusion to high school
hahaha
ABORT
ABORT
OOF
he asked if i'm dating anyone a few days ago
riperoni
I know
jeffrey that is
i think he likes me
b) daniel goddamn song. good riddance I'm so glad I will probably never see him again
lmao
a) jeffrey li (I saw him at dragonfest and literally fucking ran I hope he didn't recognize me. also he added me on snap today and I'm just gonna ignore that)
Autoincorrect 2 me 1
not that i dislike people
Bitch
Birch
You sound like a cold ass birch
Good job Helen
F
He's such a sweet guy, and he honestly just made bio just a little bit brighter every day for me
not to sound like a cold ass bitch but i don't think i'll miss anyone
ok I can immediately list 2 people who i definitively do NOT miss
I don't
Idk if y'all know him, but <@340319804747415553> prolly does
I feel like the answer is yes but lemme think about whomst for a sec
Cuz I really miss David Voigt from my bio class now
We were talking about small talk, and then this came to mind
woah that's a deep question
Do you guys miss anyone from Skyline who you weren't particularly close with yet?
rip
Bye!
ok cya for real
I watched Bohemian Rhapsody with my parents today
i really should sleep
HAVIN A GOOD TIMEEEE
even though it's terrible for me
havin a good time
'cause I'm havin a good time
yeah, i'm probably going to still be up on my phone for a while
stop me now
don't
might as well have a good time
but i also know i won't be able to fall asleep
goodnight guys
yeah i need to sleep too
G'night
i have to go to sleep tonight
It's chaotic neutral, not chaotic stupid
"i do whatever the fuck i want"
"i'm chaotic neutral"
All he's missing is translating this into a functional DnD character
lol you should make wendy alexis come to life one day as like a halloween costume or something
He's really roleplaying
slayyyyyy qweeen
i c o n
we stan
wow alan
oh my god
ALAN WHY
lmao alan
yeah idk how to describe my family dynamics, it's very comfortable most of the time but sounds sad when i try to compare it to like white people family life
noah's family is the sweetest fucking thing
I've commited now
my mom always shits on me for not being "sweet" but I'm like you literally never raised us that way why do you expect us to act that way now
which translates to thanking/expressing my gratitude a ton but being honestly pretty cold compared to what a lot of families are like
I am genuinely super grateful to my parents for a lot but I'm also highkey super bitter about a lot so it's weird
force of habit
i say love you very superficially to my parents
r i p
they never say it either
oh damn
i don't think i've ever said "thank you" to my parents
once you establish a certain habit with someone it's hard to change
which is kinda wack
idk if I've ever said I love you to my *parents*
lmao
like I think it freaks my parents out when I'm super huggy in front of them bc I'm never like that with them
don't feel bad, i'm the one who has still never said 'i love you' to someone
Oh, yeah, my ideal type is someone shyer than me. That's not really saying much, but that's kinda not the point. If you're more outgoing than me, I get drained cuz I'm already p high energy as is.
sometimes I feel bad for being loving w friends and basically Not with family
we'll see
i hope it will change in the future cuz i'd like to be a normal person but
i like my personal space but when i want hugs *i want hugs*
rip
elaboration: lack of physical affection early in life --> uncomfortable with physical affection now
rip
I used to be scared of physical affection and would jokingly scream when people hugged me, and in middle school, people were like, "ok, don't hug Gene," and then I realized, "wait, shit, come back, I'm sorry"
i keep thinking it's better to be surrounded by people better than me but irl i shy away and stick to talking to people i'm already comfortable with or who seem shyer than me
<@!472541429130854421> elaborate?
In terms of like morality that is
opposite for me
honestly I suspect that lack of love when I was younger is a big part of why I am now v tactile/physically affectionate w friends
I am made uncomfortable by people who are better people than me cuz it makes me start questioning shit again
the hug economy had a recession and i want my money's worth
i have a hug debt to make up for the scarcity i had in my smol child years
give decent hugs
have the ability to problem solve
be a decent human being
I might need some ideas if you want me to share more
i have a low bar
go for it
should i answer
oh
idk do you feel like sharing more
Did you get a sufficient answer or do you need more?
and then asked everyone today I guess
I asked what gene's ideal relationship would be like yesterday
relationships and stuff, then the convo derailed in our usual fashion
ah
Like, relationship types
relationship partners
ideal types of... what
idk we were talking about ideal types
I also don't think you knew alex super well back then
i didn't know gene as well in tenth grade
happening
what is
so has gene imo
alex has changed a decent amount in the past two years
i don't think so anymore
did i?
Helen tried to convince me in sophomore year that I was really similar to Alex Park, but I could not see it once I met him
but i can see why they thought it
but I feel like we've diverged a little bit since that observation was made
i've been told that my personality is similar to Angela Sun
Or do you know someone who's similar to someone else here?
that's an interesting question to think about
Have y'all ever met someone with a similar personality?
tbh I think I'd like them a lot
I wonder a lot whether I'd hate or love someone w a v similar personality to me
...
though she would be a good smash partner
my ideal type is the ideal version of my personality
I would befriend myself, not date myself
it'd be short and explosive
lol
tbh I probably would date myself
I wouldn't date myself because we'd have all the same issues
I said this before
oh no it's becoming another gene and gene 2 situation
Alan's ideal relationship is with himself
my mom kind of believes in blood type personalities things, but her theories are very different from the japanese ones
At least we now know
🤦
Oh God
let's go with sure
dear lord are you roleplaying
it's the only APA approved bloodtype
both Alan and I are A+
same lol
A+
do any of you know your blood type?
This is more important than it should be, but I still feel like there's validity here
Oh, also, in an ideal relationship, if I'm driving, the other person knows to put on music cuz they're aware I want music but am an indecisive fuck and need to focus on driving
i'm giving up getting my license for a long time lol
"come on, there's a space right there. theeeere you go. that wasn't that hard now was it"
Like, even when I'm not mad
i can see that too
When I drive, everyone is named "bitch"
"no that's okay I wanted to wait behind the red light anyways"
Owen Wilson saying, "Wow" voice
same i can hear them in your voice now
what voice
I read that in a very specific voice
"waaoooooooooooooooooow"
"turn faster idiot I got places to be"
"yeah that's fine I needed to check my fucking brakes anyways guy"
Valid
i remember
lol
lol
ALAN ALSO TRUE
comfortable silence in which both parties are not doing other tasks and are just relaxing--this happens with my dad a lot but never ever with my mom
you've all probably heard it at one point
so take and give
It's great, cuz I feel like I'm alone but not alone at the same time, so I'm not lonely nor am I anxious
that comfortable  silence is often broken however by me telling off other drivers
Actually, I've experienced comfortable silence when my parents drive
^^ to what alan said
I'm never 100% comfortable
when I'm driving comfortable silence is pretty common
Even tho people explicitly tell me I talk too much
The thing is that I usually perpetuate conversation, so I always feel like I'm expected to talk
but i have a good number of actual comfortable silences too
comfortable silence usually happens to me when both of us are just on our phones and not paying attention to each other which is kinda sad lol
awkward silences are created exactly four seconds after the last person stops talking
I feel like silences are only awkward if you make them awkward
but yeah continuing the discussion
i'm pretty excited for the next six months
damn
really?
Maybe it's just not for me tho
I genuinely want comfortable silence, cuz I love that in theory, but I've never actually experienced true comfortable silence in practice
I feel like a lot of shit happened in six months, and a lot more is going to happen in the following ones as well
lol
happy new halfyear!
aw
happy second half of 2019
whoaaaa
happy new month
Yay
June is over
i would want someone who is not necessarily very extraverted but is more confident in talking than i am
I don't want them to be super extraverted like how I present myself, cuz I'm not a pure extravert despite how I act, and I could not live with putting out that personality for too long
both
Idk, I guess either works
Cuz narrowing that down makes this easier
Are we describing a type or aspects of a relationship?
Man that was really an awful coin flip to land on the XY
?
Yeah, actually, Helen, that's an important clarification
LOL that was me
is this basically the "jiayi but a girl" thing again
The only person with a set plan was whoever had a private room
They better fucking enjoy at least some of my memes
Ideal relationship is harder to describe than ideal type
I want them to be like my best friend
None of the guys have a set plan for the college issue
Unless you want me to throw out vaguely positive words
I honestly don't know how to describe relationships
Oh
what y'alls ideal relationships would be like
Which question?
Example?
well I did ask
If you ask someone enough pressuring questions maybe you'll get some tea
Sure
Ok, steep
Like, we brought in Jarrett and extracted the shoulder fetish tea
steep them you mean
Or do we need to bring in another person to extract fresh tea from them
What sort of tea
Like, at all?
Does anyone in this group have any tea left to spill?
both of them are big on Commitment
it was a heavy question
Fair
Which, tbh, was kinda yikes question to ask
ok but we all been knew
Y'all asked Salina the marriage question
some of them got deep and some were fun but no particular Tea
We just didn't know who
There was a collective urge to throw someone into the fire
honestly kinda true
nothing happened we had very noncreative questions
lol
oh
Ooooof
Wow your memories collectively suck lmao
Lmao you asked me "fuck, marry, kill, out of the people here"
I don't even remember what that was for
But I don't wanna relive that moment, because I'm p sure I visibly died inside
rip
I was the only person to use my one pass. That's tea I guess.
😢
me neither tbh
I don't even remember what the hottest tea from last night was
<@!460689096646590465> if you haven't seen it yet check <#503789276312502276> to verify your claims from last night
You gotta give me a summary of the hottest hot seats
Depending on who was being asked lol
It was fun and not fun
2
Lol that sounds like it was fun
Does hugable have one or two gs?
huggable
Wait
which is basically 30 sec lightning rounds of each person getting asked any question the others can come up with
<@503787499605458954> huggable or open to hugs? Cuz those are different
:3
What is hot seat
yesterday we played hot seat at the bonfire
Is this a continuation of a previous conversation?
she's cute
sweet, empathetic, huggable, smart
But point still stands
I'm kidding
damn
I hate myself. Why would I want that?
No
Which
Someone who's basically me
what did alan say
The first thing I will say that it's most certainly not what Alan said
sure everyone here answer
I'm thinking lol
Is this a lightning round now
I asked it
Was I asked this?
did you ever answer the question about what your ideal relationship would be like
I need to either get in a relationship by 28 or I'll have to go off the grid so Jiayi can't find me
lol
Jiayi and I have an agreement that I did not agree to that he will buy and ship me a body pillow if I'm still single at 30
<@!472541429130854421> I'm down if you're down
the party don't start till I walk in
well hello I got summoned by alan to a different channel but I read this first bc it was intriguing
<@472541429130854421> that implies that you should wing the first two pacts and only actually take the third one seriously
Three times the charm
The most I can offer you is that you can sleep on the couch if Jiayi rejects you at 35 and you need somewhere to cry for the night
Where's the backup backup pact
a *backup* pact
if that's not desperate i don't know what is
Never mind. I all of a sudden have standards.
damn
If jiayi is taken
35
Me
You
Gene
jk jk
Rip
that explains my relationship then
huh
Standards are a myth
NOPE, BEGGARS CAN'T BE CHOOSERS
but you can also choose your standards
***BEGGARS CAN'T BE CHOOSERS***
*ahem*
But as I always say
Interesting
I wanna say 26-29 is the sweet spot
Granted you've been dating for a little bit
Late 20s/early 30s
Mathematically quantify the optimal age for marriage
Graph desperateness over time
We need to collect this data
That's the real tea
So, how desperate are the exceptions?
basically zoo animals
my policy with kids is
Also, good catch. The "almost" is key.
I definitely want to have a kid in the future
<@340319804747415553> I like kids too for similar reasons. But those reasons are also the same reasons I don't feel equipped to be responsible for one.
*almost*
Lmao
To quote my mom "almost everybody who's not married at my age either is crazy or is a loser"
they're delightful in a bad entertainment kind of way
True it gets harder to find good single people
i... actually like kids
Whomst the fuck needs them shrimp tho?
And at that point most sane people are taken
You can adopt at any time
Like if you meet them at 40 you aint having kids or anything
Oh noooo
***ha***
Granted you havent met them yet
ha
ha
....
35 is like right around where marriage doesn't work too well
Ya see, I told myself that, but then I went to UW A&O
I could see myself finding someone in college who I could stick with for life, in that case I'd get married early maybr
rip
<@472541429130854421> in theory, but not in practice. That's where we all are I suppose lmao
why 35
so jarrett
<@340319804747415553> valid
oh boi
I like the idea of a relationship but I have yet to determine if I like them irl
Iconic
We've talked about it
Lmao
but i could see myself being married by 25-26
I like relationships too. I just don't have them.
Oh no no no
i mean maybe it'll be noah, maybe it won't be
sorrrrrry
i just like relationships
and i can accept that lol
Tea
i feel like i might be one of the first folks married here
So I have no need for that
I've accepted that I might actually just go through my entire life single
lol
I would totally best friend marry someone by 35 if I don't find a romantic relationship that lasts
Although Jarrett already has a body pillow, so maybe he doesn't need the marriage pact
Desperation
You'd still be aware if you're coerced
coercion
How can they have a pact if one person is unaware lmao
Cuz the way <@173668455856340994> brought it up yesterday seemed like a very on the spot decision
consent is sexy
LMAO
The thing is, idk if he's informed <@233062637922025472>
Yeah lol
lmao
But 35 is kind of a low number
Which I found to be a little early for a marriage pact, but I suppose it means they're destined for one another
Seriously? 
That's cute
Jarrett already revealed that he and Jiayi have a marriage pact for when they turn 35
Average now is like 28+
Same I'm probably not gonna marry by 27
*dabs*
Emphasis on the word ``some``
Whoa it's weird to think that some of us will be married within ten years
I'll play get Doc Wenton's greatest hits playing at <@478706068223164416>'s wedding somewhere around 10 years from now
oh god
Hey, I'll even do a live performance for you if you ask nicely
:/
John Cage 4'33"
Lmao
you're more than welcome
in that case
hey hey
there's no time like pizza time
If anyone here ever gets married, don't invite me cuz I'll try to get some shitty meme music played
Pizza Time song
F
sorry sorry lol
before he cheats
nothing breaks like a heart
Idk actually
Or like
Another One Bites the Dust
Like
Songs that don't fit the context but are weird in the context when you think about it
she just got back from a friend's wedding
want me to ask susan?
or take on me
So maybe I should request Africa by Toto and see what happens
I'm not actually sure when the song would be played
aw cute
or during the ceremony?
like during a dance?
I've heard of people playing Disney princess songs
Depends on if they have a wedding theme
People generally play cheesy romantic songs I guess
I've only been to one too
What kind of stuff gets played at weddings? I've only ever been to one, and apparently that wasn't like other weddings?
And my parents are very insistent that I fill in the optional song request
And like, these are my brother's friends
So I'm being roped into another wedding, and apparently I'm being asked to suggest a song for them to play at the wedding
Nice to see you got into journalism <@193229269076279298>
This is relevant
<@193229269076279298> https://mynorthwest.com/1431171/good-bad-sammamish/
that might be the earliest I've heard yet
damn
September, I move in on August 10th
That sounds like a September problem
Well a lot of colleges will have snap groups
"I need to network with people. Ah yes, let's use Snapchat."
Recently got back into it bc "networking"
i just don't care for it
idk why
i just don't use snap
rip
But like it can be fun every now and then
Those are my main beefs w sc
And my old camera was p shitty
Also the app takes up a lot of space
I'm awful at streaks and think people care way too much about em
this definitely qualifies as tea
95% of everyone I talk to on snap currently are not close friends
Get snap so I can actually talk to friends on it
I probably should, but I'm lazy and have little motivation to
You should get snap
*laughs in never had snapchat to begin with*
Who do I not have added
I'm back on snap after like a full year
<@478706068223164416> that's usually the move for me too tbh
Ok, well, it may not feel wholesome to you cuz it's normal for you, but it's wholesome to a lot of other people
that's not that bad
i've said "that looks amazing" in response to a photo of a person *cringe*
lol
I have said "nice camera"
that's the sad reality of guys
sends mixed signals
"nice...background"
if I just say "you look nice"
"nice coat"
"nice shirt"
"nice hairdo"
I try to find something specific to compliment
for the most part
i treat my female friends the same as i treat male friends
it's the opposite for me
and that's that on that
but this includes the "yass bitch" @ good pics
I tone down the physical affection a bit bc I try not to send mixed signals lol and also it makes guys uncomfortable bc they're not used to it (which is also sad but whatever)
I treat my male friends basically the same as I do my female ones
here's the tea
<@!258094439636008971> I don't think I'm being especially wholesome by complimenting your appearance
trader joes has great teas
fance
litty thank you
My family's expensive tea comes from our trips to Asia to buy it from tea shops in person, or from relatives who do so
The expensive stuff you don't really buy in America
If you want some loose leaf authentic stuff, take a look at Asian grocery stores, they have entire sections devoted to tea
If you're not looking for the extremely good stuff, just starting out with some bagged tea from QFC works just fine
loose leaf or bags
<@!478706068223164416> where do you buy good tea that's not also really fuckin expensive
This hurts my brain
Whoa what
insert christmas in july cri here
And I'll inevitably not care about it once it's actually winter
Some Christmas sounds nice right about now
I don't mind that we're halfway done tho
2019's been interesting
*woo*?
Lmao
wait no a little less than half I can't math
more than half
2019 is half over
holy shit guys
Cursed image
lmao
Oh God now I can't unsee the comparison
which is funny because this photo came from his grad party
nate?
too hot for gene to handle
Oh dear god
the folds in it gave me some cool lines to play with
your shirt honestly warped p cool
really brings out the definition in my face
I dig the black hole color
much better
there
Vaguely resembles an inkling
i t r i e d
Ice cream head
good effort/10
._.
why is the blending so atrocious
i don't use sketchbook
this is why
abel's head edited to resemble mine more closely and robin's body
Which feh character is that
Lmaoooo
there we go
Look at the picture
Cats don't like a lot of people
Forgot about this but apparently cats don't like me
eh
why couldn't I have used a picture where my hair is actually done
now that I think about it
I love the ocean
Or Minecraft lava
That reminds me of cheetos
Hot
oh god I set my hair on fire
true gene
too good to be true
The black hair looks fake tbh
let's make alan the bubblegum kpop princess he was always meant to be
ms paint here we go
soooo
i can't get the other laptop so i can't deal with it in sai
me and my unkept boring black hair
They're cloning very fast nowadays
Shit man there are 8
can you send the stock selfie
alan
i wanna take a crack at this
let me get the other laptop
wait wait
You mean 8th?
The 6th member of BTS
*boosted*
Yes
Just put a pink blob of color where your hair is
brightness boosted
Firetruck
pink is hard because my hair is black
Using a retainer for the first time in several days since surgery feels weird
with like the blondey roots
go that soft cotton candy pink
Like unironically
The pink might be a good look on him
im the joker baby
Neon green
The glasses look more fake than the hair
lmfao
photoshop
Try bright pink
What kind of app are you using
what other colors can we try
You look like a real college student
Honestly looks pretty good
let's turn it up a little
hm
Nah, it's still quite a commitment
Since you keep your hair short it's easy to switch back to black if you decide you don't like it
You should try it sometime
Gonna be honest, I've wondered how I'd look if I dyed my hair (an unnatural color) for a while now lol
gimme a sec
I wonder how I would look with bleached hair now
For some reason it looks better on my camera than in person lmao
though I can't say what badly bleached hair looks like
Lmaoooo I wore it to bleach the hair if that says anything about how I feel
looks fine to me
some of us aren't pyros
bc
(I'd have to see more of your face to understand more of how the current shade suits you, but I honestly think it's actually p neat)
Why haven't you burned it yet?
The fucking PLMS PE shirt
You know what does look bad?
I don't think it looks bad at all
I kinda like it, but I can also see why you and/or your mom might not
Gotta admit though, it is really interesting as is
The only problem is the lighter roots
If you want a more traditional bleached look, I think it could get fixed with some more bleach and some trimming of the ends, but I'm not the expert.
I still want to do something with it though
Actually I kinda like it more now
may the hair odds be ever in your favor
good luck
sorry rip
and... that's kinda why you don't bleach at home
It looks more even now that it's dry but the roots are still atrocious
The box I picked up wasn't strong enough either
Yep I bleached all of it
Did you get the whole thing bleached?
Awww, I'm sorry you're not happy with it, Helen
The tea: just bleached my hair, it's not terrible but not great, my mom doesn't want me to bleach it again so I'm going to some place to get it fixed asap, hopefully without having to lose hair because it took three goddamn years to grow
Before even owning it myself
lol
I told Matheny in person that I respect her taste in games
So I've been told
blythe plays a lot of it
rip
I've been playing Stardew Valley almost non-stop since buying it after the surgery. I love this game because it simulates having friends, a fulfilling life, and a sense of control without requiring any of the necessary social skills. No wonder this game is so popular.
But again, mixed feelings
Also, Yelp just has a really nice UI
I've never bothered to use Google Maps for reviews. Ever since I saw people reviewing PLMS and Skyline on Google Maps, I've just never exactly trusted it
anyways tbh I usually just browse google maps, where for some reason people seem much nicer/more reasonable, and it hasn't steered me wrong yet
Do they not? I've always just had the app
they make you download the app, which is super annoying
also, they don't let you use the website on mobile
There's a sense of entitlement attached to Yelp that I strongly dislike
People are really fucking bitchy
I don't find it super useful, and everyone is so bitchy??
(I have mixed feelings about it cuz it's useful but also kinda problematic)
How so?
potentially unpopular opinion from a young foodie: I kinda hate yelp
I thought so, but the website doesn't say anything so I can't tell
I thought it was just to graduation??
Wait, really??
School ppl made it clear we can't bring phones to grad party, so this has to be a joke
Cuz honestly who just sits there with a phone unless they really don't enjoy the party (which if they really don't, they deserve to be on their phones cuz it's their graduation too)
Like, I'm 90% sure it is, but people are taking this seriously, and I'm second-guessing myself
And it's honestly kinda rude to ask
I thought it was, but like people are taking it seriously
Cuz people are commenting like it is
damn I can't tell either
Like I actually don't know
Is this satire?
Important Paananen tea for the future: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDRUGkXMB40
wholesome
aw
I started editing their history papers and they're all just praising me lol
Guys help I'm starting to get worshipped by freshmen again lmao
Sorry <@193229269076279298> I didn't realize this was happening
I just finished
I've been working since 4:30 and have not been checking my phone at all
So uh
shhhhh this is soft and pure
i didn't think you'd cheat on me this early
damn
It's a date
So I'll come pick you up at 7:00
Time I wanted to spend doing other things, but yes, I suppose so
so you do have time 👀
The one time you say that, I'm not buried under homework lmao
trust me you have an hour you don't need today
there is no better time than the present to start going to the gym
Again, I'll consider it. I should prolly look into it for the summer. Idk yet.
actually @everyone if you want to go to the gym hit me up
<@!258094439636008971> I'll drag you to the gym if you want
In a lot of aspects of my life
Which I really need to
Honestly, I might consider it if I can get off of my lazy ass
^^
that's what the summer is for!
come hiking w me
eat better
go for runs
get a gym membership
Freshman Gene: PE I for chumps. Ima take dip. Who needs exercise?
Senior Gene: I have a dad bod at 18 and my body hurts every day when I wake up.
Hm, alright lmao
i don't know, you'll have to ask him
i think it's leaf green
Which Pokemon game is this?
I guess I'm Noah now
Shit, I thought this was a dm
what?
he caught a shiny caterpie
<@!193229269076279298> cole started a pokemon game where i'm the main character and you're the rival
and combines 2 of my favorite things so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUaZ5IGL3AY
but this is super cool
random
fine
100% of the money is going towards giving dog and other doggos chew toys
dogs care about money when you don't have enough to feed them
Dog just wants to greet people and make them smile even if they don't have money ELITIST
Dog doesn't care about money
it won't be an issue cuz there will always be people to see him
i mean
damnit gene this is why i gave him to Dumbledore!
you make people PAY to see him???
how dare you ISOLATE him like this
wouldnt you?
everyone would pay to see dog
duh
i mean
you could make more money than Endgame
i think that's movie material right there
5 stars
......truly riveting
no one dies so everyone can give dog head scritches for as long as he wants
you write him an intriguing story then
booooo screw you
i killed him off so idk
cuz dog deserves all the love
do you not love dog?
i mean
i didn't figuure that out
oh really
i love dog
yes
dog
yes and pupper has a _name_
dog is a pupper
his name is DOG
cuz pupper knows what's in style
but only one at a time
true
deserves all the flippers
only one
*flipper
10/10 would give up flippers for
BESTEST SOULMATE
BEST SOULMATE
the good place knows what's up
this is relevant
also
Always sign your human up for potentially fatal tournaments
see you're chillin in wizard heaven/the squid's digestive tract and Dog finally got his heart's desire while learning an important lesson
and now he's in coolest dog in town
and now he finally gets your flipper
singular flippers are totally in
no wonder everyone loved me
let's go with that
....sure
was i just always wearing a singular flipper?
Dog's heart always lusted after your flipper
you lost me
thus
killing him off emotionally, leaving him only with a chew toy for comfort
dog's heart was broken
which means
i lost dog
and therefore
dog lost me
ok but like
geez keep up Gene
bring back dog, and you'll have my interest again
to the giant squid remember
no we lost you BEFORE dog died
idk
so
you lost me after you killed off dog
i mean
yea idk what i'm doign anymore
but ok
that's not what i had in mind
Neville Sr. and Noah ask Dumbledore help them to conceive a child, in which case Dumbledore enlists Salina to create a plant in which a wizard child can be gestated
Salina grows the plant, and therefore Frank (?) Longbottom in her basement
the child is born healthy, but Salina is struck with jealousy and hides the child away in a tall tower that cannot be reached except when the hapless child throws a house elf out the window, which she knows would infuriate Noah and thus Frank is secluded until Alice Longbottom climbs the tower and rescues him
lmao
dumbledore
who's gonna be the surrogate mother
father of Neville Jr's father
let's say this is Neville Longbottom Sr.
yeah
neville was after arthur was born
a very weird time loop
there's like
i only pay attention when dog and i are involved
well
Noah runs off with Neville Longbottom but Salina creates a potion that aids in the birth of Arthur Weasley
there are a lot of plot holes lmao
and you used it solely to cover up a plot hole, you monster
but that death is tragic and painful
he lived to an old age
why would you do this tho
I like how you're more upset about Dog's death than your own
***N O O O O O O O O O O***
at his time of death? 3 months old
He was given an anti-aging potion that had been on the shelf a bit too long and caused him to revert back to his pupper form. Dumbledore was creating the potion to bring him back to his 20 year old self. Unfortunately, at that time, Fawkes was feeling poorly and Dog went to make sure he was ok. Fawkes then burst into flame and Dog was caught in the blast
how old was dog?
wait WHAT
Dog will die before he does
he kinda dies
splendid
shimmering
shining
Dumbledore can show him the world
dog deserves the world
dog deserves more
that will numb the pain
he got a new chew toy
but  d o g
Jane's a dementor, she doesn't care
also, wouldnt kill me make dog sad
but how would you know that before killing me
Dumbledore will take good care of Dog
dog
but
that's it
1. because you're a hufflepuff
2.
how exactly would you know that and why would you want to kill me
what
what
that
She purposefully encouraged the squid to chase her, knowing that Gene would sacrifice himself in order to save her, thus killing him
`incited the giant squid`
why would you be sent to azkaban for something that you didnt intentionally do
is now
i dont think that's how that works
how
why would
wait what
<@!193229269076279298> i don't know that Cindy so that's kind of lost on me
Dumbledore eventually found out the secret when speaking with the Giant Squid and Jane was sent to Azkaban, where she threw off her human skin and joined her dementor kin
<@!520095106888630348> i might be dead, but dog will listen to you talk
initial reaction: wow, that's a high compliment
after the correction: oh shit, damn. that's... oof
This secret died with Gene, as Jane did nothing but mutter unintelligibly to herself and no one really listened to her talk anyway
...the other Cindy
<@!520095106888630348> if you keep this up you're gonna give Cindy a run for her money in terms of writing
She was also chosen to join the Triwizard Tournament and incited the Giant Squid to chase her, which then caused Gene to sacrifice himself to the Squid
Jane was a slightly shady, mostly quiet Ravenclaw whose habits included standing in a corner and muttering to herself darkly
oh shoot
have you done yourself yet?
who's my next ~~victim~~ subject
*konky
kinky
forced him into bed rest huh
.... yikes
he was near death but refused to capitulate until Neville hit him in the back of the head with a "petrificus totalus" and forced him into bed rest until he recovered
it was during his bed rest that Noah finally successfully captured someone's attention and as a result did not get much rest in bed
Noah would eventually learn to love himself and campaigned for elf rights and went on a hunger strike
unless you want me to punt you out a window
you do lol
lmao i need to stop
he liked it when i ignored him
trust me
but is noah a top tho...
although it makes sense why he chose neville longBOTTOM instead
sadly pathetic
that's like
damn
Noah was a Slytherin who was constantly trying to gain the attention of other people and trying to upstage his rival, Lucius Malfoy
He would flex and pose in order to gain Gene's attention but Gene was always talking to Dog and ignored him
(0))
(
(0))
lmao
GENE
ambitious, flexible with rules, general amounts of charisma
jkjk
he can slytherin into these pants any time he likes if i'm his love interest
she gets it
i mean
^
i would say slytherin
good question
a Gryffindor?
what's Noah
i love dog
awwww
he was given your flipper as a chew toy
Dog was obviously taken care of by Dumbledore
They're BFFs remember
feels unrealistic
something about this
unaware of noah's feelings towards me
i was just
explain yourself bitch
<@!193229269076279298>
so
w h a t
...
Noah was in love with you before he gave up and seduced Neville Longbottom
secondly: what do noah have anything to do with that
first and foremost: who took care of dog after i died?
i have many questions
but like
the dog's name was indeed dog
damn
...
The dog's name was Dog
Gene made everyone friendship bracelets and had a pet dog that followed him around, which was a break from tradition but the dog was bffs with Dumbledore so everyone went with it
Gene was a kindhearted soul who charmed all the lady friends (and even people who were not friends @ Noah) but would not know romance if it smacked him in the face
the prequel of harry potter
why are we like
the result of this is that children of these unions will have a fascination with Muggle products
one Mr. Arthur Weasley was born from these unions
well at least i'm rich right
why is it always coming back to this
oh god
Salina will use her herbology knowledge to create a new love potion and amasses a fortune for herself, but the one failure is that the people who take the potion will have the urge to buy laptops for the objects of their infatuation, but do not know what laptops are because they're wizards and don't live in the modern world
#teamplant
feeding the plants
i'm contributing to the environment
aw yiss
one that doesn't involve my love life being turned into wizard stonewall
you will pass through the Squid's digestive system and be excreted onto the sea floor, and the merpeople will use you to fertilize the seaweed lawns
can i have another storyline
again
_bring on the next tragic storyline_
me
haha alright who's next
this au makes me exceedingly uncomfortable
....
to make this more authentic, ya gotta go back and make it so that all of your messages have the little "edited" tag
i see you and your puns
*budding* romance huh jane
damnit noah
i don't like where this is going!
You will then feed them to a venomous tentacula
WHAT
.... wtf
you will have a budding romance with Neville Longbottom until year 6 where a Mr. Noah Righi seduces Neville and they run away together to campaign for gay rights in the wizarding community
can i at least be good at something interesting lol
blah
will be a herbology prodigy like one Neville Longbottom
i can see it
what were you saying about me jane
honestly
so tragic tho
lol or that
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING IN YOUR GENES
with a flipper
he was swimming in the lake
GENE
should i be CONCERNED
yes
single... flipper?
Salina, on the other hand
......
I predict he will be eaten by the Giant Squid in the Black Lake, after which Dumbledore will speak to it and convince it to throw up the remains, of which will include a switch controller, his pineapple stuffed animal and a single flipper from his tragic last expedition into the lake
jumpluff!
so that me now
also, to this day, i can't think of hufflepuff without thinking of this fella:
simultaneously thrilling, comedic relief, tragic, and all in an awesome fictional world
*memorable*
like
at least my death will be
im down
honestly
we know where to look first
if gene ends up in a ditch
Cedric Diggory 2
WHY
J A N E
JANE
JANE
GEEZ
Gene would get picked by the Goblet of Fire and die a tragic death
accept it
yes you a pufflefluff
i've been told i'm a hufflepuff
i used to like lol yeah ravenclaw but now i'm like hi i'm the puddle on the floor of the great hall
tbh i don't really know what house i am anymore
yeah that doesn't surprise me
i hypothesize that Gene would be a hufflepuff
</3
Then who’s gonna finance my next laptop
Not Noah :(
Nooo
no, it's multi-track drifting
Answer to Trolley problem: always chose to kill noah
haven't seen/read Star Wars or the hobbit
jk
trolley problem?
i only know Hogwarts
should we do one?
i just opened the pinned messages and saw gene's last hypothetical
10/10 would join that cult
john oliver is basically my religion at this point
I love John Oliver
but yeah
idr!
they ***bought the vest from LES MIS?!***
good stuff
but yeah
I've seen that one
OH
more recently there was the japanese otter mascot prank too
oh wait
*jane i'm still so disappointed in you*
he keeps buying urls/web domains for jokes
there's so much more comedy gold tho
and then he failed so he bought/got the jockstrap back
http://fortune.com/2018/07/13/blockbuster-video-oregon-john-oliver/
https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/video/john-oliver-purchased-russell-crowes-jockstrap-alaskas-remaining-blockbuster-video-last-week-tonight-1102952
WHAT IS THIS?
JANE YOU'RE A FAKE FAN
OH NO
WHAT
NO?!
there were like 2 diff episodes
WAIT you didn't keep up with this?!?
when was this???
wait WHAT?
Mike Pence wrote a book about his bunny
and then John Oliver wrote another book about Marlon Bundo falling in love with a male bunny bc Pence is homophobic
nothing quite like buying a large leather thong from that one random movie
also trying to save the last blockbuster was hilarious too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs2RlZQVXBU
oh yeah his rabbit lol
mike pence has a pet rabbit
can i get a link?
MARLON BUNDO
excuse me, but i have not heard of what i can only assume to be a comedic gold mine
like the gay rabbit children's book
the pranks he pulls are also fucking gold
i agree
JOHN OLIVER IS SO GOOD
"safety glasses on"
lmao
keep watching until like 11:30
granted, the guy is a dick, but like, he's damn good at what he does lol
Bill Nye dropping the F bomb is so funny
sarcastic bill nye is not something i ever knew that i needed
https://youtu.be/JDcro7dPqpA?t=616

we just deleted the mock trial
k
pretty sure
i think it has been
wait has a snowden mock trial already been done
I agree
awesome
the putin one seems fine
can we stop discussing noah's dick for a sec
good/bad
?
because apparently I'm biased
(humor) resolved, vladimir putin is the real president of the US
ytho
<@!340319804747415553> can you confirm or deny
it's not like super strict
that's the theme
are we doing poli misconduct specifically
it doesn't Have to be humor but like
Resolved, Noah has a smaller dick than Emily
I am still looking for A Debate
can I sign up to main pro
(serious) <@193229269076279298> specifically does not deserve rights
resolved, noah should never be a DoD lol
god throwback to `can women reason`
🖕
(serious) women don't deserve rights
Idk the JFK conspiracy theories well enough tho
within acceptable parameters??
Might be able to work
Less bad

(humor) resolved, jfk faked his death
L
I am already screaming
are you still looking for a humor debate
scream
I'mg onna
It's cool. Good on you for asking tho
sigh alright thanks all
I would say replace it
so replace it?
damn ok
Let's not try to get JSA canceled
I like it a lot but idk how well it would go over
i'm not the best metric
tbh i don't mind it but also
should I replace that resolution
I need an answer
ok accepted but like
sorry
i am
would that be a bad idea
but anyways
/end rant
NO ONE IS HELPING
I'M DYING
FOR OUR CHAPTER CON
no I'M TRYING TO PLAN
Are we just making offensive debate ideas?
how potentially offensive is a humor debate about whether Bush did 9/11
@here
??????????
?????
**:bar_chart: ?**
❤️
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
It autocorrected "how" into "hoe"
Also, Cindy let me borrow her phone the other day
gotcha
Except no asterisk
*/poll and then question in quotes
idk how to make a poll
jeesoo, katya, and sasha will be in their own group bc dates. they’re bringing adam. i know zoe’s going with april and jody

jazz music
please
I literally know like nothing about siv
Please come to siv

(come to siv)
You'll end up where you're meant to be and if USC makes a big mistake then its 100% their loss
It's ok gene
Y E E T
Usc?
I'll probably still be crying and recovering from mine at 5 tomorrow
Go to siv and watch my rejection in real time.
<@258094439636008971> 7 tomorrow
What time again?
It will be fun to hang out! Just chat if we don't dance
Most of us are
Is everyone else going?
I don't really know what to expect out of siv, so I might just be kinda awk there lol
I think I might busy but idk yet
I will add my voice to the peer pressure; you should to to siv
Go to siv gene
<@258094439636008971> are you not coming??
Oh, have fun!
Siv
What's tomorrow for you?
tomorrow is the big day
penis
<@184405311681986560> marry me
<@184405311681986560> i love you
now to put this advice into practice
solid advice
good video
it's still the best video he's every made
watched video expecting a joke video, was not disappointed
*for
stupid
simple
it
keep
it's supposed to be for engineering but it really applies to every thing, kiss
because if wait for them to ask you're just throwing more stuff in-between rather than just getting to the point
don't wait for them to
<@!271149039020408843> also, ask yourself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-4IAR_9Yw
specifically the end of this video
lol
lmao
could just be nice
..?
to avoid the "she could just be Canadian" possibility
I suggest being straight forward as well
^
<@271149039020408843> depending on the guy, just being female is probably enough
that's a train bound for disaster :p
L
🤷
herself
then who's that lol
following the previous train of logic clearly the best person to ask is someone with no personal experience and only broad theories
jeesoo, are you just asking for general tips or...?
L
and I want to stop doing it
girl idk what I'm doing
or maybe jane, but she's not in this chat anymore haha
:p
lol
you might want cindy for this instead
who were you planning on asking
How to be so dashing and charming that a man completely falls for you in 0.2 seconds
Rather I might ask for some advice
no tea :(
welp this is my life now i guess
<@!271149039020408843> don't keep me hanging like this lmao
sirvanoslo por favor
que es el te
I have tea
i'm sure you'll do great
we'll see about that
eh
nah you'll be fine
Ls
good luck
fair enough
that's what i did for last year's too
the writing style isn't right, but i can readjust that
anyway
idk
yeah
that'd be interesting
and like... redacting
because she's new to writing right
so she wouldn't know how to spell everything
strikethrough would be a very interesting device to work with too
that'd be interesting
huh
lmao
because if you wrote a diary i wonder if you'd get marked off for spelling words incorrectly
just a vignette
nope
are you writing a diary?
i was thinking of handling when michael comes to visit her before she's released and then grappling with the implications of the choices she made after that
like after she's learned to write
i'm gonna need to redo part of my rationale-ish but rn i'm working off of writing from hanna's perspective in prison
what did you pick?
but it's okay
i might have picked a bad topic for the reader
i think
"yo move your tree to middle bruh"
I want to see someone write a rap about TTL
TTL isn't plot based and The Reader deals with difficult topics
I do'nt know how to write creatively about either of these books
but it's okay
my gatsby one was so much easier to write
i'm having fun... mostly
currently working on wt1 tho
ahhh
N O
something something velvet wrapped steel
those are b a d
bc oh good lordy
is to never write as badly as Maas's sex scenes
my life goal
a c k
sequels are never good
it's ok
it's the last one
odd
the armor composition just looks really...
i don't really like the cover
ngl tho
AHH
THE WORLD REALLY IS ENDING
NO
no
...
is the world ending
.... uh
<@!340319804747415553> <@!503787499605458954> guess what
Thank you. That was actually pretty important to hear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KShfEMy8UZQ
I mean, I don't blame them for being suspicious when I was winning all of the categories. The truth is sometimes difficult to accept.
google form
they're probably gonna do a google doc
yeah there were some shit poll options lol
probably
more anonymously
will it be reorganized later
true
also at that point it kinda felt like poll party not a real voting thing so
yes
you know matthew he's super on top of things and organized and specific about getting things done
oh yes makes sense
ahh that makes sense
bc its kinda stupid to have anyone be able to nominate anything and be able to see who's voting for who
why
L?
i showed him and he was lowkey ticked
i was at film club and matthew came up to me and asked if he could use my facebook to check if the yearbook awards were actually online
what happened
when i saw only non-ib kids were nominated
lmao no i was with matthew when he was protesting about it
and some non ib kid got buttthurt
???
people are speculating that its bc the ib kids were winning literally everything
whyyy
but someone took down all of them
the polls for senior awards were on Skyline Class of 2019's fb page
damn tea
I don't blame him lol
I like how that's the only part Alan responds to lmaoo
if my life ever depends on having a good cup of tea, <@!478706068223164416> is my go-to guy
anytime
thank you for your input
Ice tea and Boba are completely different stories
That's, of course, my preferences for hot tea
And if I'm feeling adventurous, a fruit tea
I prefer Jasmine most days, with any type of green tea as second, black tea for when I need a wake me up, and earl grey if it's a rainy day
Summary:
-Cindy, Jiayi, and Salina replace Harry Potter trio
-Cindy steals a bunch of alcohol with invisibility cloak
-Jiayi tries to be a degenerate and make a catgirl via polyjuice potions
-Nothing exciting really happens. It's just everyone being degenerates in a boarding school for 7 years I guess.
night, love yall
G'night
Do try to get some rest tho
O O F
Alright, no worries
I promised myself I'd finish my econ ia tonight lmao
I think I'm gonna leave guys sorry
fuck me it's 1:40 am
I don't care enough to correct it tho
thanks salina
oh lmao I didn't even notice the typo
Do it to Reinsch
or like steal stuff and use it as evidence to report her for abuse/torture lmao
Or obliterate that spelling of umbridge
why didn't he just absolutely obliterate umbirdge's office
You have a responsibility
ok but if harry had a fucking invisibility cloak
Yeah, but noseless cw
I'm here for a good time not a long time
Cindy, the protagonist, dead from alcohol poisoning in only her second year at Hogwarts
I'd probably break into teachers offices
Oh my gosh lol
from the tavern
alcohol
from the kitchens
food
But how much and what
probably
steal
I'm kinda concerned what Cindy's gonna do with the invisibility cloak
but actually having ears and tails would be terrifying
cat costumes can sometimes be hot if done right
big facts
But never in real life
Ok the thing with cat girls is that they work in anime
Just stand in front of a mirror and repeat "Alright" and "Jared Diamond" until the effects wear off
Would you not wanna to become Paananen?
I mean
<@233062637922025472> comments?
Also damn rip paananen
L
F
Sorry Jiayi
Prob trying to spike that shit with cat hair to try to get the perfect cat girl or something
Paananen's gonna wake up and wonder why his head's shaved one day
If we’re talking Jiayi from like a few years ago
Well
What are y'all using it for?
that opens a whole other world of possibilities
Soo
Lmao Cindy's Harry, right?
polyjuice potion
duuuuuude
nothing like discreetly making wizard drugs in the bathroom
so like not like you'd be the only one
<@233062637922025472> sure, to a ghost
plus harry was in said bathroom a lot for questionable reasons
yikes
That would be awesome
Maybe you walked into the wrong bathroom at night. It's a boarding school
Might even lose my virginity
That's true
Anything could happen
7 years
I'm kidding
I mean
Have higher expectations of me hahaha please
Okay guys I know I fall asleep a lot but I hope you don't really expect me to fall asleep in girl's bathrooms
wait on second thought I feel like gene fits best as neville
fucking a ghost
sure
lol
<@503787499605458954> I guess it's the more realistic Hogwarts with more teenage sex?
<@233062637922025472> explain yourself
👀
why was he in the girls toilet to begin with? who knows
that raises so many questions
F
In the middle of a quidditch match?
yikes
moaning myrtle's bathroom
Over the course of 7 years, where's the funniest place Jiayi falls asleep?
Ok, so now that we got some of this figured out
I can be an asshole
just a bit pretentious
he's a good kid
no he's not
ernie's an asshole tho
gene you're ernie
ERNIE
no
Who's the most interesting person that dies? That should be me.
was it eric
gene is the hufflepuff friend
oh fuck I forgot his name
maybe david should be fleur
lmfao
*I N C O N C E I V A B L E*
the word to use here is
ahem jiayi
durmstrang's removed from hogwarts just like running start is from skyline
anyways
lmao
slow down there nice guy
Salina doesn't want to marry me? Unbelievable!
it all fits
I meant characters
idk why I said stuff
ok well my point still stands if we're casting people as stuff
sorry jiayi
than marry jiayi in this hypothetical lol
i would sooner say yes to noah proposing to me with a laptop
so yea probably
mildly evil
european
northern
but like implied somewhere cold
n o
So Jiayi and Salina do get married then?
idk it was never stated
is durmstrang russian
lmfao
u wish
bow down
I'm brilliant
literally the side ho
goddamn
NOAH IS VIKTOR KRUM
IF SALINA IS HERMIONE
WAIT
WAIT
WAIT
my side ho
In this distorted meme world, what's Noah's role?
p i r
Rip?
... or that idk
IB diploma was all an illusion to keep us hidden from the true evil
tbh i vote hennig
Lmao
voldemort........................ but in flannels
why must you put that image in my mind
oh god I'm
lmfao
Cw without a nose scares me
cw
Cuz that's what's already happening
We'll make a meme out of it
Pick anyone
wait no she works better as umbridge
reinsch
oh fuck
uhhhh
oh lol
unless I still also have to deal w voldy
<@503787499605458954> Who's your Voldemort?
ok but I don't see salina tolerating that for long
I can see it tho
Rip Salina
Lmao
they ended up just copying hermione's shit half the time
Hahaha
IB at Hogwarts?
We're keeping our past experiences, so IB is a part of our pasts
honestly didn't harry and ron have that exact problem
How would our extreme lack of motivation affect us at Hogwarts?
Except I'm group 2
Oof me, Jiayi
Snow days kill my motivation to do anything so now I'm glad I had group 1 for FOA
mine is nonexistent and I might email her asking to go after state tbh
It kinda sucks to have an FOA to worry about, what with all the snow days and break
Mine is like half done
That joke was too easy, so I didn't make it
Yw
start that
I need to
fuck lmao
A
O
f
F
Oh also FOA
Let us know if there's anything we can do to help
That’s what I get for stacking state with scioly
Eh
Good luck tho!
Oof I'm sorry
ah
you doing ok?
I got some shit to do
I think I'm the semi-important death towards the end
oooooof
No sleep for the stupid tonight
bye much love
Good night
Lol
Oof g'night
Anyway I gtg again
How oddly appropriate
Fitting
Nope
<@233062637922025472> you got any siblings?
HUSH
GENE
Ah yes
Yeah
Ginny
Ron's sister?
No marry pls
Which <@340319804747415553> that sounds like something Hermione would've said at the start of this
Who did Harry get with?
I barely remember
Yeah
Oh yeah he did
yea lol
My god it's been so long
Wait did Ron marry Hermione?
I'm not the type to hold onto a mildly creepy crush for 30+ years tho
He's got the beard and the extra years too
Paananen is Dumbledore
am I that greasy
Eh
oh jeez
For some reason I just imagined Cindy as like Professor Snape when you said anti-hero
g
I'm deceased om
L o l
LOL
i hope not
Will probably not marry Jiayi in this
Salina... Uh
Jiayi is Ron with more naps
lmaoooo
Cindy's basically an anti-hero
We just slapped like the meme version of the trio in
it's levi*o*sa
Yeah
it'd probably be salina
if we're basing it on harry/ron/hermione
Go with it
Ok whatever
I'm a Hufflepuff tho
Cindy, you and me
You
Who's the third member of the trio?
<@233062637922025472> depends?
A Hogwarts story revolving around Cindy and Jiayi being a meme would be interesting
Would it be better in quidditch to have a smaller frame or a bigger frame?
I'd be awful at quidditch, I'm pretty bad at sports that aren't some kind of hitting game
it works
and aren't most of you like diametrically opposed to exercise
I'll be the Ron of this story, that chill dude who goes with the flow, is a bit awkward. probably fucks up a lot, but still somehow works it out in the end
And true
Answer is me
aren't most people
That's the tea
Who would trash at quidditch here?
I feel like I'd be a chaser
Sure
can I do that
I really wanna play quidditch
<@233062637922025472> C O N T R I B U T E
I forget why but it was for irony
oh and I got appointed protagonist for some reason
we went w hogwarts bc it's easy
We're all in Hogwarts. Cindy is the protagonist. How does it go down?
gene was like if you stuffed us all into a fantasy world what would happen
It's a hypothetical
What is this?
welcome
JOIN US FOR THIS
hello
JIAYI
Oh dang I missed a lot of interesting conversation haha
HE'S HERE
Jiayi is there to take random naps, and he's probably a common meme point
But nothing too crazy
I'd be down for a certain degree of chaos
Lol
I was gonna say helen and salina would prob make up the Trio but if we're doing hogwarts they're probably both ravenclaws and also if my mission is to just wreak chaos on everything idk how down they'd be
<@503787499605458954> Turns out the majority of your friends aren't gryffindors. Forced plot time.
thanks
I'm trying to pump life into my hypothetical
oh oops
Is no one going to correct <@503787499605458954> that it's "retroactively"
Jiayi and Kenneth?
Oh, I know. One sec
Hmm
who else is a gryffindor here
make friends w peeves instead of hating on him like everyone else
All of us are there too
oooooooh
What you do
You get to bring chaos upon Hogwarts for 7 years
k then
wat
So
Also, that thing about you dying won't happen now cuz plot armor
<@503787499605458954> You're the protagonist now. Have fun.
Booooo this tea lukewarm
not really?
Do we have a protagonist and an antagonist?
Well, anyways
Lmao
idk if they'd bother
would there
I imagine there would be reprecussions
and students trying to engorgio their dicks n shit
I'm just saying if hogwarts was real there would totally be sex happenin
though she's doing her best at ruining the series retrospectively
she didnt
Lmao
no thank god
<@503787499605458954> did you want her to go all throne of glass on the books
Why?
honestly would not be surprised if I died young in this world
Im only excluding him bc I still don't know him well enough to incorporate him properly
W H O  D O  D I E
Is there any plot while we're here? Does anyone die?
I mean, I guess he's in a literal different state
My autoincorrect is my inner saboteur
No u
O o f?
sorry man
Ah shit
cole
No I
Who's the honorary muggle?
though the ones I really identify w are gryffindor and slytherin
Ive been sorted into everything but hufflepuff
Someone call the Divergent franchise
Been sorted into everything but gryffindor
What batshit shit do we do?
So what happens to us now that we're all separated? How do y'all feel about this?
<@503787499605458954> If there was more of that, it don't do the sell
<@520095106888630348> I can see it. Interesting.
it changes all the time but supposedly ravenclaw
yea I've always thought the distinct lack of teenage sex and Interesting magical experimentation was the least realistic part of that whole universe
Let's be real tho, taking a bunch of Skyline students, giving them access to magic, and placing them in a boarding school for 7 years will lead to some sketch shit
Not really tho
unless you have strong feelings denying that
you totally are
I've been told I'm a Hufflepuff
wait what are y'alls hogwarts houses
lmfao
This got weird fast
What no
and Helen and I get together?
But none of us are related, so no incest memes in this Christian Minecraft server
oh no
the wangs?
so cindy and gene get together?
battling for the throne
Oh yeah
Wait what
weird incestuous romances
That happens in like all of these tho
destruction
death
Why would it be funny
I feel like hogwarts is the easiest one
I just thought it'd be funny
nah it's good I haven't watched or read all of it either tbh
If you want tho, I can try
rip
I don't actually know game of thrones well enough to help you with that
lmao
game of thrones
It's a flexible one we can always revisit too, so ima pin it
Pick a setting, and we'll all run down it together
I mean
this is such a complicated hypothetical
Aww alright. Thanks, Salina. Get some rest!
sorry for taking like a day to respond to your dm
get sleep
love u
Now’s not a great time for me so I’m just dropping by to say have fun y’all
Hi
@here I invite you all
I've been hyped for this hypothetical for like half an hour
New hypothetical:
Place all 16 of us in any fantasy setting of your choice (Middle Earth, Hogwarts, Star Wars universe, etc.). This is all very sudden to all of us. If applicable, some of us may magically just be good at stuff (e.g. Hagrid tells us we're all wizards, someone has an abnormal amount of midi-chlorians cuz lol). What happens to the group? Does anyone die? Who prospers? How do we interact with the world? What's the plot? What if we have to live the rest of our lives there?
Ok
But you know you better than I know you
You're definitely not Chaotic Neutral
so I'd probably also place myself as chaotic neutral
I think when I took an actual alignment test I got closest to both chaotic good and neutral evil lmao
<@503787499605458954> so wbu?
A good Chaotic Neutral is someone who you don't have to tell, "bitch, it's Chaotic Neutral, not Chaotic Dumbass" but rather, "wow, you're really a fucking bitch"
Noah is the embodiment of Chaotic Neutral
hm actually yeah I can see that
Noah's def more chaotic than me
I'm actually not as chaotic as people think
Uh
G'night Helen
where would you place yourself
w the alignment chart thing
wait ok that just made me think of 2 more questions
night love
gene is probably second
I think I'm the most chaotic person here
Bye
I gtg sleep regrettably
not "ugh I have to deal w this person hating me" chaos
Lol I get you
Cindy is def more chaotic than me
fun chaos
but like
Lol
I Love me some chaos
Mmmm unless you enjoy chaos
sometimes it's kinda unavoidable tho
true
Making enemies is a waste of time and effort
big think
Not inconveniencing others also helps me because fewer enemies is better
You know you better than I know you
lol
Basically I'm only motivated to do things if it directly helps me
yeah also everything I said about helen in this particular case applies to me as well
Well, ok
But unlike you I don't go out of my way to help people usually, especially not people I don't have close connection to
I'm nice in the way that I don't like to be an ass to people and prefer to do good rather than bad
no lmao all good
Also, sorry for the slow response. I was writing the juiciest hypothetical since the house thing.
agreed, I'm just saying other peoples' feelings aren't often her primary concern
Helen is super nice tho
I'm not saying this is a bad thing at all
That's an oof tho, but I guess I get it
yeah
It accounts for a lot of the difference between how we interact with people
and it's a p big one
I feel like that's the major fundamental difference
but you get my point right
I know lmao
I'm kidding
false
Cindy is like "see the difference is she's more of an asshole"
Oof?
not to say she isn't empathetic or can't be emotional
Lmaoooooo
helen is not
gene, I feel like you're an inherently empathy/emotionally-driven person, you approach friendships w a lot of concern about the delicacies of how people are feeling etc
ok see ignoring any shared interests/hobbies
Probably Katya then
I think Salina or Katya is most similar to me
hm
well maybe katya
Hmm interesting
<@472541429130854421> more similar. You were the next closest in my mind after Emily
and from my perspective you and gene are very different so I'm surprised gene said maybe you
<@258094439636008971> do you think you and I are more similar or different?
tbh I still think it's salina for you
Well
That makes sense
I guess we seem outwardly pretty similar
How so?
Ya
Hmm interesting
Most similar?
<@503787499605458954> ok, I see your point now
<@472541429130854421> I honestly think it's David for you but ok
god helen
what happens when you sleep at a reasonable time
It's 10:20 here
lmaoooo
I need to live in Hawaii forever so I can actually have a conversation with you guys
yep
Also, is it 12:20 over at home?
but we typed him as an istp and I'm an estp, so. same primary functions, just ordered a bit differently
Yes let's talk about mbti
no one's gonna understand except helen
oh and if we do include mbti
just the *most* similar out of this group
and again, I still think we're super different people lmao
-overblown appreciation for Aesthetics
-like a good adrenaline rush, bordering on reckless
-like efficiency
-general assholery (expressed in different ways, but I feel like we both frequently come across as callous to other peoples' feelings. I think I'm overall more of an ass but he looks like more of an ass)
-very practical people, interested in the mechanics of how shit works, good w tools/working w our hands
-ambition, want those $$$ (though we approach it from v different perspectives)
-interest in politics (though he's more in jsa just for the social side, he has opinions and they're often quite interesting)
-idk we have fairly different values but we think in semi-similar ways
-degenerate sense of humor
I'm not going to justify things unless you want a specific one because this takes a lot of effort lol
Thinking about this hurts my brain but it's fun
Cindy - we get along well/don't argue and have similar opinions but different priorities and very different MBTI 
Cole - don't know him well but I probably have more differences than similarities to him 
Jane - again more differences than similarities. She cares a lot more about people than I ever will lol
Jiayi - we're good friends, relate on a lot of things, and we're similarly outgoing and chill but we have pretty different motivations 
Kenneth - don't know him well. I think if we talked we might run out of things to talk about, so not much similarity here. I don't think we're complete opposites though.
Gene - I'm not sure if we have more similarities or differences. Probably a balance of both. We handle most situations very differently and have different priorities
Zoe - she's kind of similar to my mom so I know she's neither the most similar or most different to me
Noah - near opposite to me except that we both like data and are not social butterflies though in different ways
Jeesoo - I think we have similar opinions on a lot of things and common sense (from my perspective) but we are socially different and handle situations differently
Katya - more similarity than difference. I think I might be most similar to her, although she's more socially active than me.
David - we get along well and have a decent amount of similarity socially but different attitudes towards various things 
Emily - once upon a time I might have been her level of nice but now I am a rock so we're not very similar 
Salina - I have the most conflicts with her out of the people I interact with regularly, so I'd say we're pretty similar but with a few key differences
Alan - similar appreciation of humor and pretty chill but I'm not sure what else we have in common
to justify similarities:
But really? I totally thought it was Jiayi after reading that lol.
bc I decided before making it
I know
You skipped over Noah in the list lol
he just sucks at dealing w and expressing those feelings
honestly, he has a much better moral compass than me, and is also a lot sweeter and more sensitive on the inside
(thankfully)
so we're still not that similar
I think I'm very very different from all of you personality-wise
and it's with great reluctance that I admit I think the correct answer for me is noah
so that narrows it down to: helen, jiayi, sasha, katya, noah
sasha - birthday bro. possible option, though he seems smarter, funnier, chiller and more put-together than I am lol
zoe - a thousand times more hardworking. v stressed/anxious, a lil shady, lots of fun, super sweet. but we have very different outlooks on life
jeesoo - lowkey hilarious, highkey brilliant, and a total sweetheart. like gene said, far more creative ability. gonna have to eliminate this one
david - got that kind of quiet kindness/intelligence that I am v far away from personality-wise. yea prob closest to my opposite here
katya - similarly outspoken, semi-introvert semi-extrovert energy, but actually organized, whip-smart, awesome sense of humor but it's p different to mine. possible option but probably not
emi - again, way more empathetic than I ever will be. soft. cares about other peoples' feelings a thousand times more. smart + talented in v different ways from me. gotta say no
alan - idk him well unfortunately but I get the sense that we're p damn different
gene - a softie. sweet, wholesome, far more emotionally/empathy-driven than I ever have been or will be. that's a no.
helen - hm. we both like to be in charge, good at organizing stuff, both very logical/reasonable people, enjoy a lot of the same stuff (my go-to bitch for actually Doing something together). one of the things I appreciate most is that you're almost as difficult to offend as I am. so possibly most similar? we're still v different though. I have way more chaos energy
cole/ken - n/a
jane - genuinely nice. relatively put-together, a lot more soft-spoken than me. really appreciate her moments of savagery/minor blood feud w one noah righi + practicality + overall kindness, but this is def not it
jiayi - so so so chilled out. nap buddy!! shares a sense of shamelessness, though he takes it to heights I can't even touch. possible option
salina - literally objectively several times smarter than me. shares love for learning but also a lot more like Intellectual and academically-inclined. simultaneously more idealistic and more cynical than me (???), likes to seem tough but a total Softie on the inside. this is a no
And if y'all have questions yourselves, y'all obviously get a turn if you want
You guys finish this first
Ooooo, I got another fun late-night question for later too
I'll use the order people appear on my list
Good idea
I pinned what I was referring to cuz you weren't here
Run through everyone in the server and compare yourself
Most similar... That is difficult lol
?
If you really wanna know, do what I did. Force yourself to come up with reasoning, and it'll become clearer.
We're all relatable in that sense
Personality wise I'm also different from Emily and Jane for similar reasons
My life is a meme so like
Y'all can use me as a cop out, since my existence is a constant mood
I don't know Cole or Kenneth well but I think I'm very different from both of them
I need to look at our member list for this  lmao
literally no one here shares my interests
yea
Not considering shared interests?
i have no idea
Personality only?
who are you most similar to and most different from lol
Hmm
just
so
we did differences earlier
we're doing similarities now
Are you talking about similarities or differences?
lmao
again, twins separated at birth
nurture > nature, but the twin connection is still there
lol tru cindy
Ooh I am here for mbti
bc we have VASTLY different attitudes towards people and the world and generally think in very different ways, yet we say the same shit at the same time more than p much anyone else
I find the twin thing really funny/interesting
jane hbu?
probably. i was originally gonna say helen tho. but probably emily
yea I'd go emi
so Emi
damn
gonna run through the list based on the order discord has us listed:
cindy - i mean, we do joke that we're basically twins, but we have somewhat different interests
cole - jane literally just said i could be his opposite, so no
jane - i could see it, but the difference is that jane actually has the ability to be productive and make impressive stuff sometimes
jiayi - while neither of us have our lives put together, both of us have our lives not put together in very different ways
ken - maybe, but i feel like our personalities are p different
me - N/A
david - there are some strong similarities, but david's better about staying calm under pressure
sasha - no one can compare to the meme lord
noah - no fucking way in hell. disown me if this ever becomes a reality. (love you tho noah)
helen - this might be it. only difference is i make a scene out of myself way more.
jeesoo - one of us has way more creative ability than the other. it ain't me. also, i embarrass myself in public more
katya - we're both p social and outgoing, but a very different type of social and outgoing
emi - i got here, and i have no counterarguments, so this might be it
salina - opposites
alan - alan is way more chill than i'll ever be
zoe - zoe is similarly super energetic, but she's way more organized than me
it's an elimination thing lol
I know?? it's so much harder than who you're most different from
this is a hard question
(also, i agree with your reasoning)
ooo hmmm
oh who do you think you're most similar to in the server
so like it's hard to categorize based on specific personality traits when we're all vastly different people
and then if I try to go more specific, like most of our similarities are p surface-level
but the whole ib thing worked out p well
like for example everyone here is p smart but some people have more defining characteristics so I'd put them somewhere else i.e. you're super wholesome, but that doesn't mean you're not smart yknow
ok the problem I'm running into while trying to do the category thing is that there's always some overlap
if the organization is subject to opinion, then everything might as well all be one category, as a professional smash player could walk in and think everyone's "bad"
but wouldn't that defeat the purpose of having categorization?
they are
*maners voice* but aren't those descriptions relative? if you pulled in a professional smash player, they wouldn't view anyone here as "god" tier
god - sasha, david
good - gene, noah, alan (I assume)
passable - salina, jiayi, maybe me
bad - all the other girls
Bad
Passable
Good
God
just to varying extents
but you all have skills
make categories for smash skills
this is under tea for a reason
make it interesting
so i guess personality i guess
i feel like noah might try to stab some holes in that categorization, but he's not here
like is it by personality, does it have to be a somewhat even split
are there other rules
so I'm gonna try to think of something else
but that's boring
ok the obvious categorization of the group is ib dip/ib cp/running start/actual college
search it up if it sounds interesting
whatever I don't think anyone actually wants me to try to explain the cognitive function stack
4 "temperaments"
0.o
the 16 are divided into 4 groups
groups not types
i thought there were 16 of those
ok that makes things quite a bit easier
ohhhh
<@!520095106888630348> mbti groups
the server
or people in general
what are these?
am I categorizing this server
oh wait
NT - salina, helen, I'd also put jiayi sasha and maaaybe katya here
NF - you, probably jane, probably jeesoo
SJ - david, emi, maybe zoe
SP - me, probably noah
ill take your word for it, cuz im too lazy to think about it lol
probably
do we even have all 4 mbti groups in here?
ok my gut instinct is to just go w the mbti groups lol but if I had to come up w something myself...
ooooh
TOK-inspired question: make four categories of people. it doesnt matter what they are, but there can be no intersection. defend your creation.
continue then
hm alright
i'd go mostly with what you have tbh
who would you pair together
oh?
ok, new late-night question time:
still I'm curious
i can think of a few better ones, but it'd disrupt too many other pairs for the sake of marginal improvement
or at least have like 1-2 really similar aspects
a lot of us are fairly similar personality-wise
it's not but idk if anyone else would work better
it's not the best pair, but you could get away with it
no offense to them I'm just not close enough to judge
that's what I was thinking if I just ignored ken and cole
yeah
alan - jeesoo
wait
ehhhhhhhhhhhh
alan - cole?
I think zoe - jiayi is the most perfect one
no
you could do cole - zoe and jiayi - kenneth if you're willing to go back on zoe - jiayi
cole definitely isnt kenneth's opposite. i'll give you that.
maybe helen - sasha
so I'm gonna go gene - salina
i dont either, but i could kinda see it
hmm interesting
I don't know cole or kenneth well enough for this
gene you could be Cole's opposite
<@184405311681986560>
oh wait
i was about to say you, but then i remembered all the twin moments
so maybe salina?
I know
yeah
I'm having a hard time deciding there
wait, that's only half the people
who do you think you're most opposite to
noah - jane
me - david
emily - katya
jiayi - zoe
actual interesting late-night question:
we have an even number people in the server. using only the 16 people here, match everyone with a direct opposite to the best of your ability without using anyone more than once.
or like, milk tea or teavana, but those barely count and I don't really know what's in them lmao
peppermint tea!!!
idk if i've ever had peppermint tea before now that i think of it
mmm interesting
And peppermint tea
Green tea
<@!478706068223164416> especially you
late-night question: what's y'alls' favorite kind of tea?
Valid
you've said some things
<@!258094439636008971> idk
i'll take it
I'm no saint, but at least I ain't a degenerate
thanks man
*virtual hug* <@340319804747415553>
D:
Tag anyone who isn't Noah or Cindy
D:
Id send you a virtual hug but clearly I ain't a saint
I NEED A SACRED HUG
D:
trust me the instant the thought crossed my mind I knew it was cursed
positively unclean
i feel desecrated
i need a hug from a saint after that
update: so does cindy
Update: Noah scares me very much
r i p
Indeed it is
that’s the tea
Noah scares me
Guys
I'm absolutely fabulous
Fanta included
That is a face that belongs on Vogue
My natural face includes a soda
Wow what that's your natural face?
I look like I don't have makeup on without makeup
I look older without makeup
you’ve seen me without make up
All the jokes to be made
I want to see <@460689096646590465> looking 12
i’m doing better <@!340319804747415553>
i look 12 without makeup on a sophomore thought i was a freshman i was ready to fight
Lmaooooo
yeah we sure hope you don't
I do not want you to look 12 -_-
LOL
WTB ability to look 12
How’re u doin, emi?
Real t
Lmfao
lol I didn't I just called u back
thanks for picking up <@!503787499605458954> ❤
<3
glad you're doing better I think I forgot to say that
thanks for calling
hey <@!460689096646590465> I love u
L
Rip
This you? I was driving sorry
<@!503787499605458954> pick up
Hey, just woke up. Glad to hear you're doing well. Please take care of yourself in the future. We don't want you getting hurt. But the most important thing is that you're now awake and doing ok. We love you, so let us know if there's anything we can do
we do love you Emi
yeah ofc
i appreciate the concern though
i'm glad that you're okay now
that's good
we just didn't know what happened
i went to sleep
I think my main concern last night at least was that you passed out and/or were not responding for reasons other than you went to sleep
I'm glad you're safe and not hungover Emi
We're glad you're doing ok
i think that clears most things up?
we started drinking at like 8
sorry i’m going backwards in the conversation so this is out of order
if that was the main concern i don’t drink when i’m sad it just so happened that i got fucked over a few days before this sleepover we planned a week ahead of time
i’m not one to drink for emotional reasons i’m just really bad at drinking games
i should probably mention that truthfully i wasn’t drinking with the intention of forgetting that guy
i’m really sorry i stressed you guys out i shouldn’t have texted any of you last night. i really hate being the main concern and the cause of stress for other people since that’s such a burden
third, you guys are not responsible for any of my actions nor should you feel like you failed to stop me from being responsible or whatever
second, arya’s mom bought us those drinks and we were drinking right in front of her
first, i don’t have a hangover i don’t get hangovers
oookay you guys are so awesome and i love you guys so much
i'm also on here a lot
but my number is 425-647-8104
my parents do the confiscation
(425) 281-4452
I mean I've said this before but @ all of you if you ever need someone to talk to please call me no matter the time
Pinned for my sake and ability to remember.
I'll take a look in the morning to see if there's anything like that in the Discord settings. If not, I can look around for bots, or I'll at least pin my phone number in one of the channels.
it might be useful to set up an @ for emergencies
maybe a text message system so you can fiddle around with settings and make sure it has a loud notification
I do too, but as we said earlier, the most we can do for now is hope for the best
I don't think I can sleep rn
I just feel like I should be doing more
I dunno guys
ack
also true
We kinda already have the sad boi hours channel and are up at 2AM anyways. I'm not sure what a system would do. All the resources are there by virtue of our personalities and habits (coincidentally).
true
i'm with jane on this one...
i think it's kind of a fine line here
it's up to that person to reach out for help and it's up to us to be there when they need help but at the same time we can't make a pact to be up at 2 AM every night in case someone feels down late at night
in advance
that requires you to realize and want to prevent a dumb action
idk
of like, message something specific or @ a new role if you're really down/feel like you wanna do something dumb
system of what
do you think it'd be useful to set up a system
Agreed
sure, but we can try to help where we can
That's valid, since we can only do so much
people don't change unless they want to
it's kind of up to emily at this point to learn from this and change her behavior the next time
we're saying this with 20/20 vision
fear makes fools of us all
presumably they'd notice if something went horribly wrong
she was planning to do it with Arya and Arya's parents in the house
just a lil pissed at myself for not noticing
I'm not blaming anyone
I would've strongly advised against it given her current state of mind
but yeah, its a rip
i know
I can't actually stop her from doing shit
ok <@!503787499605458954> i don't think that's fair
we're not her parents
Jane's right that we shouldn't hold ourselves accountable for missing it, but it's a surprise nonetheless
I have 0 recollection but if I'd known I 110% would've tried to stop it
we're not Emily's parents and we can't be tracking and supervising and controlling her
and then we were chatting about other stuff
it was super super quick
I'm really surprised that I missed it tho
now i'm freaked out bc i should've fucking said something
I don't recall this conversation, and honestly I don't think it's our duty to figure out when Emily's planning to drink
and uh
but i was slightly conceerned
at that point, i wasn't getting quite as many alarm bells bc i hoped they would be responsible
fuck me, I can't believe I missed that then
so yeah, she told us
regardless
oof!
so arya's family probably did know then
wait when
because her friend's family was chill
figured it out in like .2s from their jumbled messages but
and then she mentioned that she was gonna drink
that's all
i knew she was going to a sleepover with arya and she was going to talk to the guy
Same
did not know she was planning to drink
yeah
I knew she was going to a sleepover w arya
that's why i knew to ask about the sleepover
She did?
when
she... technically told us
There wasn't much else we could have done differently this time around
I wholeheartedly agree with that
I realize that she may have not drank as much tonight if that guy wasn't such a dick. We've tried to support her through that. I will still support her through that. It's tough. I realize that it's a really difficult situation. But she didn't tell us she was going to drink. There's nothing we could've done to prevent this. The best we can do, in my opinion, is support her best we can in her future conflicts and hope she thinks about how gross she felt this time and not do it next time
I think we have some slight disagreements here, but quick reminder to everyone that we're all on the same team here and trying to help Emily out.
I think that that's valid as well. It's worth giving her advising her not to. However, not to play armchair psychologist, but this is probably a symptom of a larger problem. I'm not saying your approach is wrong, but we as a group of friends might wanna detail a more specific approach to that to attempt to be more persuasive.
rip
I can and will advise her not to but I don't think I can say anything that will make a bigger impact than throwing up twice (?) and having a hangover she has to hide from parents
which i'm not willing to do to an adult. I have no right to tell her what she can and can't do
That's valid, and I respect where you're coming from.
Short of following her around and removing her I don't think I can do anything
If she wants to, she's not going to do it around me anyway and I don't think she's going to ask my permission anyway. There's nothing I can do to stop her
Oh.
Alright, that's good. Pardon my misunderstanding.
I honestly don't think I can influence her to not drink
good
that doesn't accomplish anything
I'm not going to yell at her
And what Cindy said is right as well.
ie; cleaning up puke, how to hide the fact that she's hungover from her parents and from Arya's, the hangover itself
just be nice to her at first ok
My point is we shouldn't add to that. She should have somewhere to turn to.
well she's already also definitely worried about what we think
in the morning i think she'll have more concerns than what we think
She's going to be reading with a major hangover. Keep that in mind.
you've siad it like three times
<@!258094439636008971> i think you've made it clear that we still support her but we're concerned
Just checking.
I'm aware
what we can maybe do in the future
Also, it's worth noting that she literally asked us if we still loved her. I think we should be considering what she's going to wake up to. She can read everything we say.
what are we even discussing right now
if at all
but what i mean is that we aren't really angry
i'm just worried
I'm not disappointed or mad. I'm just worried.
I'm not mad or disappointed just very keyed up and stressed
Obviously she's really down right now and being hard on her about it is not the answer
I'm with Salina on this
i think that's where most of us are
i know
i'm kind of in the space of I'm not mad just disappointed
We should be offering healthier alternatives for coping as well
so it's balancing how much she's beating herself up and being realistic
we need to be honest about her needing to be accountable for what she does when it comes to this kind of stuff, but like gene has said she's not gonna be in the best state
salina's right
ultimately it's her life
when she's sober I'll tell her what I told all of you earlier and do my best to impress that drinking to try to deal w emotional stuff is really not smart
just realistically
`i think we just need to be supportive but honest
` this is basically all we can do rn
I don't think we're being excessively critical
I'm not trying to be judgmental
Well, first of all, we could stop being so judgemental of what happened. Yes, it was a mistake, but she's going to realize that in the morning. She doesn't need her friends shitting on her for it in the morning when she's already in a rough spot.
rip
but like we're already doing that
Gene as nice as that idea is i don't think there's anything we can do
besides just trying to talk her out of stuff beforehand
idk what to do
We should talk about helping Emily instead of having a debate about alcohol's legality. I think her mental and physical health are more important.
but this is not a helpful argument either
i disagree that it has to be in every culture to be continued
none are as ingrained in every world culture
so have other drugs Cindy
She's still gonna be in for hell if she gets in trouble in the morning. We might need to be there to support her.
rip
no, the reason it's legal is because it's been around since the beginning of human history
quote by neuropharm professor
i think we just need to be supportive but honest
the only reason alcohol is legal is because lawmakers are on it
honestly
jesus
^
alcohol is weirdly addicting, drink too much and you feel like shit but you're gonna want to do it again the next time you're sad
We can't, but we can at least be there to support her and be a positive influence
if she really wants to drink I don't think we can stop her
Gene, I don't think we can control her
yes thank you
guys just assuming she won't try again soon is dumb
I'm not ruling out her reaching for the bottle again, but we should prevent that from being a coping mechanism
unclear if she'll remember what happened tonight
and she's definitely going to remember the hangover
^
She's going to have a big regret hangover
if she does then i'm gonna be judging her p hard
wouldn't be too quick w that assumption
Not to mention, if it's as bad as it sounds, she'll feel terrible and be as broken about it in the morning
^
ehhhh
I doubt she'll be reaching for alcohol anytime soon
Regardless of what happened, the fact of the matter is that they're drunk and need our help later, cuz Emi's problems aren't going away just cuz she passed out
ok what i think is Emily seemed p distressed about what happened
I'm just stressed
sorry
We should be talking about what we should be doing to help them in the morning and prevent this in the future
well neither is trying to guess if arya's mom knew
but emi was not thinking straight and we all knew it
this isn't really helpful rn
i agree with gene
let's be clear
I mean obviously emi too
I think both of them were dumb and impulsive about it
Maybe we shouldn't play the blame game right now
arya
Emily or Arya?
whose part
that's true but I still have doubts that her mom didn't know that they were drinking at least something
not to be an asshole but this seems like a really fucking dumb and impulsive decision on her part
but like
arya I have no idea about
emi's been in her feels
Sometimes 8
my parents slept at 10
and trust me, they probably did DOWN that alcohol
My parents sleep at 9 sometimes
it's a weekday
it's not unreasonable that her parents would sleep earlier than 11
and that's assuming they DOWNED that alcohol
which means they were downing alcohol starting at like 11:30
and they were p drunk so i would guess earlier
Well, regardless of what happened, is there anything we should be doing in the morning to help prevent this in the future?
it takes like 30 minutes to feel the effects of alcohol
and I don't think that's the case here
the only parents who would provide a large amount of alcohol to 2 small, inexperienced, and underage girls and then leave them alone are just irresponsible and shitty people
puking isn't loud enough to wake people through walls in most cases
first messages weren't till almost midnight
I'm like 99% sure
I'm 80% sure they just waited till her parents went to sleep to start drinking
now I'm just confused
what
Exactly
I find it hard to believe they were both drinking in Arya's room and throwing up and her parents didn't know
Honestly, idk Arya's parents, but I imagine they don't have a vastly different body type
it doesn't take much to get either of them drunk
This sounds like a lot more than a glass
Emily and Arya are both tiny and women who don't have much tolerance apparently
not what sounds like a bottle or two
and that's like a glass right
ok but there were other adults
They would have to be p drunk as well to offer
there are tons of parents who provide kids with alcohol but most would supervise?? w the philosophy that it's better to drink w them vs. drinking somewhere else on their own
It's only legal to do it for your own kids on your property
That's p fucking illegal
a lot of parents are NOT okay with taking on that kinda of liability
Other people's kids
no
Not like
Yes, but only their own kids
^
Probably like "Arya's mom is cool for letting us do a sleepover on a Monday/leaving us alone"
no there are tons of parents who provide kids with alcohol
I just don't think the scenario you're imagining is realistic
Y'all say my parents are cool, but they'd shank your asses if you tried to drink in our house
unless she's connected to the situation somehow
kind of random to say
That could be for any number of reasons
... yeah
yes I'm aware
could mean many things
ok well "arya's mom is cool"
Yeah
I know a grand total of 0 parents who would be ok w that
She probably had work in the morning and went to bed early
not like she was supervising the whole thing
it does sound like two kids drinking in a room but it seems like her mom was like "have fun kids" and left the room
^^^
if her mom knew I highly doubt she'd let this get this far
But yeah. A lot of families have like shelves of alcohol or in the fridge. It's easily accessible.
lol rip
Names even
anyways
seriously
gene we're twins
oh ok
Not shoplifting
robbing stores
Probably just from her parents
not like
*from parents
is more concerning
that
Yeah
stealing
this looks like 2 kids drinking alone in a room
i don't know how those two got alcohol otherwise
It's also a Monday night. Her parents probably have work in the morning.
yeah i know
it's not impossible I just don't think it's the case
not wholly out of the realm of possibility
it's a concern
well
idk I also doubt that
I doubt that
because it seems like she's had a lot to drink
which makes me think that her mom knows and possibly supplied the alcohol
I doubt that's the reason they said that
i'm so concerned that she might've passed out?
huuuuuuh
they mentioned like "Arya's mom is really cool"
That would be... Interesting
huh
i think arya's mom does know
i feel like Arya's mom knows
but the other thing I'm super worried about is if her parents find out in the morning
yeah I was just talking to gene about this
I'm highkey stressed
I'm lowkey stressed
Same. I'm worried
i hope she's okayyy
True
she's not online either
Idk, but she's not responding anymore
did she fall asleep?
I hope everything is alright. Please take care and sleep on your side.
Where are you right now? Floor? Couch?
i can’t move
vertrung  is so gross
Just get some rest
Emily, you don't have to worry so much
You're our friend. You'll always have our love and support.
Of course we do
yes
yes
do you still love me
tim his is gross
I'm like
We still love you and want the best for you. Right now, the best thing for you is to get some rest and be careful.
What Cindy said
Don't be sorry. Things will be ok. Just explain you were sick in the morning if you have to
just be more careful in the future yeah?
hey, it's okay
i’m sorry
the puke can wait til morning
get some rest
^^
on your sides
Both of you should just sleep
rip
uh
ofc she is
she’s drunk too
utbshes dueningoop
never let you drink again
yes i understand
did you understand that
wake up arya and have her help clean up and then put you to bed <@!460689096646590465>
never let me dirnl@again
As long as you are ok, everything will be fine
never late me seungmin again
She'll be alright
That's ok
but i think that's implied in the "stay safe"
shoot i wake her up
Please stay alive and careful
yeah we'd like you to stay that way
... and not throw up
we love you and we want you to be safe
i’m alive
just worried
we're not mad
i'm not mad emi
or me
mad
be me
i’m sorry don’t
i don't know emi
^^^
why did i do this
On your side if you can help it
If you're really not feeling well, just sleep
It might be worth waking up Arya but not her parents.
good
ok good
That's good
i stopped drinking p
Are you still drinking?
anyway
Stop drinking
Get some water first
yeah
okay yeah so
yes
i should tell her
insuou tellchwrp
i threw up o arya’s floor what do i do
guys
i xavrc
what's a very childish thing you still enjoy
back to your regularly scheduled late night qs
i don't think i'll be working with him when volunteering starts again
and my partner can't be left alone
the cats were a-calling
oh probably
I dunno
volunteering i think
why did i have to leave again
hahaha rip
right
oooh
whut
that time in issaquah
left when
after you and noah left
we got ice cream
what metric would you use?
nice metric
hahaha
agree
10/10 would eat ice cream with
yeah he seems so nice
he seems like a cool guy tho
i agree
ok i don't know david enough to tell if this is the right spot for him
I have no issue talking about it
it's true and all of you know it already anyways
I like how opposite we've been with this.
I'm just like "N O  E X P O S E"
You're over here all like "bottom. no debate"
my ranking is:
-emi
-jeesoo
-noah
-salina
-david
-jane
-cole
-katya
-sasha
-zoe
-jiayi
-alan
-helen
-ken
-me
Hopefully she's not drinking and more right now
unfortunately we can't really do anything about that now
anyways
mhm
not a solution tho
well glad helen's doing good now
I know it can be tempting to just try to forget it all
take care of yourselves y'all
yeah don't do that
.... o o f
so not worth it
12 shots after your shitty high school boyfriend dumped you?
lol
^^
I'm so sorry about your sister Cindy. I'm glad she's okay
i'm here too!
Agreed. If you need someone to talk to or help you out, you can feel free to call me as well.
do not drink if it's not fun
i don't have experience with this but yeah...
I'll come over, we'll watch movies and cry and eat ice cream
please don't
don't
emotionally charged drinking is just
0.o
call me
you're worth so much more than that
... yeah
my sister almost killed herself fresh year of college
literally one of the worst things you can do to yourself imo is going drinking because you're hung up on someone
honestly guys real talk for a sec
if that's possible
if anything, sleeping with head elevated is prob better
aspiration is no bueno
there's not much else to say other than that
yeah...
^^^^
arya if you're reading this make sure she doesn't sleep on her back
^^
time
not sleep
time***
there's not really anything that can make her more sober except sleep

I don't know if that helps you read, but it's worth a shot
Sleep?
i Br sass

i cabfceas
welcome to the chat
Is everything alright <@460689096646590465>? Please get some rest and take care of yourself.
hi
damn emi
i can’t feel hands
Anyone have any thoughts?
Best guess:
-Emi
-David
-Jeesoo
-Salina
-Noah
-Jane
-Zoe
-Cole
-Katya
-Sasha
-Jiayi
-Helen
-Alan
-Kenneth
-Cindy
Refuse to expose:
-Gene
Would it be a sandwich of the guys or would it be a well-mixed casserole?
F
I indisputably claim the bottom slot thank u very much
Like everyone on one big mega tier list
Ok, so what if we mixed the tier lists
Truth is, while I think I would know, I probably don't actually know cuz I haven't seen myself in an applicable situation
rip?
Y'all will never know this side of me lmao
but again I dunno
I might put him higher
gene is already a huge teddy bear as a friend
hm idk
you don't have to expose yourself but we'll guess
-David
-Noah
-Cole
-Sasha
-Gene
-Jiayi
-Alan
-Kenneth
How's that?
maybe put kenneth last
Fourth time cuz fuck it:
-David
-Noah
-Cole
-Sasha
-Jiayi
-Alan
-Kenneth
I'm not willing to expose myself category:
-Gene
damn lol
lmfao
it was a while
idk if it was a year
like a year into their relationship
i remember making a celebratory announcement card when Kenneth flirted with Emi for the first time
Given how I don't lol
Actually, he probably won't wanna provide input
<@105508293522264064> input?
lol rip
Bottom by default?
he exists
me neither
Me neither
idk ken too well
again I feel like all the guys are at a fairly similar level
What about Kenneth?
idk this
gah
but jiayi shouldn't be bottom either
I haven't seen they're interactions, so I didn't know
i wouldn't put him at the bottom
v sweet with katya
he and katya are super lowkey but also adorable
sasha is like
see idk if I agree w sasha at the bottom either
That too
I feel like most of them have just not had a chance to be romantic
Third time's a charm:
-David
-Noah
-Cole
-Kenneth
-Alan
-Jiayi
-Sasha
Unranked:
-Gene
Yeah none of them are anti-romantic
there's a much clearer hierarchy for the girls
idk I feel like most of the guys are a similar level of semi-romantic
lmao
<@520095106888630348> Then again, he and Peter are just a bickering couple
i can see that
<@!258094439636008971> he might be
Just saying
but I assume noah already told him to shut up
sorry, just want to be cautious
Alan might be a low-key romantic
and abhay I guess
i know chances are low but i'd rather just say it to be careful
Cole is really sweet but he takes a bit to warm up to people
dude none of us interact w gabe except you
but please like try to keep them mum about it
yeah I think jiayi should be higher
I would put Cole after Noah
Maybe
i know
I think Jiayi is more of a romantic than Alan
alex knows, ramya probably knows
I exist on a third dimension
p sure a few of our other friends know
bc if gabe/family got wind of him, he's so dead
but he'd appreciate it if y'all dont air out the news of the laptop
Where are youuuuu
Edit based off of what y'all said:
-David
-Cole
-Noah
-Kenneth
-Alan
-Sasha
-Jiayi
dw
oh he knows
you know I'm right
hi
hey <@!193229269076279298> when you wake up and read this
lol
a dumbass thot
who buys their gf a laptop after like 3 weeks
like come on
none of us actually know cole well except you is the thing <@!520095106888630348>
I think salina's biased but also correct
and i have had to tell him to let chivalry fucking die at this point
like tbh <@!340319804747415553> we're both gonna think our bfs are super romantic because we're with them
he is very much a romantic
I am not on this list because I refuse to expose myself
no i don't think i am
jk
he's in our dna
I think Salina is biased in this
everywhere
TRUE GENE WHERE ARE YOU
noah is like 1-3?
where are you
yea why Kenneth
also
I'd put noah much closer to the top
are we sure?
kenneth?
hard disagree
Ranking the guys:
-David
-Kenneth
-Cole
-Noah
-Jiayi
-Sasha
-Alan
shit the loopiness is setting in
i like cats
rip
I'm aware
Noted
emotions suck don't do it
it's big facts and most of the time I'm p thankful for it
Don't say that
rip
Oof
Same lol
I'm an emotionally stunted ass
mmh not really
no
Aren't we all tho
nahhh salina acts tough but she's a major Softie
i am very sappy and love being spoiled
Soft disagree but ok
i do think my ranking is justified
okay honestly though
Hahahaa
I MEANT PUT
lmfao
oh ok
but i'm still laughing
instead of love
PUT
maybe leave
yeah i know
this is noah levels of lmao
I think he meant like putting you there in the rankings
HOLY SHIT AUTOCORRECT
what is that grammar
lol what
Wait who
`I'd love Salina between Zoe and Katya
`
really??
second
that sounds super sexual
ok first of all
Keep it
Rip done
fuck you too
Lol
I'd put Salina between Zoe and Katya
no
Should we pin this
I agree
I still think it's accurate
or in public
no
so i would not base this off of how sappy someone is to their s/o in private
Do we wanna revise the rankings?
Ik but I don't think I'd be like that in private either
^^
most couples are p sappy at least in private
I cringe reading stuff like that
ok tbh
I don't barf but I'd cringe if I had to write something like that
:p
cash me outside, barfing out back
but catch me barfing in the back
I see good couple not sappy couple
Lolll
honeymoon phase
LMAO
granted
they're probably the "I love you moooore" couple
I can see that
Eh
Y'all are cute don't get me wrong but like
embarrassingly bad
no I totally see it
the dms are like
very sappy
we are
It's not particularly sappy
Aww that's really cute
You guys keep saying that but like
Really?
I am very not sap
I think that honestly one of the reasons why we work
And so is noah
A ducking sap
I am
unsure
maybe swap zoe and katya
I'm surprised by both Salina's and Noah's rankings
I agree with most of that
Emi is too drunk to affirm or deny rn
for girls: most to least
-emi
-jeesoo
-salina
-jane
-zoe
-katya
-helen
-me
We should do this for both girls and guys
Ooooh
Internet has done a d e d
Gimme a sec to swap laptops
like rank most to least romantic
Oh boi
we should do this tier list style
G U Y S
meant to say david instead of noah
I agree based on first impressions
i think either kenneth or david
I vote noah honestly
Lmao
maybe kenneth?
my vote's still on noah tho
we do
but idk
we love yooouuuu
<@!261949028994908170> spill
awww
i feel like david's a lowkey romantic
David is super nice
and i'm def not voting for myself
ooooh i can see that
maybe david
maybe Cole
sasha and cole i dont think so
probably not alan
yeah plus all of the rest of you are super reasonable people
cuz def not jiayi
we are vastly different people
i'm rethinking when i'm considering the competition for the spot...
like I feel like if he'd actually gotten to know me first that would've died p fast tbh
dude no tea no shade but he barely knew me when he had a crush on me
really?
Lol
wait what
not noah
noah
What about among the guys?
I would vote for one of the three
Salina???
I vote emi
i would like to throw my hat into the ring
I never figured out why we're in the tea channel
or jeesoo
er
emi
who's most likely to get caught in a "whirlwind romance"
late-night tea time
pls no
damn cindy
he's got school lol
is tempting sometimes
he's always awake for dick jokes
I admit
which
ok now your'e just trying to get me to hit him
noah's asleep
<@!193229269076279298>
I swear to god if one of you makes a joke about someone's dick going unexpectedly deep I'll slap you next time I see it
<@!340319804747415553> thank someone gets it
damn helen that was unexpectedly deep
laughs in living in big sad
lmao
*looks behind me in panicked confusion*
You decide which is which
The issue is one is familiar to us while the other is a novelty
typically big sad follows the big romance
why have big romance when you can just have big sad
Hurricane season romance
whirlwind autumn romance
So is winter
lol rip
Summer for me is hermit time
Also it would be during the school year
but I mean I don't think she's been in love so idk for sure
how do you judge that lmao
I think helen would be very rational about the whole thing
lol
Nah
hmm
is helen the kind of girl to get swept off her feet
color me intrigued
something something chicago
I meant me
whirlwind romance huh
<@!472541429130854421>
for who tho?
Jacob went to Laban in the first place because his mom was like "it's time to get married. Go visit my brother and see if you can marry one of his daughters"
If life were a fanfic I should expect a whirlwind summer romance to happen within the next few years
oh yeah
i wouldnt have just held a stuffed penguin above my head and smiled like it was the dearest thing in the world to me
no bueno
if life were actually fanfic
Ew
incest porn
actually, now that i think of it
ew
leah, rachel, and jacob are cousins
idk who here actually reads fanfic
*not mentioned
also
good question
lmao
like what's needed to convince you life is just one big fanfic
how many cute gay couples are required for a 8-billion-person fan fic?
Fact: reality is just fanfic
BUT
I guess now that it's legal and opinions are changing there ARE more gay couples
true
there's no good statistic for how many gay couples there were/are because so many are in the closet
<@!503787499605458954> excuse me, but have you seen me and me?
maybe it's true
i mean
<@!258094439636008971> can't be true, there'd be exponentially more cute gay couples
rip!
I think the one he actually loved didn't have as many babies
i give in the other one instead and then he'll work that number of years again to get the one he actually wants
and then he was like hm
the agreement was that Jacob would work for Laban for a number of years to get one daughter in marriage
what if reality is just a fanfic
Jacob was a damn fine shepherd
they kind of are
What if every interpretation of the Bible was counted as fanfiction
y tho
and he swaps in rachel
laban (the dad of leah and rachel): "hold my beer"
i thought it was rachel
"i'm gonna marry her"
Fanfic lol
jacob was like "wow leah is smoking hot"
basically
i cant believe the bible was popular enough to make it 2000+ years and have dante write a fanfic about it
<@!520095106888630348> now I'm curious though
sarah gave her slave to abraham to have a kid with
they're sisters
Is this exponential population increase demonstrated in one generation
yeah i could tell you how Jacob ended up marrying both of them but i don't think you want to know that
the slave thing isn't even the first instance of it
reading the bible is so bad
kinky?
not good
it's
jane's giving you the short version
uh
<@!520095106888630348> seems legit?
old testment is... interesting
<@!258094439636008971> it gets real weird, they gave him their slaves so the slaves could have babies and the babies would count as theirs
girl on girl hate bad
it was for jacob i think
oh
it was Old Testament
tf
yea
and were in a competition to see who could have more babies with him
lame
they were both married to the same guy
I'm here for it
Lmao
there were lesbians in the bible?
uh
wait that sounds like a lesbian couple
yikes
Leah and Rachel??
Time to *not sleep*
those two in the bible
*assuming I wouldnt just shoot you through the window
like uh
uh
you'll have to outnumber us in child production
time to sleep with a knife under my pillow
all you have to do is have a lot of children
:( don't kill me pls
damn
solid
<@!503787499605458954> we can assassinate them one by one 20 years later
bc she didn't complete her divorce before marrying him
that's what they accused jackson's wife of
<@!258094439636008971> lol
search it up
bigamy is a term
that's not trueeee
isn't it just monogamy and polygamy
<@!503787499605458954> if they end up outnumbering us too much, we'll win with our ace in the hole: we retract all emotional support, become hermits, and wait until they destroy each other
<@!340319804747415553> you only want me for the dog
is bigamy a thing
I'll marry both of them
the answer to everything is bigamy
Don't join the Wangs
I'd marry helen tbh
HELEN NO
bigamy, jane
Gene will you marry me
If i marry you then i lose Cole and therefore Skye
Who's going to marry me D:

Wait why are we in the tea channel
O_O
Wang and Li are the only last names
there's 2 last names between the four of us
you're right
<@!520095106888630348> holy shit
i get that. i respect that skill
ah I know a lot of people don't but I reread my faves constantly
but my switch library makes me kinda proud, and i have second thoughts on that now
i was never super huge on owning any forms of media aside from games (since those actually had progress on them), cuz i don't go back to reread or rewatch that often
g
shoutout to my dad for indulging my love for readin
but yeah that's another thing I'm super grateful for, I basically have a mini library in my room
brb, gonna break the spine of one of your books so you can break mine for me
you break the spine of anything I lend to you, I break yours
pretty much all of them are still in pristine condition, I am a total asshole about caring for books
like still
i do that with games
I was the amazon prime kid who always pre-ordered shit to get them on the day of release
alright, i get you
but my books
my other answer is a bit of a cop-out bc it's so all-encompassing
lmao
i think that's when my parents realized they should just get me my own DS lol
oh noooooo
i'm still trying to atone for my sins
i accidentally deleted his save file on pokemon gold (his fav pokemon game to this day)
so uh
i didnt know how to play it, but i thought playing games was so cool
my brother used to let me use his old gameboy
yeah uh
it still works
gameboy
12-year old?
what
another one of mine is my like
yeah
i feel like stuff like phones, computer, and game consoles are kinda precious to people just cuz they bring people their best memories via social media, info, games, etc.
getting more into games that it literally could not run was p much the reason I eventually upgraded though
lots and lots of memories
it was a damn good computer for its time
lol I basically just used it as a desktop
that's p heavy for a 4th grader tho
but i get ya
F
it's like 10 pounds
and it was already several years old before that
I used it from like 4th grade to 8th
my fave object is probably my ancient dinosaur laptop
F
but anyways lmao
ok on second thought idk if that's accurate
if you can function, you're alright
but a high-functioning one
a borderline hoarder
same I'm like
i cant bring myself to separate from a lot of things
same tho
but I also just get super attached to things
lol nw
lowkey materialistic lmao
ok I'm
we grow but we never forget
aww
one of my stuffed turtles is super precious to me too
also my saxophone
cuz like they hold memories (both in save data and actual memories)
any nintendo console i've owned
probably like
lol
my switch
what are your favorite material possessions and why
i think ive heard of this place but have never been
wow
d a m n
they also have boba
which is saying A LOT
probably my favorite dessert shop in the seattle area
that sounds really good
oooooo
putting that down on my list of things to try
last time I went, taro shaved ice + choc syrup + strawberries and lychees
im interested now
bambu drinks & desserts, int'l district seattle
oh my gosh, that's so pretty!
f o o d
s e n d
hang on
I HAVE PICTURES
but good shaved ice is fluffy enough to be creamy
i've never had it, but now i'm interested
bad shaved ice is shit
ok I keep thinking of more but last one I love love love korean-style shaved ice
honestly, any variation of ice cream, gelato, sorbet, etc, is good stuff. i'll just be in the mood for one or the other at different times.
gucci gucci love me some of that gelato
gelato
OH ALSO
i know that's just a me thing tho
red bean soup is like the opposite. it's hot, grainy/sticky, and a muddy sweetness
interesting
to me, if something is sweet, it should be cold, smooth, with a clean/defined taste
i don't like red bean soup
and it's a weird sweetness for me
damn
i just hate the texture
i lowkey hate red beans
honestly
oooooooooh also have you ever had sweet red bean soup
it's literally pure carbs lmao
I'm also a big fan of mango sticky rice
creme brulee!!! hell yes
so good
that's gotta be it
creme brulee
oh
im tentatively putting out chocolate cream pie, but that's probably not it
hmmm
ooooo
i love cream cheese icing, but i know it's p devisive
what's your favorite dessert/desserts in general
tiramisu is amazing omg
I'm weird
oh yeah I like cheesecake but I kinda hate cream cheese icing
I feel like I crave good ol chocolate cake the most though so probably that
one time I made this brazilian coconut cake for a spanish project that was honestly spectacular
I really like most cheesecakes which is weird bc I DESPISE cheese
tiramisu cake is amazing
I asked because I wasn't sure myself
wbu?
and i really like ice cream
cuz ice cream just makes most cakes taste better in general
any kind of cake with ice cream
or just like
probably cheesecake?
cuz i don't like cake too much, so i have to think
oh, that's hard
what's your favorite kind of cake
i met some nice people, had some nice laughs, and grew up in a p nice place
but i'm still p fortunate
i feel like my entire life has just been an "eh, that happened" kinda of thing thus far
they aren't major regrets though, and again, I consider myself extremely lucky
I wish I did more in a lot of cases bc in hindsight I could've started stuff earlier, accomplished more, etc
rngesus strikes again
but like I feel like I've been able to experience a lot more of the world than most our age so far and I'm so so grateful for that
riiiip lmao
like I joke a lot about having really shitty luck on a day-to-day basis (which is very accurate <@!340319804747415553> can attest to my horrible video game rng)
cuz you people are such wonderful people
and that's p damn lucky
y'all are you
also, of course y'all are lucky
awwww thank
idk every now and then I re-realize just how lucky I am
we're all still p smol
aw don't be you're gonna do amazing things in the future
but still, that's actually super awesome. i'm kinda envious lmao
ah, alright
2017
you said it was last summer, right?
that's actually super cool
damn
private embassy tours @ jsa summer school, meeting ambassadors face to face etc. esp the russian one, we had like a q&a session w all the representatives present and it was soooo interesting
wbu?
my life hasn't built up to much yet, but that's ok
valid
im not actually sure lol
uh
i added the 10,000th member to poll party, but i didn't get credit for it, because it didn't register, and someone else got credit for it 5 minutes later
but actually uhhh
it was literally p cool
i stuck my head in a freezer at costco
(so far, obviously)
what do you consider the coolest thing you've done in your life
❤
i have y'all now, so it's alright
rip
having a falling out with a friend of mine from a while back. i've moved on, doing better, and don't care anymore, but i feel for my past self if that makes any sense.
<@!258094439636008971> what's your answer?
Wasted a lot of time energy and affection on people who were asking for help but never acted to actually improve themselves
I don't wanna get too specific but for the 2nd one, trying to help people who didn't really want to be helped
Damn these are good
doing IB
What's something you thought you would eventually feel ok about down the road even though you felt terrible about it then (and terrible about feeling terrible about it), but in reality, you just kinda look back and feel for your younger self?
<@!258094439636008971> do you have more questions
again, what matters is that you felt better afterwards
it's alright
F
lmao sorry
don't remember that either
i mainly just remember feeling bad and apologize over text
true
so that may have something to do with my memory
well after that i went home and slept for three days
i remember this better than you do for some reason lol
i don't really remember what happened after that
or do i
i do not remember that
you went to the bathroom to clean up and then went home
i don't remember what i did
and i think i left p quickly
but all that matters is you were able to go home, get some rest, and feel better
i'd be grossed out if someone threw up on me
i mean
ehhhh, you were the one in need of attention and support, and i tried to be a whiny little bitch
i think your reaction was valid
also, that's valid
tbh, you hardly got anything on me. i just overreacted like the little bitch i was at the time
i'm not glad but i don't hate myself for it i guess
tru tru
it's a funny story
``but you're ultimately glad you did what you did``?
throwing up on you
i'm sure something will come to mind eventually
i can't think of anything
interesitng
Mine would probably be stopping Chinese school. I did it for so long, and I sucked at it, but I thought I would regret not knowing enough Chinese in the future. Stopping was great for my mental health, helped me break out of my cycle,  encouraged me to use the language more with my family, and helped me appreciate languages beyond just learning it out of a misguided sense of responsibility.
lmao
F
he's asleep and i shouldn't rag on him lol
jk
noah?
What's something you guys used to think you would really, really regret later in the future, but you're ultimately glad you did what you did?
no
Cuz I got some good ones
Is it too early for some late-night questions?
no, don't be sorry. you did nothing wrong.
alright. sorry
nvm
?
i can think of a lot of things that are easier to reach that arent necessarily the best decisions
but the letters are so much closer together and easier to reach
well, that's a choice you're consciously making then. can't help you there.
<@!340319804747415553> `Seriously speaking - I'm happy for you guys. I don't wish harm on you if that's what you're asking`
more letters and they're further apart
cuz his username in discord has his actual name in it
you can also do @ + noah + enter
(O ))
(
(O ))
i don't like how the way i tag Noah in this chat is @ + big + enter
also
i'm not serious
me neither tbh
i can't tell how serious that's supposed to be
F
also
rip?
fucking everyone else over and probably will cease to exist soon
i feel like chocolate dildo is a good way of describing <@!193229269076279298> and <@!340319804747415553>
making knives and chocolate dildos
<@!340319804747415553> any thoughts
:)
I must be good at something
It is a wonder <@!340319804747415553> has not left you yet
Seriously speaking - I'm happy for you guys. I don't wish harm on you if that's what you're asking
Out of serious mode - I say congrats because every day this shitstorm continues is a miracle
why don't you just give both
idk
are we speaking seriously
I was more thinking about the `congrats`
<@!193229269076279298> did you think it did?
no that hasn't changed
`i'm gonna make a lot of jokes at your expense` ?
i mean, she has made good on her word
so <@!520095106888630348> has your opinion changed at all since that message
?
damn
L
congrats to <@!340319804747415553> and <@!193229269076279298> i'm gonna make a lot of jokes at your expense
pitt can be a cool guy sometimes tho. there was one time he yelled at me in front of the band in my sophomore year cuz we were prepping for salmon days, and i screwed up cuz i was marching left guide that one day and didn't know how to do a gate turn. after i explain, he took the time to apologize, teach me off to the side one-on-one, and apologized in front of the entire class the next day. i bet he doesn't remember, but i still respect him for that, cuz he's a good dude at heart who's just a bit too lazy to take life seriously and actively be a good guy
i think i've gotten a genuine compliment once from pitt, and it was in a yearbook cuz i wanted my teachers to sign
lmao, it's cool. it's usually in good taste.
sorry dude
yeah gene got shafted
and they're all like
i've talked to other band ppl
yeah
oof
so i've just been his punching bag ever since
what i was in for was when pitt roasted from day one in band cuz i was the only plms freshman he recognized in class, and he wanted to make it seem like he knew more people
it wasn't
was not at all what we were in for in the next 4 years
quality skyline
ok tbh chem as a freshman
nice job, skyline
(and nah, it's cool. dw about me. thank you tho)
there’s a penis on my math desk
color the entire lab station black to assert dominance
what a time
don't bother
i have to erase dick scribblings off the lab station i sit at in bio every single day
if it makes you feel any better
rip
mine was walking into chem, it being dead silent, seeing a bunch of people i didn't recognize who were older and scarier than me, only recognizing <@!167457958211354624> (thank you for being there) and matthew bellevia, walking to my assigned seat in the back corner of a sketchy classroom, sitting an a really weird high wooden chair uncomfortably in silence while occasionally glancing at the periodic table next to me. i looked down and saw that "ur gay" was carved into my desk, and i was like, "oh, so this is what i'm in for these next four years"
I basically don't remember the 1st day of fresh year, funny enough
me, serina, and emily w were a power team in that class lol
first day in paananen's class
mr paananen calling on me in class on the first day of school
1st jsa meeting
what's your guys' earliest high school memory?
but yeah he's also just an awesome person overall
it was great
vindication
i respect that
nice
oh dang
this one time I was like hella frustrated (like near implosion) @ these goons in my group who weren't taking a project seriously, and yeah he pulled me aside and asked if I was ok, then gave all of them shitty grades when I explained
he was my first high school teacher who I felt like actually cared about me as a person
I mean we were just talking about teachers who care
idk him either, but i imagine he's a decent person
I had him fresh year
i never had him...
I adore Mr. Matheny as well
for now
but I refuse to believe
which is worrying
I heard it even before these past 2 days though
oh well
idk it was a really weird rumor
they're not that bad
true as fuck
mmh that's fair
rings are uncomfortable as shit
rings are heavy, man
my parents never wear their rings unless they're going out together
rings mean nothing
reinsch also rants about her MIL in front of the class
my parents sometimes take off their rings i think
my mom doesn’t wear her ring either
that's fair
also reinsch is married but she doesn’t wear her ring
i was wondering
emily has a point
i knowwww
._.
it’s none of our businesssss
idkkkkk anymore
i think she had a ring on her middle finger on friday
why would she still have this last name
either that or she wears her wedding ring on a diff finger
I'd expect to notice something
idkkkkkk
but they've been married for so long?? Blythe and everything????? they were still so in love like a year ago
like I know she's great at just putting on a happy face
i never had her before this year, so idk too much about her personal life, but i hope whatever situation she's in, she's happy and doing well
I kinda feel like if something happened she would act differently though
let's hope that's the case
sometimes people just take off wedding rings tho, right?
dude I'm gonna be so fuckin depressed if they aren't together anymore
and it's true - she wasn't wearing it on thurs or fri
wait what
I am 90% sure this is untrue
ppl were speculating that she got divorced bc she no longer wears her wedidng ring
I've also heard rumors
what?
does anyone know if this is true
wait
OOOOOOO TEA TIME
but i've heard rumors that matheny got divorced?
also this is hella random
Yeah, thanks for asking
You ok now?
Oof
I was panicking and needed something to distract myself with
It had gotten to Skyline fire alarm levels of loud
I could literally hear the alarm from outside the house
Hey, man. I'm not sitting outside at 10:30 PM with nothing to do
Cuz I haven't been doing worl
`GRABBING MY SWITCH AND MY JACKET` #priorities
oh ok whew
And now they're kinda pissed
like that one time you had to quarantine yourself due to smoking vinegar scent
My parents come back half an hour later and just change the battery on the thing
cover the edges of your door with wet towels
So I'm like "NAH, FAM, IM GOING OUT. GRABBING MY SWITCH AND MY JACKET"
or at least quarantine yourself in your room
The alarm just let's out this huge-ass drone/prolonged beep
dude go outside
And like moments after he hangs up
So I'm like considering just waiting outside
So my dad's just said like "yo, just go up into your room and open a window. We're coming home"
C A R B O N  M O NO X I D E
BUT CO DOESN'T SMELL LIKE ANYTHING
I KNOW
But like boi
wait
My dad is like "lol, do you smell anything? If not, you good"
that's generally not a good sign lmfao
And I'm like "uuhhhh k, ima call my folks"
you okay?
UHHHH
Half an hour later, the thing picks up in speed and volume
And I was like "eh, it's prolly just out of power"
Then the carbon monoxide alarm started beeping
Ok, so I was at home by myself without any power
I mean I'd hand off government to it, I just want the kill switch
lol that's also a possibility
but I can't say I disagree
or A.I may come sooner
that's ominous
well
outside of the issues of states' rights and slavery people didn't disagree nearly as much
we will one day
yea currently people don't have a good enough reason to go to war
like you said there were 2 primary and deeply intertwined issues that were at the heart of the civil war vs. today there's 2 wildly conflicting sides to every issue. I just feel like people are more aware that secession and violence really isn't practical and doesn't really benefit anyone? and geopolitical alliances aren't nearly as solid as it was w the north/south dichotomy in the 1800s
we're not special, it may look slightly different but it's the same thing
every civilization has done it
the climate will get as bad as possible until "war" happens
ie mob mentality
I'm pretty sure you could convince most people in skyline to murder someone, all you have to do is to make them think 2199 other kids think it's ok
like no we're not actively killing each other but political-polarization wise tbh I think it might be worse today
mhm
which one? the civil war bit?
idk most people laugh at me when I make that argument but
yeah exactly
it's no longer just two big things, it's literally everything
like the vilification and propaganda on both sides is there, we've just stopped short of resorting to large-scale violence and war
despite how bad I think the American education system is, we are still light years ahead of the civil war in terms of education (obviously), so everyone has an opinion on everything
it's no longer just states rights and slavery
<@!193229269076279298> yeah pretty much
we can argue about whether or not the two-party system should or shouldn't exist, I think most would agree that it's pretty broken, but the fact is that it does, and I don't really have any realistic ideas on how to fix that
`almost more than during the civil war` because of the range of topics?
we are more politically divided than we've ever been, personally I'd argue almost more than during the civil war
not even getting into how flat-out impossible it would be with our current political climate
so no one really has a reason to put in the insane amount of work required to significantly change the constitution
and it doesn't directly benefit the individual who decides to try to implement sweeping reform
as of right now, it's working ok, like obviously it's not perfect but "if it ain't broke don't fix it"
we have more pressing issues, and while many of the small and immediate problems *might* be solved if we actually did a good job of overhauling the constitution, once again it's a problem of collective inaction
for the constitution thing: until there is an immediate incentive, people aren't gonna bother to touch it
gene I appreciate your idealism but
ohhh man
It's been done in the past
We can work against human nature if we identify the specific problems and work to avoid them
you're asking to counter human nature
Parties shouldn't really be built into the election system as they are right now. It should be more of a general yet fluid set of ideas rather than a sports team that you cheer for.
Cuz everyone just mutally agrees "Hm, ok, so we can have more than one opinion. How many kinds of opinions can we have? Well, let's just say two. That's more than one."
Bipartisanism is just super arbitrary in nature
I don't think either is possible with the current two party system
But we haven't done either
To be fair, amending the shit out of the current constitution would probably be more effective than writing a new one from scratch
"no you dim wits, we can do better now"
^
it's like we like the fact ours was the "first" and because it was the "first" it is obviously the best
It's just a little arbitrary to stick to what we have rather than "hm, well, some dead white dude WROTE it! It must be important and perfect because it's THE constitution!"
not anytime soon
exactly
but realistically is it gonna happen
France has gone through what like 9 constitutions in our time
but it can be refined
like I absolutely agree there
I'm not saying we shouldn't amend it more
really really good first try
/is
that doesn't really change how impressive of an achievement the constitution was
I personally am not a huge fan of how the US is set up
there's tons of grammar and spelling errors in the constitution and we will never know if said annoyingly ambiguous grammar in the 2nd amendment was intentional
^
One of these days, we're gonna be laughed for adhering to what's basically a 1700s grammatical typo or something
I mean look at ICE
and federal laws only have so much sway
yea but all of it has to conform to the constitution
vs changing the whole ass constitution
well we tend to make new laws regarding technology
not rewrite
If we make a mistake, we can admit to it
yea we basically cross things out
Ok, but sure
I mean thing about how far technology has come since then
see: prohibition and its repeal
to repeal an amendment you need to pass an amendment repealing the first amendment
ok but
to not update our founding document
It makes sense why we would be so hesitant to approve of new amendments until you realize we can repeal them too
a little bit long
it's been 10.7% of the US's existence since we've past an amendment
there's a display w the thousands of pages of amendments that never got passed
if you ever visit the national archives in dc
yeah
1992
I'm honestly kinda surprised then
when was the last amendment?
<@!258094439636008971> I don't think so
My uncle actually confiscated a rocket powered gun
I'll just make a railgun and stop caring
yea
it's just a hairy issue
like
those kinds of weapons are super dangerous in the hands of the wrong people, which is again the problem with not having to justify it. Like honestly I don't personally have an issue w how the 2nd amendment is interpreted rn, I just think there should be a lot more regulations. And no there's no explicit thing saying you need to justify why you want to own said gun - which is why any 18 year old could walk in and buy an AR-15 to shoot up a school
as unamerican as that would be
Has there ever been a legit motion to repeal the second amendment?
tell the gun companies to regulate i themselves, they get fined for every death using their weapons
I really think the best way to do it would be to make it about money
there are lots of people that do own these types of guns without a problem
does it say I have to justify it though
then the argument becomes what's the point of owning if you aren't gonna use it? like there will be collectors and people like you who just wanna play with the parts but
but tell that to Washington knife law
it's using
but the act of owning isn't infringing
that's fine
we've established that we disagree on the for fun thing
we're just going in circles
and again, it's conditional on not infringing other peoples' rights as well
well grammar does change
which could be interpreted in a million different ways, at least partially because of the annoyingly ambiguous grammar
"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed" snipping this you get a rather blanket statement
and it just says "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed"
I'm not infringing anyone else's rights if I do cocaine, but I really still shouldn't be doing it
I'm pointing out how the bill of rights works
I'm not arguing about that generally
Like drugs for example
If are argument is about when stuff infringes other people's right as a guideline for what should be legal, I just wanna point out that that's not how all regulations work
but not stated
it's implied
they didn't write anything about the reasoning into the law
I think it should be
ok sure but my whole point was that maybe "just for fun" SHOULDN'T be allowed as a justification
at least it's not me
overspray is just the cost
fuck the neighbors
lol
I plan to defend my white picket fence house with a mounted minigun in the front yard
I'd be more worried if they had an alternate reason
you think that has any justification other than miniguns are fun, need I say more
people own miniguns in the US
Idk how to go about that, but that should be way less people if you can actually linit this shit
^yeah that was gonna be my rebuttal if you brought up why handguns are allowed
<@!503787499605458954> no there are people like that
Also, some people want guns for self-defense
You can regulate using guns for sport
good luck arguing "I should be able to own all of them, *it's fun*" in court when they discover your hoard of automatic weapons
I think the fun thing is kinda too vague to be worth allowing
I'm torn
ok but I'm pretty sure you already know why that ain't realistic in the slightest
gun have three uses, sport, killing people, and for fun
bill of rights says you have the right to bear arms, it doesn't specify why
I can own guns for sport, I'm not infringing on other people's rights
I can't own guns for killing people, that would infringing on other people's rights
I can own guns for fun, I'm not infringing on other people's rights
"any" gun can kill someone but I have the right to **some** guns, so which ones, the ones that have a justification that isn't only "used to kill people"
guns that can be used for sport are ok, because they have a "legitimate" reason to be owned
guns that are past the point of **just sport** are not ok though, because they aren't needed for the sport, you can get by without them, and they can infringing on other people's rights
the wrench is **for fun**, all guns are fun, so I should be able to own all them, no gun is **too much fun**, so you always have a "legitimate" reason to own any gun, **it's fun**
true but unrelated to what I was saying
ISD has had a really rough year as a whole
the amount of typing makes me nervous but I'm sure I do this to everyone on the daily too so
or are you arguing that a minigun's only practical purpose is also killing/therefore infringing on other peoples' rights
are you arguing that those have other purposes outside of mass killing
I was talking about assault weapons/maybe semis specifically
yes
mine?
ok now I'm confused on what your point is
but I would argue it does
My parents think guns are useful for self-defense, but I have a feeling that if you to use a gun, you're either already dead or you're shooting first (probably with bad judgement)
it has no purpose outside of that
I think your point is the `only` thing it can do is infringe on other peoples right
it has no practical purpose past that
it's a minigun
there are people that own miniguns because it's cool
(not assault weapons tho)
You can use it for sport without hunting (targets), but at that point
sure, but assault weapons are made for mass killing and warfare
it's just when does the number of living things killed exceed what one person would need
all guns are made for killing living things
I would disagree on that interpterion though
also the military doesn't pay enough
I intend to get my gunsmithing license one day for that reason
go work for the military
I just like making them to make them
but what if I like them from an engineering perspective
imo semis should be included in that bc they're really not necessary for hunting or anything but whatever
well, bill of rights says these are your rights unless they infringe on other peoples' rights, assault weapons are literally just made for killing people, so assuming that they infringe on other peoples' rights to life and therefore banning them from civilians is reasonable
for some reason
but not the right to all them
right to bear arms etc
no matter if it's a semi
True
idk man what I do know is that if you're 18 an want to buy a gun there's really not much that can legally stop you
because it currently affects me
I'm better versed in knife laws
I don't know the exact extent
we have some?
Wait, do we not in Washington?
^
yeah well this is why we need like background checks at the very least
Maybe they were one of those high schoolers who looked 30
a high schooler buying an AR-15 should raise some level of question
at the end of the day they're a business that exists to make money, unless you give them a reason to be concerned they won't bother
they're not responsible for it but they're also not stupid
gun stores aren't responsible for that
like yes I could technically go buy one right now but it be surprised if someone didn't stop me and ask why again do you need this
either your parents with a lack of locks or a gun store with a lack of sense
someone somewhere has to fuck up for you to acquire one though
That's so fucked up
you could technically just waltz into a store
the AR-15 is a civilian semi-auto version of the selective fire M16 designed for military use
if you're 18
well technically the M16 is select fire
16 is auto
yea
An AR-15 is a semi, right?
and how do you do it "stealthily"
parents?
Oh ok
but my point is where the fuck do you get an ar-15?
so you're wrong on both
second photo is a few days old, but also I just tired it and I can hold it at that angle without spilling it
Did you just chug all of that for that picture?
In the second picture, he's holding it nearly flat
In the first picture, it was full of what looked like tea
Hold the shit up
yes it does
I mean this is the receiver to mine, most people can't tell the difference
It does indeed
does your cup say fabulous
well fuck
I feel like it's probably real though why else would they actually arrest people
I'm willing to bet they would've specified "dw we just found someone with an airsoft gun"
fair
airsoft has shocking realistic guns
yea I can see, I do wonder if it's real though, just a bit
it's blurry but you can see it next to the backpack
where did you get confirmation from?
but shit
yeah I think so sorry should've specified
well look on the bright side, it's not an AR-16
Wasn't that in Issaquah?
yeah that was legit
you know the rumor that they found someone w an AR-15
guys
just checking you could read the message
tu punto es?
si
I know you're blind and all
mhm
uh do you see the message above yours
don't you fucking dareeeeeeeee
.... don't you dare noah
i didnt even realize that
see consent was given
I love that those pins go up next to the #no more poster
but anyone that talks to me knows I use `this` for quotes
I can live with that
although out of context, it might look like you said it
wow, noah is savage
cool
we pinning messages
oooo
Salina's making dirty jokes
tf
what is happening
Cindy can join me in crying
start crying bitch
I could cry right now with how proud I am
let's not open that package
...in the group chat
rather not
yikes
unless you want the present to be something else, but I don't think we're going there
...
in this case though the list is the present, so it doesn't work perfectly
....
You better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why
Noah the Bitch is coming to town

He's making a list,
And checking it twice;
Gonna find out Who's naughty and nice.
Noah the Bitch is coming to town
ah fuck off
so much self control
:/
do you see how much I'm holding myself back
monstrous you could say
in some ways yes
but you're undeniably a monster damnit
no
would you rather the suffering continue
you fucking monster
I guess we'll call this an armistice for now
nice
those were some fucking great deals
i bought 4 games yesterday cuz of the nintendo eshop sale
i really don't mean that
jk
laughs in video games
oh boy! i love needlessly wasting money!
auction?
how bout you dontttttt
noah
should I auction this stuff off with Cindy being the only bidder
yeah
`rip` -salina, all the time
rip
i can win a war against myself ayyy
doesn't mean i can't shank your sorry ass tho
yeah you prob will
I'm sorry but I think I'll win this war
make up what lost ground, bitch?
**YAHYEEEET**
Salina's trying to make up lost ground
*yeet*
`rebellion against convention`
and my love of formatting
``drama``
`dramatic effect`
david just one upped us
`bc we hate each other`
me
```css
What's up with all the block text?
```
`i do wish`
Salina forgets a lot of stuff she says
i still have no idea what's happening but ok love y'all
`you wish bitch`
`that never happened`
`lol`
`shit`
who said this 5 mins ago
`one of my favorite people on here`
`nope i hate this bitch`
`just a lot of laundry to air`
you made me
`no you dont`
`you don't have as many shitty quotes`
`noah i really hate u`
`ty`
`nice`
`GOT IT`
`wait no`
`dare`
`you`
`don't`
~this is, right?~
`...`
I mean I have the whole shallow conversation
`no`
nope
`don't tell me what to do`
***is this how you do it***
`and you can be an uppity ass`
want more
`this is only for quotes`
you can go eat shit noah
sigh
correction, I quote is only `meister`
ack still
smh
really not bad
ok that's
so ofc i was like fuck NO
`call me meister`
with what happened in the other chat earlier <@!340319804747415553>
and he was like
to be fair, i have worse stories that are terrible without context
IM TELLING YOU
especially
THIS NEEDS CONTEXT
lmfaooo
I love it
i hate you
AAAAAA
fuck
OH MY GOD
`I mean would you prefer daddy? ;p`
nope
because this shit needs CONTEXT
k basically context:
not
or just like
he said it was like the same thing so probably
omg just dm each other and get on the same page
smh
do it already
fuck just
am i right on that count, noah?
the german comes right after that quote
actually if i'm right about what he wants to post in here
pls
no
salina, we're already proud of you
plus would I even be one of salina's bffs if I didn't attempt to semi-publicly embarrass her
just fucking don't
but at the same time
just ask noah
she'd be p proud of me too
to be fair, im p good at making people uncomfortable myself
motherfucker
IT'S SHIT LIKE THIS THAT MAKES ME NEED TO KNOW
you?
Cindy you would be so proud of me if you only you knew
making people uncomfortable etc etc
yes I do
that's the point
that he does
noah makes everything sound super weird
20k messages, some shit happens
noahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
please, go on
oh?
agh
nice and long
it's a quality sticky note
noah don't you DARE
salina shoots two shots, noah shoots one?
OOOOOOF
NOPE EMBARRASSED AS HELL
you should know that I of all people will not judge
well, if you have her outgunned
blooooooooooooDY MURDER
she's being dramatic
she's not actually that embarassed
fucking bloody murder
I have a list of these
noah i will murder you
if they're that embarrassed, maybe leave them be
Salina I'm pretty sure I have you out gunned
agh
you've piqued my curiosity and now I need to know
hard disagree
honestly, this bickering is better than any tea you guys could spill
you miss nothing as much as you know nothing about spelling and grammar lol
blow for blow
and i miss no grammar errors bitch
some rhymes to go
Salina knows I miss nothing
true
this chat is whack
yea we all did
a l a s  a l a c k
I saw that
dont you dareeeeeeeee
NOAH
holy hell
Noah you're killing me over here
DONT YOU DARE
NOAH
oh my god
yeah spill already hoe
NOAH
her getting "wayyyy worse"
oh you'll love this then
as in I don't mind
I'm saying "not salina" as in I am delighted when she does make a dirty joke
no I'm not saying "not salina" as in "oh no"
you need to get to know Salina better
Cindy you're killing me over here
too late
I thought your "deep hole" shit was unintentional but now Im unsure
no not salina
wayyyy worse
it gets worse
noah i blame you for the corruption
I can't stop
ha
stop saying vaguely sexual shit omg
jk
there's a lotta things to take to the face
y'all cool?
so much shade getting thrown here
fucking take it to the face
i'm joking damnit
then stop trying to do it under my nose
you might be one of my fave people here but don't you fucking dare
dare
fucking
you
don't
noah
...
I must follow strike first if necessary
see I also just enjoy despoiling your innocence too much though
fuck
I'm sorry but `when big brother ISNT WATCHING` is going to force my hand
noah i blame you for everything
shit
ahahaha
why
oh my god cindy
just be perfect like me and no one will have anything to ever expose you for
idk how though
man I need to get my mind out of the gutter lmao
oh i'd expose noah in a heartbeat, but i don't feel like getting rekt
don't play MAD with me
wow
that's....
arguably less deep hole but still
when big brother ISNT WATCHING
you were willing like 2 secs ago
maybe one day
but
kidding
I don't
if you guys don't wanna share, i respect y'alls' privacy
r u d e
I'm going to be climbing out of my own
deal's off
damnit
no that's your hole to climb out of
and like not shitty context
hurry up
can you
i feel like a bad friend lol
at least give context
can you
I'm gotta just sit there and take it
i n t e r e s t
well if you say my half you force my hand
oh my god i hate you
fucking hell
deal?
i hate you
fuck
noooo
I'll give your half and you can give mine
care to oblige?
well noah
same thing Cindy
your deepest and darkest secrets
I'm more curious about the german tho
tell us everything about yourselves
everything
both
or both?
or the stupid german shit?
the blackmail?
🍵 💦
spill
like this?
you can't tease us like that and then not deliver
like I always say
wait excuse you
it's a standoff
you're in the underworld of blackmail and everyone's got a gun pointed at each other
noah has blackmail material
tl;dr
i am totally lost
but still a joke nonetheless
granted, one that needs context
touche
that quote you have is damning but it's also a complete joke
also you and your blackmail material can go fuck itself
don't put this in my lap
if noah want to spill it, sure
S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L  S P I L L

S P I L L  T H E  T E A
I have it on Ctrl V already
i can do the thing now that we're using this chat
oh wait
i'm curious
should not be said to the chat
you know what will happen
the only thing you've said in german, bitch
don't say it
bc
no clue why
6 what?
well Salina for some reason you don't seem to like me speaking in German
surprisingly low
6
rood
.... oh my god
or just use his brain for much
because while my time might be so valuable I need to watch movies at x2 speed his obviously has no value
what Salina means is "let force Noah to go Google translate things"
gonna rock that discussion assessment
great french
good job gene
i just didn't pronounce any of the letters
that was me speaking in 11/10 french
did you guys hear that?
....
and not pronouncing letters
it's the language of diplomacy
I wish I knew more french
and they say french has no influence around the world
i keep defaulting to francais damnit
no se hablar frances
je ne parle pas espagnol
besides, he knows that i jabber off in spanish
well easier to evade searches lol
awkward spanish isn't helping your case here
no me gusta esto
eres un idiota
hmph
or ...
hmmm
hmm
like every variation of hm
u suck
....
so should I start adding up all the repeats
i just spam this server so y'all never forget
i'm always here if y'all need to talk
or i will hunt you down and make sure you can't
lemme live, bitch
still less than 10% damnit noah
we're here if you ever need to talk
still looks pretty bad for you Salina
y'all don't need to cater to my excessive need of attention
also rip gene D:
bruh, it's not your fault
I have 8k
sorry if I don't always respond
you have 12k
*D A B S*
aw gene
also i have more messages than him so it's not a 10k split
im just super lonely
and he won't can it
oh
so that makes me like over 50% then, right?
I'm either super social or super antisocial there's no in between
no, me and noah have 20k total messages in dms
803 lol
no you have like 6k
salina said 10k tho
no
still under 10% lol
am i over 50% of the messages? lol
you're not wrong
oof
so can it, smartass lol
i am by far the most in need of approval of others
10k messages
well that's like
yeah
yea but you're at 704 on mine so stop feeling so good about it
but as you guys can see
yuppers
surprise
less than 10%
i feel like my list is p accurate tho
229 actually
me too tho
yes you can
i write in fragments
can I search how many times she's said "rip" in here
but true
oh ow
me included
wait hold up
oooh
exactly
this
like
talk
I know from experience Salina's messages don't count as much though
people
some
cuz
message counts can be accurate
emily at 2071
AYYYY
search by person
holy
do you check
gene at 6770
just takin' a guess
how
my take:
1. gene (rip)
2. cindy
3. salina
4. helen
5. noah
6. david
7. alan
8. emily
9. jiayi
10. jeesoo
11. katya
12. kenneth
13. sasha
14. zoe
should've been 2048
wait that's a thing
helen at 2047
cindy at 2781
noah at 2183
Salina has 3836 messages
kenneth doesn't speak much either
check message count
jiayi doesn't talk much either
jeesoo and katya have been quiet
she pops in every once in a while, but not for long
or Zoe
I haven't seen Sasha much in here
idk
so how would you guys rank who uses this server most to least?
say it too many times and i'll gladly throw in some c4 in a 2 for 1 dealio
sigh
I will bring up the 4c at every opportunity as you know, combined that with making fun of you and how could I resist
no, bringing in the c4, bitch
human race ceases to exist or experiences extreme catastrophe before we're ever able to create time travel
was it future Salina trying to bring me a 4c?
what were they trying to do?
i was completely unaware of this
but they try not to interrupt school
ye
didn't we get a bunch sophomore and junior year?
really? i just recall that one
Skyline seems to get a lot of bomb threats
to be fair, that happened at skyline a couple weeks back
ye
like someone writing it on a bathroom stall
wasn't it some dumb shit tho
it was like the 3-hour lockdown drill we had, but we were outside
shit got crazy that day
I've had worse days
eh getting out of school
and of course there was the bomb threat, which was fucking terrible
they weren't smart
oh noooo
and i think i recall seeing a used tampon lying around once on the ground
if they were smart they would just have a bowl you could take from
someone else stole a condom from health class that year too
also, i remember in eighth grade, someone brought a condom to school, kiemle let people work outside in the hall, and they fill it up in the bathroom like a water balloon
idk
i think the dude had two first names
o wait yeah I remember
but they got themselves caught
maybe expelled idk
someone got suspended for trying to sell
as opposed to fake drugs?
which one incident
no I am that dumb just not dumb in that particular way
but in hindsight, i wouldnt be surprised
except for that one incident lol
i never noticed it while at PLMS
true
people started doing actual drugs in middle school
<@!503787499605458954> I'm doubting the `even I'm not that dumb` currently
granted
cuz people were trying this in middle school lol
it's a good fucking thing that stuff isn't gonna get a kid high
yeah
sour
citric acid
'cause it's like
is even less appealing tbh
sour patch kids dust tho
I thought about it but then I was like no even I'm not that dumb
no I definitely also know at least 5 people who have done it
smarties dust is something i *chalk* up to one or two idiot outliers
I think I already explained this to you when I was talking a bit too much
<@!503787499605458954> no
dear lord
also smarties dust
i need two hands to count 'em
hell naw
like i thought it was one or two idiots
surprisingly I haven't tried that
lol
fair
i've seen way too many people try to snort sour patch kids dust in my life
it still can if you want it to
ok, for the record
in case anyone missed salina's joke
coca cola used to contain cocaine
other way around not so much
well I could see a coked out person trying sugar because they're stupid
laughs in coke drink
I could see someone mixing them up
exactly
can't she do both?
jk love you lol
then we blame her sweet tooth
well if we ever see cindy coked out
for the record
sugar is as addictive as cocaine
Well if we're going to speak generally, eating anything to stay alive will bring you closer to a drug-induced state as opposed to the opposite outcome, death
rip?
Y'all can't enough of me, yet I'm derailing all of your lives
you didn't choose the drug life, the drug life chose you
oh right marshmallow
Cuz I'm marshmallow
uh
I'm a drug
si?
Guys
there has been studies that suggest that sugar has a lot of parallels to drugs
this is going to be good
actually
Sugar isn't a drug
I mean look at sugar
but I actually don't think it would be
it is a drug regardless of regulation
If caffeine had more impact it would be regulated as a drug
I know some people that think they have are caffeine non responders from how little it affects them
yeah tbh I wish caffeine had more of an impact
<@!503787499605458954> caffeine does a similar thing to me as well, I just say it turns me into a zombie, no extra energy but I just stay up easier
that should be helpful for college <@!258094439636008971>
And I got like 2.5 hours of sleep the night before
Emily gave me a small piece of coffee chocolate the other day, and I felt energy rushing through my veins, and I was super bouncy the rest of class
I don't drink coffee because I know it's a bad idea considering how hyper I already am
I think it's less a built-up tolerance and more a "being ready to collapse at any given point"
like if I want to I can chug a black coffee and then nap immediately after
doesn't make me more energetic though
it helps me involuntarily pass out less
caffeine never really affected me
yea cause you and everyone else and JSA has built up a superhuman tolerance to caffeine
also 95% of the time coffee >>>>>>> tea
takes effort
oh 'cause they're v effective sore throat helpers but I don't like them enough to drink it all the time
Tea I'm having right now
I approve
are we talking about Tea in the-tea chat
Why only when sick?
hmm?
Why tho?
Sounds like a yummy combo
like yeah they do taste good but I don't make it unless I'm sick lol
cinnamon almond milk is also excellent
"My go-to stomachache cure is cocaine and this really cool nut"
"I'm intrigued"
*Makes Coca-Cola*
Lmao judging remedies based on how good they sound
Mmmm
That sounds so good
peppermint tea + honey is my favorite sore throat cure
Tea is always nice
i've resorted to the alan strategy and am drinking tea to calm down my stress
there's just so much stuff that has to be on there
takes a while to navigate though
it looks alright
I think the website is ok personally
the old format was pretty gross ngl
Given, I can't remember how it was before so I do not have a basis to compare the relative level of suckiness with
It's already been redesigned once and it still sucks
I hate issaquah connect so much
oh thank god
hennig sent out an email and like that had me shook
skyline's gonna redesign their website
i have some real hot tea for y'all:
ok guys
and do it over the course of a week or something
we can make a channel for it
like
and we don't know stats cuz like we already know who's competent at what
and it's just us deciding what to do
one person tells it d&d style
also, how would you guys feel about a simulated zombie apocalypse but like
some people technically
but like
i don't
i mean, some people play each others instruments without sterilizing
are you sucking on each others instruments?
you can only wash them off so well
i've dropped a lot of reeds and mouthpieces and water bottles over 4 years
it's technically not wrong
that description
but also
... with more spit
yes i know
brass players literally blow piled up spit out of their instrument
it's the reality of playing a wind instrument
transfer of saliva
cuz like
and a loottt of people in band are kinda missing
whut
....
uhhhhh
i've probably indirectly kissed everyone in band who doesn't play percussion just cuz of the band floor
i will judge floor licking as i see fit
lmao
fuck off noah
... rip
I won't tolerate this intolerance
or one of my reeds (which i usually just wash afterwards cuz i'm cheap and am not throwing away good reeds for nothing)
like sometimes my water bottle falls over
let the man lick the floor
pls don't say you're licking the floor
people drop their things on the floor all the time
don't judge Gene
...
i mean
you're prob fine
well you're not licking the floor
uh
cuz brass instruments have to empty out their instruments
but the band floor is literally coated in spit if you think about it
i dont
just don't eat others food
lowkey i could get fucked over pretty easily cuz band
wouldnt be surprised
so like
and people in skyline share food a lot
and then i heard a bunch of people asking each other if they have mono
and one of my friends has just been gone for a week
it's been a week since hoco
i mean
either that or people are getting around a bit too much
lmao
i'm asking cuz i'm considering throwing out that tub of ice cream you guys left at my place last week
zombie apocalypse
lol
it's transmitted via saliva i think
i forget tho
it's short for something
mono?
so have a lot of people in skyline just been coming down with mono recently?
should i move to a different channel
i put all our names in it
lmao
woah what
I would not have guessed that was  girl
just went on the site
http://brantsteele.net/hungergames/reaping.php
Hunger Games simulator?
the hunger games simulator is lame so i'm trying to make my own (hopefully less lame) version
I'm going to run the simulator right now
True
But we can do the hunger games anytime
Fine I concede
My idea b e t t e r
No
We should do that online hunger games thing
:o
Of sorts
Yes
I'll update y'all tho
Group activity?
I have to t h i n k
What type of idea?
Honestly, this is giving me an idea, but I have to think this through before I present it to the group
Awww
(except family but that's a different issue)
3wholesome5me
If a disaster ever actually happened though I would stick with this group because all my favorite people are here
That sounds like a great way to become a minion to be lorded over
My best chance of survival is if I can find some minions to lord over so I can hide
You would do pretty well on your own
Noah
Honestly
Do you tho?
JK I love y'all
No I just find Nicholas
<@193229269076279298> can survive the longest on his own
I would immediately become a deserter
I give this group a low to medium chance of survival
And Alan, I'm not sure that'd how it works
<@503787499605458954> I might be unaware and a little bit of a klutz and late to everything, but I'm otherwise pretty decent at being alive
I would become a zombie with the express purpose of turning you into a zombie <@258094439636008971>
not to be rude
tbh my bets would be on you dying first
if we were stuck together in a zombie apocalypse, how would it go down, and why is <@!478706068223164416> the first one to die?
and not our call to make (it's cindy and everyone else)
can this move to <#505651675705507841>
yeah, a hashtag is kinda small atm
let’s not worry about the small details rn
<@!503787499605458954> will handle things like this i think. she’ll talk to the juniors and keep us posted
if not, sure
if theirs already has traction, run with it
depends
ours has more zing
can we have the juniors change thwir hashtag to ours
thanks
<@!460689096646590465> 
-some juniors are doing something similar, we brought up Matthew again
-open this up for parents as well
-helen outlined some priorities, especially getting a lot of people in on this
-i can get in touch with the SAGE club president (she's a friend of mine)
tldr**
tdlr pls
#nomore i think? i don't have insta tho so lowkey rip
What's the hashtag?
i think our hashtag aas better
Mmk
So like it's a valid point to bring ip, just would be best if they focused on that in context
The thing is the sexual assault issue is directly tied to the prioritization of sports
^
I think it would be useful; even if they are just talking about the sexual assault issue they would be a compelling voice
It could be pretty powerful
Well yeah
I think if we make sure they’re informed
Pulling them in for the sake of pulling them in could be an oof
Clout
I think opening it for parents to participate would help
Well let me clarify
I disagree
Pulling in parents could be detrimental bc they’re gonna want to say stuff that isn’t necessarily relevant to the sexual assault issue at hand
I think we need to stay focused
Obviously not a walk out but they might write something
Should we try to get them to also contribute at the same time?
Also, my mom and other parents have complaints about how skyline event's are run, especially their emphasis on sports and negligence for actual academically useful stuff.
I'd recommend something more specific to what we are trying to accomplish, if possible
Time for change is a very vague name
Eli gave me control over the insta so we can do whatever
Kk
Tag with both
We could combine
Or do we keep no more
Do we want to do time for change then
Okay awesome
And I'm good at posters too I can help when I get home
The posters you guys have look fantastic btw
I'm gonna talk to Matthew and then maybe work on making a new group chat for everyone who wants to help
A bunch of juniors also want to collaborate with us on organizing a protest/walkout type thing! They made an instagram and email and shit already
I didn't have the time to read through everything BUT
Hey guys
anysyas im goinf to sleep
over throw people@who do coverups
but broader goal is to stop these coverups
overthrow current admin like donna
look we can't get rid of admin
guysss talk@about@revolution in the revolution channel
overthrow admin
According to 5 seconds of Googling
Revolution implies overthrowing a ruling body
i want to@call it a revolution because it sounds mode extreme
I'm smart
google
Genuine question
To clarify, what's the difference between a movement and a revolution?
L
i'll miss the irony
we have made a revolution
Boston Tea Party!
and tea is@for tea
the tea is scalding
the revolution will be goijg on more
but the Tea
the revolution
hm?
I MADE A TAG FOR@THIS
guys
ALSO
the @ symbol is too close to@space
bc we're tired and nothing really makes sense when we're tired
do it in the morning
I have to be at the bio thing tomorrow morning
yeah im on my phone
okay maybe not rn
i have jsa
ooof
and we@post it on insta rn
we need to coordinate it tho
guys i have work in like 8 hours
so there's info
we do an hashtag dump
or cough today
jesus katya are you on your phone
tomorrow
and tell@people to@go@ok it and@pass it to fheir friends
or we@pass it out and the back has an information link
agreed
i think we post that when we have gained traction
looks great emily
ooo i like that
or something
thanks its b a s i c
a breaking rope
do we want to do like
OOO THATA REALLY GOOD
i need a symbol or smth
I'd have to see it first, but I'd be willing to give it a try
maybe we xan redraw so it looks more nuetral
i think the lips work
its provocative
i think the lips@would@be good
hmm
Magnifying glass?
true
ppl aren't gonna get it
victim
too subtle
With year numbers on the file?
becsusd its anout admin not victem
maybe breakinf a file seal
but yeah def workable
kinda similar to what i posted earlier
rip
In the men's restroom, about 3 guys go into stalls each month
We Unite
we shoild also@hand them put and have people@pass it@on to theur friend
yeah its fine
yeah they wont insidd fhe stalls
Also, janitors clean those things like every day
how hard can they monitor bathrooms lol
Especially with the bomb threat last week
wdyn
They're gonna moniter bathrooms super hard
We refuse
Just a heads-up
we shoukd put posters inside bathroom stalls
We inform
Or just we create
*we create change
We diverge
We evolve
Wait
We change
We support
Oh, well then go for it
we protect
i liked we know
we defend
we defy
Actually not that last one
We know
We listen
We hear
we support
we fight
we protest
We believe
we act is good
We unite
we act
Why do you need so many?
we respect
we stand
like "we speak" or "we unite"
im running out of we phrases
What's up?
hmm Emily?
i need help
Very careful
assertive, but cautious
and facts on the poster
Very
rn we need to be careful
but also a bit lowkey
with a bitly link ag the bottom
it needs to be provocative
we make a provocative poster
true
i think we need to bit.ly this shit
of the thing
we xan airdrop screenshots
then even less ppl are gonna scan it
Skyline's not gonna tell them, so it's gonna fall on us
hmmm
and if we're airdropping this shit
then we make protesting poster
ppl don't usually look at qr codes
with qr codes to more information
thafs why we make informational posfsrs first
why woild they be mad if fhey dont know what happened
Exactly
a lot of people dont know@what happened
And how admin responded
so we can't get smote by lightning
Let people know that this happened
we need some kind of visibility
At least get the student body around us
something to give us a bit of leverage against admin
we need momentum first
Yeah
too much too early imo
provoking at first
what if we@do something like this
Emi, i might try drafting a flower imagery one later on
I'd rather not drag the designer into this, let them do their job and get out
GDD Club has a shit ton of artists
but he's very under the radar these days from what i can tell
I could also get in touch with a lot of people in GDD Club
Park maybe
we could talk to Abhay
I know a couple people?
i just draw
nope
dose anyone here do graphic design?
i think ripping somsthing off would be good
Muted microphone symbol or maxed out one?
its lowkey kinda basic
we need imagery a five yearold can understand
yes
volume symbol
we need hella traction before we use microphone
Why did they try to take down a meme page?
i love gatsby too
and i don't think everyone will totally get it
i love gatsby lol
tbh... it's too gatsby
of like hands are tied
if yall don't like my daisy idea please just shoot it down now
do we want to maybe play off the idea
theyll try to shut us down
Really?
admin tried to take down a meme lage that was operated outside of school
too obvious to admin
This might be in the complete opposite direction, but what about a microphone?
unless they know it
#NoMore excuses
people wont understand floral symbolism
usuallu silenxd js associated with victims
no excuses is the same as covering up
right for this
just not
not very
coverups is a very informal word
its ok
no coverups, no excuses #nomore
i don't mean for it to come off that way
rip
because no silence is kindof attacking the victims for being silent
silence is ignorance
not no silence
i stand by my floral symbolism
rape is rape
stop excusing rape
No silence, no excuses, #NoMore
what do we want the poster to say
i agree with emily
yeah
i would be super weirded out if i got airdropped evidence from a case
yeah
i think we should just start with a poster
and we can do airdrop for information
its to provoke people and to spark questions
true
the poster is for awareness
its possible
thats too much information
we can't inform using a poster
trying to target someone like that so early could fuck us over
i think first we hvae to inform and then spread the poster bevaud a lot of people dont even knos about the case
we can't target people like that
i think we need to be careful about namecalling
lets not focus on donna
andthe evidence is on the borders
and shit like that
like donna
i was thinking of a visual with evidencd of the coveruo
or #nomore
maybe like someone ripoing something off and under it it says no means no
like maybe slightly different if we don't want to skew toward a certain gender
do we want to try something like this?
the stopping of covering up?
whar is the focus of our movement
hmmm
yeah idk emi
i made a special thread for this
but i don't like how its just a woman
guys
i was gonna do smth like that
and we could play with it/stylize
i did find this tho
ah
daisies represent innocence
bc sexual assault is generally associated with a hand put out
violets represent faith
floral symbolism
we could try to do something with hands
idk
a whistle?
what represents the movement
i need a symbol
I don't even have to graduate from skyline at this point so I could care less what they think
move all revolutionary activity to the revolution
because repostabld things spread fast
i only find data on board meetings
and it spreads
we post it on insta with the hashtag
idk
we need to start with canva
Serious question, but how do ISD meetings work?
if we have to, we canvas
yes
we can do community town halls
when's the next isd meeting or whatever
town halls and shit
how donwe parkland
mine just can't be taken seriously lmao
i'll change my insta name too
on soam and main
yeah
we all need to make coordinated posts
😄
yeah no morenis so god
mmmk
gets confusing
but i think #NoMore is quite powerful
too many just kinda
let's just use one hashtag
to coveruos we say #NoMore
idk
To victims, we say #NoSilence. As students, #WeSpeak
To skyline we say #NoMore. To admin we say #NoMore.
we need to parkland this shit
yes
I'm down for whatever, cuz I don't have Instagram so rip
jkjkjk
#nomore
(pls credit)
loke brock turner
#NoMore
no more getting off light
#NoMore
it relates to no more coverips
because
lol
i think no mode is good
i'm just bouncing sports puns tho
for us, it applies to sports. for others its something else
no
it doesn't
no more is good
Why does it have to be tied to sports?
#CryFoul
like #nomore is good
assault
you know what i mean
i think something tied to sports and assualy
well yeah but that's already a thing
metoo is the broadest
How do we get more people in on this?
yeah i know
past skyline
past football past ISD
i think we should broaden it
#JusticeOverJerseys
It wasn't in great taste
its fine
Sorry about that
let's be serious right now
ok thats true
and tastefully
if done rightt
right now it makes a joke out of the movement
its like satire
That wasn't really the brightest move on my part
i think memes have a powerful way of sopreading information
this is serious stuff that genuinely affect lives
#ActionOverExcuses
Sorry
OKAY NO MEMES GUYS
they're just not doing it
they're listening
SASHA AHOULD MAKE AN ISD MEME THAT SHOULD SPREAD
?
#ListenToUs
gene this is serious
#TheEnd
gene no
#dewit (kids like memes, right?)
OOO
#Enough
but nomore means that they dont donit no more
#WeListen
trye
And transparency
Cuz it's about them acknowledging this shit
nocoverups
i like no more
The no silence thing is pretty good
i think no more is good
#NoSilence
#WeSpeak
#NoMore
bscause it happens alot
poll it?
no more is good
i think no more is good
me too is an extension
#metoo
I think any hashtag/slogan should be more community-driven rather than focusing hate at ISD
yes thats good
#nomore
Oh
#SpartansActuallyUnited
#sparansunitsagainsisd
Guys
I don't hashtag well
it's too long
yeah
something short and snappy
i think kindness without conditions is a good slogan but not a good hashtag
In band
or #hateshouldnothaveahomehere
Cuz that's what we have to call "Fireball" now
i'm your gal
if anyone needs puns/clever wording
Holy shit I never wanna hear "Mr. Worldwide" again
XD
nobody touches matthew bellevia and his agenda without getting through us
its hella salt
ooo kindness without confitions is gooood
well we'll back him up
mr. worldwide but skyline version
but he's still getting shut down too
big dick energy
Big power
yeah that was cindy
Matthew is like
yes
true
Also, someone (Cindy?) showed screenshots of talking with Matthew earlier
its about what the message is and as long as the message gets to everybody then we've done our job
it isn't about who made the posters
i don't need credits
who cares
#kindnesswithoutconditions
but they dont make it
like they spread the poster
Shouldn't this be super grassroots tho? The whole point is that it's students' voices
the point is to get people on this
why not katya
im kidding
No
i honestly dont want a lot of people in on this
damnit emily
Uh
Also not bad
#fightapathy 😛
#nosilence
That's not bad
#wespeak
ok true
no
like #firedonna
if colleges can't face this, they don't deserve us
if it keeps me from college, actually fuck it
What can they really do?
if they expose me, fuck it
Someone said "this isn't us" earlier, and that wasn't too bad
lmao they can expose me idc
we dont want to be exposed
but still do it
ok lets make this a small geoup effort
i was thinking #FuckISD but let's not do that
how bout not cas project
yeah
start a hashtag or smth. something that will catch on bc its easier than like. writing a full on paragraph or something
Cw would murder us for using this as a CAS project regardless of what his stance is
okay well let's all make our posters
this is a group project
jk
drawing is an activity 😛
CAS project
creative and service?
but uh
not to be that kid
hey is this CAS
so that i can really fuck with the fonting
you can do that
Beyond just our hoco group?
i wanted to draw up a poster like on my tablet
Can we get more people in on this?
canva.com
its a poster designing website
we need to make multople posttees
canva is The Shit
Canva?
SAME
lolllll emily
canva is so good
i don't use it much but it's awesome
got me a 92 on my G4
canva is great
life saver
i use a site called canva
idk
#breakthesilence
let's all make posters
should be only do 1 poster?
start a hashtag?
whats gonna be on the poster
rip everything
rip sptv
okay but yeah
ok this isn't the point
we airdrop and posters
it's like overcompensating
also one of their current events is a fucking statistic bitch do ur research
anywyas
like wtf i trusted him
and their music is too dramatic
Andreas didnt do it justice
their audio isn't even balanced
TRUE
im Bitter
fucking sucks
their replacement of your segment
also
Alex
damnit emi
man why did i quit SPTV that's like a whole power source
My freshman friend is pissed cuz his sister was friends with the victim
that's why we make illegal posters
i want to make some goddamn inflammatory posters
juniors dont know
I was just apologizing to some underclassmen in band today about leaving behind a shitshow if we can't fix this
becausd lots of underclassmen dont know about it
angry
idk man but the seniors sure are agry
we need to airdrop digital versions of the poster
^^^^ emily
Including underclassmen
my job as a student isn't to selfishly get good grades and get into a good college just for my own wellbeing in the future. im not gonna leave this shithole of a school for other people to suffer in
How many people in Skyline would you guys say are aware of this?
We're not just the leaders of the next generation at this point. This is gonna affect years of Skyline culture to come
like us? or the school? or just society?
about everything
then what does this say
fuck my education doesn't mean shit if it doesn't serve well for other people
if this just fizzles out
bc goddamnit this is so damn important
we're all leaders of the next generation and if we don't pave a fucking road over this gravel shit we're just leaving this mess for the next people in line
i will put aside fucking college apps and hw for this
*t-poses* guys I'm in charge now
i woll give inspirational communist speech
jinx
because FUCK THIS SHIT
we all lead
we all lead
i will lead
plato's cave
coup detat
love love love this
is literally going militant
i like how our hoco group
like whos really afraid of admin. they can't stop us
Basketball analogy
we need to parkland this shit
listen guys the ball is in our court. we have the upperhand
now or never
watch them do that in 20 days when it dies down
Honestly, let's just do an FOA-style presentation on this shit to them connecting this to metoo
we need to parkland this shit
they can flip
statement
but legally they havs 20 days to put put a statember
people are clearly angry and if we, as a school, start something to protest against this shit people will join us
and yet my disappointment is fucking immeasurable at this point
yet theyre denying
we have low standards
theres so mych evidence
you have one job
school
yes
like damnit
This is just getting worse and worse
it should
Honestly
reading more on this is really pissing me off
a pink one
lol emily
At least we have a starburst
here's straight up black tea
no sugar for you
tea with a side of redacted
inference!
Yeah
everything is blocked out so you kind of have to piece together the subjects
he did he just needs clarification
I read the emails. I was confused
and news
that's what katya's trying to say
gene read the emails
field
feild
donna was going to arrest the mom if she took her daughter off the feriks
they told her she had a duty to get on the box and cheer like nothing happened bc she's a cheerleader and that's her job
football is done
sports are about to end this season either wa
That shit's $4,000
then they were like "what can we do?" and its like y o u kn o w  y o u h ad ur sh ot
ppl are saying sports should be stopped at our school
Wait, forced into cheer?
also
that's not fun
... yeah
its our tax money
she was basically forced to cheer when they should've stopped everything and helped her
no shit sherlock
you know when the get sued
That's unsettling
Holy shit
Dipshit was a dipshit
ye
And then later
and then the coach was also a bitch to her
ooh right
Well, still, the people there
at the game
there was harrsment of the sister of the victem
😮
it's not at the game
yeah that's what i thought
no there wasnt rape at the fame
also he was primarily a football couch that year, he only started teaching the very end of 2015/ beginning of 2016
that's kind of unclear
was the rape at a game?
Oh my gosh
Dude, so I could've literally been at a football game where there was rape?
wdym its all feom the same one
okay i need to read the whole ass statement and construct a timeline
it's one main lawsuit
rn? i don't think so
dude i need to jump back on my insta at this point
are the documents from different rape cases
it's described in a later sc
i like hate has no home here
<@460689096646590465> I thought it was in 2014?
and like "where's your fucking kindness now"
it was probably the game
it's like radio silence
I'm pretty sure I already know what his reason will be though
but when ppl fucking need that kindness
What were the emails about? It sounded about a specific thing happened on "Saturday"
how our school is all "culture of kindness"
i like
Shit
her sister got hella bullied
And he will defiantly have a reason to back it up, it's our choice to decide if we think it is right
Oh
What's a Mesh
the rape victim's sister was in cheer
mesh is in charge of cheer
Noah, you're right there, and that bothers me
Or is it a different thing altogether?
Myers is harder than even I am when it comes to stances on things, so if he held it then there is a good chance he holds it now
Cuz 2016 is like two years later
Also, can I get context for the emails? Was that about the same person?
unfortunately no
we don't get to pick teachers
well...
gross
I need to know where the law suit was in relation as well and how much of it was public
That's fucking scary
Really?! I had him the next year
end of freshman year for us
2015 i bet
based on the format of twitter
But still
that really sets up the context
teachers will take them down but we'll just keep putting them back up
That's true
I need to know the date of Myer's tweet
ASB students would probably support us
iF tTeY'rE nOt ApPrOvEd By AsB tTeY'reE iLlEgAl, oh fuck asb they aren't going to do shit but take them down
Wait, were those emails about the same person or someone else altogether?
yeah u need approval to hang them
they're illegal
if they're not approved by asb
the thing cindy sent
Also, posters aren't illegal I don't think
Wait, what email shit?
also count me in on illegal posters and protests and shit
even as a joke that's fucking insensitive... and if it's serious, wtf
what the hell is that tweet
geez
that email shit.....
all of tbis shit goes deep
I need to talk to Myers
Granted, they're separate people, but Myers is officially a piece of shit
I had a degree of respect for them prior to seeing that tweet
i heard a lotnof shit about mcgoorty meyers
damn
I think she got a decent grade tho. I might be misremembering that tho
No
did she end up presenting
Which by all means should've been fine
Oh, and Makenna's presentation wasn't particularly edgy. It was just "here's an allegory. Trump bad."
Cuz she just kinda hated everyone in my group except me
McGoorty called our group for a presentation and kinda just said "alright, it's time for Gene and... Gene's group"
but you know thats me i guess 😃
which i think is wrong
mcgoorty wouldn't let kenna do her presentation bc it was politically provocative
It's interesting nonetheless
Of varying validity
Makenna has tea on everyone
😮
McGoorty is probably pissed at him if they're still teaching together
makenna page has some Tea on mcgoorty
3/4 mcgoorty block
yeah
<@!278660908212027392>  can i join you on the illegal posters
oof
I'm really deeply disturbed
I had him as a teacher for a year
we don't stan a rapist sympathizer
That son of a bitch
bet he deleted this
Really?
Wait holy shit
^^^
first two are assaulters
the last one is victem
I can't tell
Which names in the tweet are the victims and which names are the dipshits?
i think
ye
So the giver of the infamous command terms quiz?
not it
this is
There's so much stuff scribbled out that I can't even tell what he's saying
THE Zachary Myers
skyline has some really bomb ass teachers
the teacher
A student?
Or like
Wait, the teacher?
zack
or zac
zak meyers
yeah
Wait, is that Myers?
yooooooooo
ooo fuck
(the fact that we're silenced gives us the motive to speak up just saying)
nop
what was it
agreed gene
we're not just high schoolers we also have this underlying responsibility to serve the future. we're silenced because people think we're too young or immature to know but that's far from the truth. at school, we have the support of the teachers, even if they don't say so. we just need to act
did you see meyers tweet
Actually, youth is often silenced a lot of the time. Although I personally think that needs to change, so you're right
don't get the teachers involved. the power lies in the students. it always has been like this. i mean look in your textbooks. who are the leaders of change? its the youth
Although then again
Although I remember a lot of teachers were pretty supportive of the walkout sometime last year (granted, very different circumstances and probably smaller scale)
That's true
not get another one potentially
we're not here to get people who are on our side fired
lose their job
I suppose that's too much to ask
they will get fired
True
they'll get in trouble
But like
Idk if that makes a difference
Can we get any teachers in on this anyhow?
bc they don't want that for me either
okay the point is i won't shut up if a teacher tells me to
Ew
But still
At least IB isn't CollegeBoard
anyway
y are test so expensive ;-;
^^^^^
ha "non profit organization" my ass please tell me why im paying $600 for a couple sheets of paper and a score
comes back to this situation. honestly screw that our teachers tell us not to say anything about this because we're not supposed to. they're only telling us this because they don't want to get into trouble with the district
ib makes big money
but ofc they have to do it bc of ISD
yo skyline teachers Hate that they have no control and that they have to follow what the district wants. our teachers don't even like IB Diploma. they don't think it makes sense. in paananen's words, three year classes don't make sense and Don't Work
What did he say?
Ooooo
Honestly, I think this needs more awareness too. Some people at Skyline still don't know any this
i was talking to paananen for my interview and we were discussing the worst parts about teaching
*true
Yrhet
Then again, they also kinda just hate band in general
o-o
the teachers care about us. i strongly believe that skyline admin care about the wellbeing of their students. its comes down to the district. the district doesn't care about us. the district just wants to look pretty so they get money
Yeah lmao
lmaoooo their priorities
It's funny how Skyline doesn't let the band say the word "fireball" during one of our songs but just lets sexual assault happen with minimal action taken
they can't expel us while saving face. in fact if they do anything wrong to us, they''ll be shooting themselves in the foot because they're the same people who encourage us to stand up and speak up
Paananen would be proud
Yeah, true
yo civil disobedience is a thing
If we get expelled
Take 'em to court?
:/
no guarentee of being expelled
that means they dont care about their own rules
they didnt follow their athletic rules
Let's not
honestly lets do that
we are allowed to express opinions
Yeah, if you check their policy, they're not gonna expel us unless we protest by doing cocaine or some shit
stuff
remeber that vietnam black armbands
they cant expell us
We have rights as individuals to protest
im not scared
I mean
i’m not scared of them
F l e x
lmao what are they gonna do expel all of us
Bacteria is gonna grow all yuck
sweeping things under the rug doesn’t clean up the mess 😇
Being seniors and all
i only knee slight rumors
We have the resources to actually do something too
yeah it gets covered ip
so obviously admin knew it was happening too
because pur district thinks ignoring rape is fine
see people knew that these things were happening
and this is why we need to rise up
Yesss
cindy went off
im gonna send a thing cindy posted on her story
shows there are consequences
need a clean slate
but i think firing is a good first step
thats true
I'm not sure what to expect them to do right now tbh, but I'm scared that they might try to do this again in the future
they can’t keep apologizing and firing people every time this happens. they need to take action to prevent this from happening over and over again
ayush and i are going to make posters and illigallh hamg them up around the school
so it saves some face
That's true
bevause it makes it look like they are taking action
“oh sorry we messed up” doesn’t serve these rape victims justice
the people who got the least backlash admitted that they did something wrong and fired the wrong doers
yeah no shit but what are they gonna do to fix it
they don’t wanna lose face. if they look bad they’ll lose students. lose status. lose money. that’s more valuable to them than students no matter what they say no matter what the teachers want
ISD officially stated that they don't feel like they handled it wrong
the people who stayed quiet about it and tried to let it blow over got the most backlash
loke
or the papa johns case
ok so has isd not learned anything from any of the past metoo cases?
being pissed about the school system is a power move
*yall
Just felt like pointing that out lmao tall are awesome
that’s the Real Tea
Only vaguely related but I like how our gossip channel has become like a serious discourse/activism thing
also evon works on the same board as donna hood but i haven’t asked him about it yet. i’m like 50% sure he’s gonna say the same thing i’m saying about how skyline admin can’t do anything about it bc the district is trying to save face and deal with it without costing them much
like i don’t want the district telling us “we’re not allowed to talk about it” and i don’t want to listen to them because that’s exactly how we got here in the first place
skyline admin has to follow what the district tells them to do. they hate that their hands are tied but honestly fuck that?
Idk who Coach Jordan is maybe they left in the past 2 years??
For clarification I'm pretty sure Mesh wasn't the one who forced her to keep going, it made it sound like she wasn't there
the emails... bruh skyline
id be down
yesss
thanks for the updates cindy
this id be down for
He said he'd keep me in the loop + if any of yall are interested in helping
I kinda went off in my insta story lmao and Matthew reached out and we had a really nice conversation
Another update
“is there something we can do” yeah there was but uh you failed to act properly at the right time so
so thats why she got super red when some football players asked her about the situation
i feel like she's trying her best but like... damn
geez mesh
damn
Update on the rape case.... emails provided to a news source regarding harassment to the younger sister at a game, who was reportedly forced to cheer for skyline even though one of the rapists was there and taunting her
i’m on my break i just bought 20$ worth of stuff for $6
rip
okay
which is at 9
my manager asked me to stay until closing
dman n
ye sptv
This "work time" is too loud to listen to music >.<
holy shit did y’all watch sptv
not surprised. makes sense
bitch they better not................
ISD statement as of right now
and thats what caused the entire investigation
i heard someone crashed into a tree on the student lot
that you can run into
what trees are there on skyline property?
exactly
yeah
what tree?
remember when we were coming back from lunch
because i heard someone crashed into a tree
wait is the bomb threat why they shut the stairs down or is becaus e of a car crash
i still have no idea how the hell i went over 3 years without realizing any of this
see yall at school safe tomorrown
^
i wuv u2
well im glad this has been brought to your attention gene
a lot of this is super new to me, and i just want everyone to be safe. you guys are too good of friends, and idk what i'd do if something were to happen to someone.
hey, guys, whatever happens, for the rest of the year, i just wanna say i love you guys and i hope everyone's safe by the time we graduate and through the rest of the year. y'all are great people, and while i'm still trying to process the rape, harassment, and bomb threats going on, i just wanna say that i hope no one here ever has to experience something like that. if y'all ever need to reach out to someone because you're concerned about your safety, please do. someone's gonna be there for you. at the very least i will.
and cold ;-;
im alive but not kicking
ye watup
@ ken
they're gonna break shit
Your house will be a pile of cinders
it was supposed to be rhetorical
Have 60 ppl over
its just a matter of how much u trash the place
You just clean it up later to best of ur ability
you totally do
i'm worried now
You dont not trash it
u dont
that's too many people
how do you not trash the place
spooky
yike
Right its halloween
ye that one !
oooh
Ohhhhhh
oh the halloween party
not gonna help him
you would think the rest of them would have learned tho?
Where the fuck
uhhh emma
im not going to be talking to karan in class
lol nope
who the fuck is hosting 60 people
hooefully karan isnt invited
how dumb are people
ye
<@!105508293522264064> really?
damn
again, idc who's getting punished more than who, but both male and female rapists don't get punished enough as a whole
basically treating them as equal and removing the stigmatization around both helps both sides
with 60
theres another one this saturday
male rape is valid too and needs to be spoken about more
and also yes
^^
dang
^
like 40 plus
like male rape is even less talked about than female rape because it is so stigmatized, yet we should treat them equally but to be able to do that we need to bring more awareness to female rape because thats whats most prominent
how many people were at the part exactly? i know the answer earlier was "a lot," but does anyone have a numeric estimate?
if thats what you're getting at
so like......... a shit ton of people
enough people
everyone
probably everyone at that party + a lot of the friends of people who went
i mean, i guess we do
Who knows about Karan
toxic masculinity bad
rape bad
everything bad
But unfortunately that's the reality
so I can see where Katya's coming from
Shouldnt be
there's this whole macho thing where men are expected to always want sex that's presented to them? like if a guy says a girl forced him to have sex w her he'd be humiliated, emasculated, etc, people would be like "wtf man she was aggressively offering to have sex w you and you didn't want it? wtf is wrong w you" etc
male victems dont get taken as seriously
It's also just like a general social assumption
its length of sentances
i'm just regurgitating internet at this point
i don't really know tho
😮
i've seen the point made that men get punished more but haven't checked it out. i think the basis stems from the length of sentences. i'm not sure how valid this is, but i think that's where they're going
Yes
(probably shouldn't be thinking about it like this but does this count as TOK extensions)
rapists of both genders get away with a shit ton
katya your statement is particularly subjective and hard to measure. i really can't agree or disagree with statements that can't really be verified if that makes sense
female rapists who rape men can get away with a lot more bc of societal expectations of guys
its derived from how male victems are treated
hot taek: neither gender gets punished enough for rape
the original statement sounded p bad BUT when it comes down to male vs. female rapists
im saying what is actually done
Yeah I mean what should be done and what is actually done are 2 disctinct things someyomes
TO BE CLEAR im not saying men SHOULD be more punished
ok I can agree w that actually
thats a very overgeneralized statement
any cases
look at past cases
sources
how do you know
whos to say that
thats what i meant
like if a woman is a rapist and a man is a rapist the man will be more punshid
okay nvm lets talk
uh katya what
i will debate that but uh i won't right now
Wait what
they get punished for being raped or for raping
mmmmmmm
I just wanna say poor hennig
in both situations tho men get punished more then women
Admin is all shitting themselves rn
yeah
rape happens to men too i want to make that clear
No shit especially with this recent lawsuit
rape is a touchy subject
everyone is underage and participating in VERY ILLEGAL shit
everyone gets backlash for rocking the boat
anyone gets backlash for speaking up about rape
well ok in this situation
men do get a lot of backlash too
Badly
They get harassed for speaking up
it's not unique to woman
This recent skyline lawsuit proves exact point
ok true
that would still be letting karan get away with it
with teachers
i mean we can talk about the rape case not the karan case
because they get punished too for some fucking reason
this is Also why women don't fucking speak up
well no one that wants to stay a teacher
as much as i don't want karan to walk away thinking this is okay...pretend you're one of the girls. you were at a party in seattle. you were getting high. drinking underaged. doing all the shit you're not supposed to do. then a guy sexually harasses you. you think about your options. you know you should go and say something to an adult because what he did was wrong and he shouldn't get away with it. but you think about the consequences. by saying that happened you'd be admitting you were at a party with alcohol and drugs. you'd be exposing yourself. your friends. everyone. people would probably hate you.
can you imagine the layers of inappropriate
maners specifically said she doesnt wanna know what went down last weekend
jesus christ there's no fucking way teachers are gonna touch this with a 10 foot pole
because we will be talking about it not her
loll we should bring it up
i suppose it's a personal decision
tbd
smited
Do you think maners will talk about this in tok or will she get smited for that
that's true
we don't know, but why do you have the right to speak for them if they choose to stay silent
i have no idea what's gonna happen
idk
will they?
well its not rumors but second hand info
welllllllll
Yeah that's true if they want to tell theyll come forward about it
its not like we were there
I doubt any of the people who were would be thrilled about any of us jumping in
and this is all rumors
its their story, they should be in control
none of us were there
were not sweeping under the rug
<@!258094439636008971>  but the thing is
gene,,,we'd be risking our friends
yes sir
wait, three?!
perhaps not a good thing to do
-_-
-____
Terrivle idea
Go big or go home I guess
bad idea
when people go ham bc they're at their first party
And he tried to assault 3 girld???
honestly, didn't we just agree that we should be more proactive about stuff that gets swept under the rug like this less than 30 minutes ago?
and he fkd it uo
well
loll
that was the first party he was invited to
litty
its snack day matheny p3
happy friday
happy friday the world is full of shit
why was he invited tbh
Oh happy friday
i dont trust skyling with anything
Like who is gonna risk their own ass
the people at the party
so basically nobody is allowed to talk to karan anymore
but like
Rhey would never
not karan of course
we could tell them that maybe they should consider talking to admins about it?
oh my god
we just shouldn't do anything out of the interest of our other friends who are more  closely involved
he also tried to have sex with two other girls at the party
as much as I hate this too
up to them
damnnN karan
they monitor cyberbullying through edgy memes being not allowd only if posted during school hours
i forgot
and it's really, really not our place to do shit
oh ya
woah
I don't trust skyline not to fuck everything more tbh
Hard pass
Y I k e s
its upto her to do anything about it
he tried to pressure her into going into a room and into his car to "listen to music" but she wouldn't go. eventually she just closed the door on him and locked him in a room
we cant come forward with her story for her
so i imagine they can do something about this
skyline claims to monitor cyberbullying right? that's technically not school
yeah but pressing charges is up to christina
i didnt hear about the bedroom thing
are def a crime
or that
oh
well
didn't you hear about the bedroom thing
the pictures
sexual assault?
true
sexual harrassment
then we can't do anything i guess
you cant press charges for a grope right?
thats most of the info i got
That's ul to christina
no
uh
also, katya's right
but some of the girls forgived karan
how many?
no one is currently pressing charges
i dont need names
numbers
we weren't involved at all
ok skyline cant do anything about people drinking or doing weed unless they do it at school
Yeah we would expose all the underage drinkers there
huge
that's not up to us
alot of them are pissed
how big was this party?
yeah no
they don't want to get in trouble either
we would be exposing hella people
what do people at the party think of this
but some people might be able to get away with slaps on the wrist?
That's less ok than I thought tho
he always gave me those vibes
but we'd be exposing people
i'm not sure what everyone else at the party did
Can we please let someone know about this
not
well now we cnat just
i imagine if we reported, karan would by far get the most serious punishments
Why is he like thisb
he really fucked up
but he fkd up hellla
thats more than annoying thats a fucked up move
Why would you photograph that
hes a disgusting human being
i wont say names for privacy reasons
hes really annoying
......
ya
thats fucking disgusting
scamming weed
was taking pictures of two peeps when one told him to stop
hold up what
oh yeah i heard
holy FUCK
U hh man
HUH?
i love the friends who went to that party and i don't want them to get busted but at the same time i don't want karan walking away
oH MY GOD
uh WHAT
oh ooooof who? martin and danielle?
almost violated another girl
that many of our friends attended
he walked on two people having sex
sketchy afterparties
Yeah cindy that's what I mean
uhhh summary is
Bjt I also care about christina
but people were drinking
what do you mean cindy?
`no one liked karan`that's not true
I'm conflicted because Karan needs to be punished
ur right
oof
problem: can't report without exposing everyone
<@!105508293522264064> is this something we should know?
we cant just socially shun him and call it good
do we report him?
<@!105508293522264064> wat
We need to let people know..?
wait tell us more ken
*up
no one liked karan and they hate him now
what do you mean?
which is really fkd uo
women Remember these things
that shit follows people for a lifetime
he did much more
Not even a week after the happening
alot of the girls are still hella pissed
its like wow my assault got spread through rumors
shit you're right
Yeah probably not a good idea to confront the victim about that so blatantly
christina's gonna look back on homecoming night and remember this
because like
yeah dont bring it up
you're right
i thought about asking it earlier, but i wasnt sure when the best time to plug it into the convo was
i dont want to bring it up to her
karan's shitty move on her probably hurt her emotionally
there's probably Some kind of shock
i havent talked to her but i don't want to bring that up to her
yeah
That's the most important thing to me rn
Yeah is she ok
and is christina ok? i feel like i should have asked this earlier
probably not
do admins/staff know about it?
the metoo movement is not counterintuitive
to clarify
sit
we can't just like
karan that is
yeah
do people know about it?
helical gears are counterintuitive
idk man
it was right after aziz ansari
what do we do with karan
just out of curiosity
whether or not metoo/timesup had gone too far
oh it was
pretty sure it wasn't `counterintuitive`
it was a weird one
idr the wording exactly
counterintuitive?
no we had a thought talk last year on whether or not it was counterintuitive
it will be (tense is important), but i don't think we're seeing drastic effects at the moment
metoo movement is still a baby, its the early stages
I think it was a thought talk possibly
so possibly now unless more and more people take this platform
I think we already had a similar one about if it was beneficial or not
ok something similar happened in the 90s and it just died down
its still in like development
oh god
and focus
discuss
(National Debate) Resolved, the #MeToo movement will be effective in reducing sexual assault
the metoo movement lacks a order
wait ok somewhat relevant but I wanna hear opinions
the metoo movement is amazing because it can give us that springboard
yeah exactly
where im less desensitized
well the next step after this shock is to do something with this kind of energy. again not now. but at least with the me too movement. thats already a thing we can do
ok lets keep the comparisons a little more fair
exactly how i feel
i take metoo seriously but i take it like even more seriously now
yeah same
i mean i was disgusted by larry nassar and usa gymnastics and tbh im drawing a lot of parallels
yeah knowing that about him now is really fucking uncomfortable rip
it makes life easier
disillusionment of people you thought you could trust just cuz you knew them
we like to think good of people
but when its specific thats when it actually sparks something
karan just gives vibes man
yeah, i think putting names to it makes it hit closer to home
you know abstractly
like i get that feeling
i knew shit like that goes down but i was shocked when it was people i knew like karan and christina
i understand
can't relate in this case but I get the feeling
yeah
cuz that's kinda how i'm feeling
i mean same
i mean, is it weird to say that i'm not surprised but i'm also still shocked?
just saying that the correlation is there, and that specifically, it is incredibly unsurprising that shit went down at hoco afterparties bc that always fucking happens
i'm certainly not the expert here
not saying the events are a problem
fair, but not as many kids party and get white girl wasted on any weekend besides like hoco/prom
fix them first then
How else will you ~forget your problems~
Americans just turn every holiday into an excuse to drink
people get drunk regardless of the occasion
you gotta be a really moral person
self control is all you got
I mean hoco night was the reason people were under the influence, it kinda had something to do w it, just the event itself not really
people don't consider consent when they're sober so i don't expect them to when they are under the influence
we are coming around to my problem with "the influence"
people were under the influence so shit went down, hoco had nothing to do with it
but i strongly agree that it shouldnt
You cant give consent when you are too drunk to stand properly
i was never particularly aware of this
it really Shouldn't
shit always goes down
Especially because people were under the influence
ye
its hoco
I'm sure a lot of shit went down hc night
holy shit
i didn't want to bring this up when we first mentioned this here cuz we weren't talking about it a lot in here, and i was scared it would look bad but like
i like cars !
and have the community speak about their opinions
welcome to being a grown up
karan is just the beginning
I mean I don't have a list or whatever but there's no way it was just him lol
idk i think that like we still need to make an example out of this situation
I miss freshmen year where we would just talk about cars
he's never going to be the only one
he's not the only one
oh god, don't tell me there's more
yeah, the karan thing kinda made me freak out
nope
not just karan
karan
but i
It's just that this looks like one of those things where you can find a hashtag for it on instagram
karan
karan
yeah
ok true
this aint uncommon
the bomb threat i was like oh...
yep
i also want to bring up that lowkey sexual harrassment happened during homecoming after parties so you know
tru katya
like same with school shootings
like the media spews so much bad shit that I have become desensitized
can't say I'm overly surprised though
it's really poorly founded thought in hindsight
I mean I was def aware that shit went down at skyline I just didn't know how often I think
i guess under the illusion that we were lucky for some reason
fair enough
i wonder if the athletic director was involved in this
Yes I'm aware but it comes as a shock nonetheless because of media conditioning whether I want it to or not
it is
just
i always knew this was universal
super liberal or not
one of them is the bully dude
guys this is a universal thing not just the east side of the US
what's new
people are shitty
isnt this case about the authoritative members of isd involved in this
yeah exaclty
snide remarks are best made with one foot out the door
I'm just quite scared because even in a superliberal area considered activist and outspoken this still happens
like the papa johns thing
"several people are typing..."
i still think its problematic to have super highup ppl in isd that participated because none of them will leave unless there is backlash
lol
"fix this shit cuz we sure wont"
Yeah I agree
yeah
also weird
a little late
that's ages away
that's
uh
why
we could do something at graduation
i think it's a good time to reflect with each other like we're doing now
nobody is saying to not do anything if things look sus in a week either
but like
okay lets just all establish now that nobody is saying we act now
i do think we should give skyline reaction time and isd
of course
fair
i never said now
less of apathy and more of thinking time tbh
ok im not sayihng now
but like chill for a few days
listen I am jsa pres I am all for that #fightapathy shit
i never was
just saying we should just wait
give it time
not saying we should
i still dont think we should be apathetic
i guess i always thought skyline was ok for some reason
🐧🐧🐧
i think i'm suffering some disillusionment cuz i always thought "we need to fix these problems because they're happening in other places and it's bad." i just didn't realize it was under my nose the whole time too. in hindsight, i don't know why i didn't think that
yeah basically ken
experience is the numba one lesson
partially my fault too bc i knew about all these rapes happening at skyline but i didn't do anything
but like it wasnt something i put much thought to
there is no rape lobby though
i guess its naiive
🐧🐧🐧
i did take it seriously but i was detached from it because i felt like something like this wouldnt happen near me
you care about the school and you care about the kids that we're leaving behind. valid
ok guns lobbying is stupid
its so cute !!
gene thats a valid concern
far better
🐧
honestly in my opinion it shouldn't take something as drastic and as close to home as this for us to take metoo seriously but sometimes thats what it takes. like with march for our lives, it took a bunch of kids being fed up with school shootings after their own school shooting to rise up
wat 😦
ken calling people chicken, lol
is it valid to be scared that we're gonna leave skyline and nothing might change for like a decade?
i was more detached from it
idk it made it more realistic
the metoo movement should have always been relevant to us
and skyline's environment
i was just scared for people's safety i guess
u sound like my mum
you're right
ok
;-;
it really brings the metoo movement to life
google it kenneth
wat dat
because like
i think we should still bring awareness
dunning kruger effect
you said something because you are angry and that makes sense. but with these kinds of things you just gotta simmer down and let things happen until you, as a member of society, are called into play
🐔
what was that thing we were talking about in tok? the graph? that was me
i was speaking out of my ass about something i didn't have full knowledge about earlier (and was super ambiguous about what i was saying too)
i don't think you need to be sorry or anything
i mean you should be
and to clarify, this is a lot for me to take in at once for me. so sorry, i'm not really reacting great right now, guys. i have no idea what think anymore. this is just all so terrible, and i'm just still kinda in shock.
i was never looking into speaking out right now. i was intending on waiting, but i only thought there was one incident just 10 minutes ago. i don't think i made that very clear because i was also talking about the bomb threats at the same time, and i'm running low on sleep and just spouting nonsense. sorry if i caused any confusion or said anything that seemed kinda stupid.
laws and rules aint shit and people dont care about them
you can't change people and their morals
i just wanna say that regardless of what we can do about rape at skyline it's gonna keep happening. its not about punishment or discipline by the school. its about the people doing it
i think we should speak up about this case as an example for other cases
if you want something to speak up about right now perhaps you can focus on rape cases that happen behind the scenes at skyline
i really hate how passive i've gotten about this. like it happens so often that i literally just don't bat an eyelash when it happens again and again
i have no idea what to think anymore
people really are the worst
the world is a sad place at times
but that's terrifying
which is really sad ;-;
which i didn't even think about to be honest
it is true
that's probably true
let alone take it to court
u right
to be blunt I'm pretty sure more people get raped at Skyline then people report getting raped at Skyline
you should
all of this
i hate this
WAT??
that was that one
no it was somwthing that happened our sophomore year
i honestly never knew about any of this
wat
i think it was in the locker room. she was an underclassman at the time
another sister got raped
... there was another one?
get the emotions flowing
i never heard of this either, i heard a bout a different rape
i mean, the fact that we're talking about it means it served its purpose as a hook
which are often best done by over dramatic statements
Yeah I dont blame them
I think they are trying to make a point
i dont even believe the hook is true but k
Ngl
Thats like one of the most rhetoric-loaded statements I've read this month tho
it's not fair
I'm not going to let emotions get in the way of being fair
they went in
lowkey court intros are treated like creative writing
damn
hahahah
never forget the hook
i'm not even sure what's happening anymore
That's a hook
man what a way to start a document
no
well when a woman says she got raped why wouldn't you take her word for it
“In Issaquah, football is God.”
the courts are far more reliable than the public
yeah
wasn't gonna mention it but the way the intro was written
oml the beginning lol
not the court case
no
isn't that wrong though
now court cases have been filed and solved and new ones are being filed
because at the time it would have been gossip
i would've been pissed had i heard it about it when it happened
this is the first time i've heard about it
i never heard about this
okay well when i was a freshman i heard about it from other people but nobody did shit they just treated it like school gossip and now all of a sudden we want to act? lowkey four years too late
I'm just angry that they covered it up for 4 years
i didnt?
I never heard about this incident
i'm sorry if it sounded like i wanted to do things right now
im just,,,,really surprised that people are angry right now. instead of when we first heard about this when we were freshmen
same
^
i was actually gonna talk to paananen should things get more sus
I'm sure the parents know by now and some are gonna raise hell
im buddy buddy with paananen so if yall want your questions answered
but if they dont say anything its sus
They gotta
Theyll give feedback eventually
ywah im gonna wait
😮
admin*
im gonna talk to steen
give them the weekend and maybe monday
no about adim
was myers a football coach then
g u y s what do you WANT from the school district right now its the middle of the night. do you want everyone to be up and running around freaking out and trying to resolve this right now
I still talk with him on a personal level
i want her to get fired from the district
donna hood  literally specifically hid information from the school district so the kids could go to other schoools
I should ask Myers
it has been a few hours
There has not been a reaction
i agree with that
i was just saying if they don't do something over the next few days, we should be pissed
We can protest an inappropriate reaction
it's sus
however,, from what we've seen so far w the football coaches n shit...........
i never said to do stuff literally this minute
^^
wait at least a few days guys
it has been less than 24 hours since we heard about this. im sure admin trying to sort shit out right now
this is not the time to do anything
if admin continued to ignore this and continue covering shit up then yeah okay i get why you'd want to act on it but right now what  are we supposed to do
we cant be apathetic
ayyy noah i see u using ur fancy stuff
so what do you want us to do
okay yeah that's what they're doing
you investigate who made the decisions back then in denying them help and hold them accountable?
you don't even know how admin is gonna respond to this
you don't
a college junior/senior is going back to her high school and suing the district for not investigating something that happened to her when she was a junior. what do you do
few things are `beyond our powers` they're just beyond our resolve
i'm a little confused on that
if this came out when it happened, people would be pissed
but isnt the only reason this isn't relevant anymore because they covered it up?
this is just beyond our powers and what we can do about it
btw im not saying i think she's lying
okay this whole case is unrreal because we don't even glorify football anymore
this is an example of how something terrible happend to students and the district wanted to cover it up
i think it still applys to our education
let it play out
this isn't really about our education
more  of the district and how they handled the case
not protesting skyline
the school doesnt care about our education
they have a council no?
alright
just curious
uhhhhhhhh doubt it
does hennig call shots when there's a bomb threat?
The boys arent here and the same admin arent here
But I think protesting skyline isnt gonna work
Rightfully so why did they cover it up like that
it will all go through the district
Its donna hood that's being under fire
but still its really interestingf :/
What did hennig even do lmao hes irrelevant to the case
i'm reading it
def not henning
read the law stuff
yet, def not hennig's fault
Hennig is out of this mess
donna hood works for our district now
The lawsuit is against donna hood and theile
it would make sense if she wanted compensation
we literally have a different principle
what would they investigate? they all graduated
same superintendent tho
district refused to investigate
the problem with this case is that it was 4 years ago. 1) what are they gonna do 2) that admin is not the same admin we have right now
ill check it out
thanks katya
like the law stff
this has a photocopy of the lawsuit
i understand it
it takes forever to get to the bathroom hehehe
https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/sisters-sue-issaquah-school-district-after-enduring-rape-bullying/281-608175168
i hate they did that
what if it's a student though?
gotta say tho
at this point we even locked all our doors but the front ones
even if it was a bomb
admin is standing by the door like All the Time
it could literally just be a student
if some random shady dude got in
i never even heard about the threat until i read the email
*would of known
so i think they would known
skyline has a lot of security cameras tho
this isnt a utopia
by the time you find hard evidence, won't people be dead already?
we will be goikg out the field every other day
then rumors happen
i don't particularly like that they notified us after it all went down. luckily it didn't turn into anything deadly but a random evacuation out of nowhere would've sent the school into a panic
at this rate
with no hard evidence ?
evacuation while the police investigated?
how should have they handled it
its really upto their security team
but with what's been going on in the past year, is that really best?
in the isd
really?
basically all schools do it like this now
skyline
pine lake
they do that every single time now
you want recognition? you want them to address it? okay they can but they aren't going to go past that
first off, the way the handled the bomb threat was really really problematic
honestly having only one issue to concretely back up the protest is not super effective
if you guys are really trying to fight back what is your goal and what do you want from skyline and ISD.
because the way they are treatinf it now and then is disgusting
someone could make a comparison between the administration, all the info should be public
we dont know what is going behind the scenes
id they didnt fet punished five years afo fhen they will now
https://komonews.com/news/local/rape-victim-files-suit-against-issaquah-school-district-for-refusing-to-investigate-abuse
that is true...
harvey weinstein happened a while ago but atill massive backlash
well that's just great
administration could have hugely changed
theres like two of them katya
so what
^
google skyline rape case
like first if all this was like 4-5 years ago
is this only coming up now because of the lawsuit?
<@!460689096646590465>
if they addressed it, what would they say?
what do you want links on?
one sec emily
what's happened?
can i get some links please
disgusting
i think its disgt
we gotta chill out a bit
also they are shitty about disabilities like ducich experienxdd
ISD maybe not, but skyline at least?
its been 24 hours gene
skyline could at least address it, right?
they are a huge corporation
like
jesus
wowowowow give em some time
hold on guys i legit do not understand why we need to do a protest on this. think realistically
honestly, if they don't immediately address this tomorrow or monday, that's a huge sign of corruption
they dont wanna fk up again
u know like
did anyone think that shs or isd will change their policies after hearing this
i think some teachers would be down too
good idea
that could work
in issaquah downtown
or is that too much?
WE NEED TO PROTEST OUTSIDE OF THE ISD BUILDING
go somewhere and protest?
not senior skip day but like
for when these messages are on giant boards in a court room
skip school
skip class but get together somewhere to protest?
like walk out
im willing to@do@this
people might just think "those hs brats are skipping class again"
honestly, a walk out is feasible, cuz a fair amount of teachers would support us
hello jury my name is Noah Righi and I do not condone arson
walk outs might not be effective for further influencing others
a d a walk out
like what alan said: they're money-driven
we fotta make one of thise
idk i'm not the person who knows most about this issue
like you know that thing that was going around during the kavenaigh trials
cuz if ISD won't listen to us, then we kinda have to expose them at that point
we dont need to expose isd we need to being awareness about what they are tryunf to do
gov?
wat???
"step up your game" isn't valid
honestly, we can skip talking to isd and go straight to gov
specifically
rema posted a thing about the case and admin tried to get her to take it down to control the situation
well what do you want them to do
and not suck
that isd/admin needs to step its game up
yeah lets Expose ISD but whos gonna take this seriously everyone knows ISD is full of shit
the fact skyline's sweeping this shit under the rug
can i ask what we're raising awareness for
then present to admin
well, as long as we're doing something, i'm down
do social media, raise awareness, then gather signatures
ysah but others do
they do
petitions can get shredded
skyline/ISD doesn't check social media
we need to get media involved
petition?
we gotta do social media and protest
surveys suck
but it'd be fun
helen, it doesn't need to be successful. if it isn't we prove ISD is full of shit and get enough students on our side to do a walkout
Okay I'm gonna stop you guys before you make the police show up again
lol me too I'm not ready to be arrested for arson
no survey
well then you'd be cherrypicking facts
i was kidding ;-;
what happens if we don't get the results we want?
oml
tbh.... <@!105508293522264064> ...... I'm down
idk if a survey will be effective
ok
kenneth, no
student and parent survey
burn the school :0
not just directly the admin
yeah, but no one's gonna do this. you think skyline's gonna address this?
we need some sort of response from the community
where thus speeadst
Like a senior skip day, but for everyone
we need to atart an online thing
wait what
noah mentioned walkout, but that's not practical if we don't approach admins/district
Then the admins will budge
not just filing a petition to the school to be destroyed in the shredder and never resurfaced
last year they wxpelled hella underclassmen for doing drugs bevaus they wanted to cover uo and have their achool be pristr
....
If you wanna make change, start making the school less money
yeah something public like that
we could make one with questions written by students about problems we're concerned about and hit them with "hey, dipshits, 73% don't feel safe. do something or else we will"
ae need to atart a movement on social media
for the public
Everyone knows despite skyline trying to cover it up desperately
if awareness is the goal, then a published essay is good
lets go on strike 😉
that our school has this problem
Do anything
Survey and essay and petitions etc dont really
it's all about making people aware
i don't think anything we do can directly make perfect change
you know how the survey last week was shit cuz it included names and the questions were really not relevant?
an essay. a published survey
What will help
This one's being leveraged against the school for not handling the aftermath
im not seeing how this will help
This is criminal case behavior
publish it online
we need an eloquent essay
we're seniors. we could get really good data
The rape case was already decided, the guys pleaded guilty
petition
or at least an anonymous survey
What the fuuuuuxk
again
guys
wtf
legal@shit
school is gov property
isn't there some sort of legal consequence of rape even when you're a minor?
shoukd be fucjing legal
it was no bueno
the fuck
civil?? omg
ye
yuppers
what the hell???
so he gors to issaquah
really?!
It is a Civil case, mind you
a freshman when we were sophomores raped a girl and all he did was get expelled
i'm pissed that the guys did it, but i'm also pissed skyline tried to hide this for 4 years
I think this stems from a lack of understanding of the legal system
Yeah they're trying to cover it up
like now this type of reaxtuon woukd be shitty a couple ueara afo it would have been dine and j hafe if
^
Damn
i think the point we're missing that they tried to sweep this under the rug
it currently is
i genuinely believe that this new wave of feminism will be about fighting rape and this tyoe of shitty reaxtuon
Get what they deserved?
they were just like "let's just transfer these shitheads so we don't have to deal with them"
Noah is it too late to do emergency running start because I don't wanna go to Skyline anymore
So they didnt?
yeah this sounds really against protocol
But the district did a really fucking bad job of enforcing whatever it was and then the girls got terrorized
yeah
noah, i'm not concerned about my safety. i'm concerned about this continuing in skyline when we're gone
I'm reading that the boys were supposed to be under a protection order situation and needed to transfer
not that that makes people feel better
statically we're all fine
or even higher
district
is urterly disgusting
we should voice something to admins or something
the girls are bring the suit after they are adults I assume
and the rape xase
again
yeah
i feel ducking unsafe
Which totally sounds like Skyline
what do you mean by "it"?
i fucjinf hate how they inveatigated the bomb theeat while we were af achool
I think they're trying to get Skyline in trouble for not handling the situation enough
probably
that would be it then
at the time?
all were minors
were they minors?
they probably got what they deserved, legally speaking
the public is supposed to be able to audit the system through it's transparency
Bc the girls definitely are
Why arent the boys involved
also, they investigated potential bomb threats while we were literally in school yesterday
😮
I'm just a little confused about all of this
it's for the public good
I don't care enough about it, the school can get sued I'll be outta here by then
what is the role of the people that are known? the admin...?
when bringing a lawsuit you aren't given any privacy
Regardless of their identity why is the situation this way
why specify right now
find out urself
Ken if you're not gonna tell don't tease
i thought this came out today?
they already pleaded guilty?
no like
i know
people know
it’s been a thing
yeah
really?
oh we know who
wow
It's only the teachers that really care
the guys already pleaded guilty
aside from "they're sisters"
no one did i don't think
From my experience with the administration, all they're concerned about is earning money
The girls didnt get exposed right??
its literally for every for case
Isd too but like
if you expose the girl you gotta expose the guys
Against the guys
No shouldnt it be like
it emerged literally today
it’s a rape case that’s why
idk that's suspish too
privacy
I'm just a little lot confused
bc ppl are dumb
Why are the boys never mentioned in the lawsuit yeah
i was talking to doran and admin is incredibly full of shit most of the time
What the fuck man
admin is actually really shit to the teachers
What the hell is Skyline gonna do about it? Give them detention? This shit went down in 2014
it's super terrible
read the articles if you get the chance
absolute shit
like
*to the
the admins basically were shit the the victim
rape cases happen all the time, but schools are supposed to help out somehow
how is that solving anything
anonymous survey but actually crafted around student and parent concerns
^^^^^
My question is why are you leveling the case at Skyline and not the two guys who did it
like what
we should do something
isd and skyline admin generally being a shitfest
rip
my friend at newport heard about it even
that’s why all the police were here
either petition or anonymous survey
Why do people do this
that's what i'm trying to tell y'all
Wtf man
y i k e s
ooooh
i know
bomb threat yesterday
rape case emerged today
I'm
that's what we're discussing
ye we were talking about it earlier
what did the district Do
What the actual fuck
sophmores always get the short end of the stick
I just figured out about this
They're not really, it's just the different types of people at Skyline span all the seniority levels
my impression of the current junior class is that they're really short
no one ever knows about sophomores during any year lol
i know we're fucked up
i know the juniors are supposedly rather fucked up
idk much about the sophomores
the freshmen are supposedly getting rekt already
they're not that different
why is it that different classes are so different?
Freshies are either so shy you'll break them by speaking to them or they're fucking lunatics
ok Imma disagree with that I think our current sophomore class is really especially fucking annoying
we're perpetrating the same skyline culture at this point
idk i'm just oblivious as hell
we sure didn't do anything to try to stop it
oh yaaaa def
rip
theres nothing different about freshies each year
but were we like that as freshies?
our year IS the same
literally under the table?
our year was the same lol
Lmao
thats never changed
vaping/drugs/alcohol are pretty prevalent under the table
A freshman in my health class told me she was gonna go to Harvard
"several people are typing..."
freshies are always wack
spill
what do you mean?
oh?
and wow holy shit they are a slightly twisted class
i was talking to some v pure freshies in rocketry
It definitely will
the 9th graders are a piece of work
all of our underclassmen friends are stuck here for a while
i'm scared skyline's gonna devolve further while we're gone
I'm so happy we're gonna leave this place soon
kids are dumb
that was my first reaction
honestly
yeah, that's what i've been hearing
hell could be the same person
The math one
It's possible we have another bathroom stall bomb threat just like at PLMS
i think it's probably math hallway?
wait is it the DECA bathrooms?
Third floor bathrooms been closed for "vandalism" for the last few days
i really don't know what to think right now
idk, am i overreacting? i'm just really scared skyline won't do anything to address this
threat was posted in third floor bathroom apparently
but skyline's not gonna email that out
granted, word of mouth
i heard they sent some policemen to skyline yesterday
how do they "investigate"?
so they didn't know if it was legit, but they kept us in class as they were checking it out
they literally investigated it while we were at school
Like, different from the one we've got
it said the threat was determined to be not a concern
Walking out of skyline, I've seen police men around campus
there was already an email
I honestly don't know
you guys think skyline will address this tomorrow or next week?
not through force
i can make people do things via  s o c i a l  m a n i p u l a t i o n
voldemort?
like what are they looking for
"i can make ppl do things"
"i like to fight"
someone posted a link to the rape case article in here somewhere. it was followed up by intense bullying
and ISD's general suckiness
well then
and bombing threats
at skyline
rape case
we're listening to lit music
join the playlist in the voice channel
david!
How did this conversation start?
what do you mean?
Also, how did we get here
it's kinda saying "these are the problems. plz send help"
it's also less aggressive
if we had students write one, it might be more valuable
yeah
they'd put two completely unrelated things together in the same question
lmfao that survey was a fucking joke
maybe an anonymous survey similar to what we did the other day but like focused explicitly on our actual concerns?
i imagine some people would be hesitant to sign it though
the petition could
yeah out of nowhere I dont think it'd get much traction
otherwise they might be less sympathetic
shouldn't we go to bigger steps only when smaller ones don't?
fair
that's way harder to organize
s e n i o r  s k i p  d a y
it hits their bottom line hardest
the best would be a walk out really
again, make it a percentage of skyline students
which is hard to get when you're limited to students and their parents
we could technically make it pretty huge
having signatures is impressive but not emotionally compelling unless it's huge
yeah well idk what we could do besides the petition/survey thing
helen's right on that one
depends on that action you're proposing to take with the district
not very
idk how hard it'd be to convince people
f''(morality)=emotion
we're seniors with connections to every class at skyline via link crew, ib, jsa, music group, deca, asb, etc.
we could do that
lmaooo
it's not even just a metaphor
why does the math metaphor make sense
second or third derivative of morality
x% believe this change should be made?
that's not morality, that's emotions
x% of students at shs don't feel safe?
it can show up as a statistic
morality doesn't show up on a budget or a statistic or a building
not just feelings of frustration
probably not but I can't imagine they'd be happy
we need to have a lot of justification
we wouldn't be breaking any rules tho, right?
tbh I don't wanna do shit until I'm outta here and safely admitted to college
if we can get enough of the student body on board, it could have a lot of impact
idk man
king county?
that's going too big
if your boss won't change, talk to your boss's boss
because of the mentality it leads to
do we pull a "big business move" and file a complaint not to isd but washington department of education?
sometimes that doesn't go well
they just need to try their best to avoid trouble
morally, maybe
it's literally their job
they're obligated to
they aren't rewarded for making us happy
they're not stupid
maybe not do anything directly, but they'll at least recognize people aren't happy
they have thought it through
make them rethink their shit at least
well we could annoy the admin i guess
private schools are substantially worse in my experience
let's be real what is a petition going to do
ISD is still better than my last school ISF
could we just get like a bunch of skyline students sign a petition or something?
if a bus is a liability issue, we're literally talking about a rape case and bomb threats now
who the fuck runs isd
i feel like that's what happened when pitt's tried to complain about band things
welp karma bit them
I'm hella bitter in case you couldn't tell
as a board we tried to talk to isd last year, they were super patronizing and just droned on with their usual excuses i.e. "if someone driving to a chapter con attached to the name skyline jsa got into an accident and died, our school could get sued!! it's a liability issue"
we're a shithole
it's hell, I'm honestly shooketh that skyline and issaquah are still strong considering all the bullshit we deal with
we're the only district that isn't allowed to host or even advertise chapter cons, we have to bus to conventions even when they're super close, we have 1-2 week turnarounds for forms bc they want everything 45 days early
they are incentivized to do this shit by the system
it makes sense it ends up that way
stubborn, unreasonable, absurdly strict, and obsessively paranoid about liability issues/potential for getting sued
academically we are very good, which is what they measure so...
i'm genuinely curious
how does it compare to other school districts?
yeah well anyone in jsa can tell you that isd is literally the most fucking obnoxious school district in the state
not grade wise though
they literally let us stay in class during a bomb threat yesterday apparently
oh haha noah you joined our music
probably true for a lot of public schools
just overall
seriously though skyline's admin, and ISD, are shit
ye
yea
lmao it was uploaded?
sad
probably tbh
did the youtube video get taken down?
I know
that was epic in a terrible way
I"m also never gonna get over the beginning of the year nazi salute
that was my impression anyways
I mean he gave Sherm a good review but he just seemed pissed off when he asked us questions n shit
he seemed super aggressive when he visited our econ class
is it "hennig"?
he stands outside the school every day in the cold to greet students
Hennig scares me
hennig is cool too
Paananen is the only cool one
rip henning
there's been some staff changes, idk how extensive, obviously we have a diff principal now but some of my least favorite people are still in it
businesses look out for themselves
is this admin still at skyline?
I mean, can't say I'm surprised that skyline's admin did jack shit =/
yup
it must have been a big deal
ye
like everyone knew....
the girl said on the article that she was bullied a lot afterwards
it was super talked about
ye
really?!
but i dont remember soooo
there's been multiple threats at the school since we've been here
but apparently it was super talked about during 7th grade
thats why im not gonna spread
yeeeee
scary
still
rape case was a couple years back
bomb threat was literally yesterday
statistically you're fine
i'm also feeling way less safe right now
if they are going to talk to someone talk to an authority
but like
different
spreading witching hunting conclusions is a really bad idea
are you saying the bomb threat is tied to the rape case?
someone in bio today told me police came by skyline to investigate a threat
keep it to themselves
is it true that there was a bomb threat yesterday?
some dudes in my group chat
but like
so hate to throw some more bad news out there
lol it wasnt me
witch hunting is a bad idea
like what did they do
um
not gonna say who for privacy reason
what person?
via some witch hunting
we found the person
this feel like slightly more than tea
this happened at skyline?!
holy fucking shit i'm reading this right now
holy fucking shit
holy shit
woah what?
😮
football players gave younger student alcohol, raped her when she was too drunk to fight back
I remember hearing about the case
I think I know who it is
that was my sister's year

ill just send al ink
for not protecting them from harassment
for what
two girls from skyline are suing isd
i heard something happened with skyline?

we love you
good != kind
stop that noah
hahahahahahahahaha, no I'm not
your guys' decisions are yours to make. but you guys are kind people at heart and don't try to harm others, and i can always respect that
which is more important
you're a good person if you act and think like a good person
we act like good people, that doesn't make you a good person... or does it?
inb4 little do you know
rip
i appreciate that at least
although you guys are great people too
i guess you guys are right
you should be neutral
^^
you shouldn't be thankful for meeting standards
wow, i am exponentially more thankful for you guys now
my own and others
I thrive on the uncomfortable
yuhm
the most uncomfortable situation from our after party was david being uncomfortable with 50 shades of grey
just to start the night off
drinking straight vodka from the bottle
the most sketch thing about ours was 50 shades, remember
when you add alcohol and drugs things get exponentially sketch
they get more sketch
and the worst thing at our after party is that i'm still trying to finish the food
i knew after parties were sketch, but i didn't think they got that sketch
like what does the phone in your pocket/on a table have to do with someone else
drunk excuse lol
I'm sorry but that excuse is hilarious
yep
i'm not applying to many ivy's ngl
hoco after party i'd assume

hmm what tea should we discuss
seeing as we're in `the-tea` channel
i started playing the rest on my kazoo after i sent that
the front door
shut
*no more*
*don't hurt me*
*baby don't hurt me*
*what is love*
rip
never heard of it
romantic love?
agree
all relationships should
they should in the end be the same
i guess we should specify, the topic at hand is *romantic love* lmao
of course
something something sounds like talking from personal xp?
that really doesn't help
... rip
also don't then go on to give examples
it doesn't go over well
yea but don't say that to your parents in response to them saying they love you unconditionally
`truly unconditional love is fake`
shouldn’t our group trips be under the “other planning” channel
u can't tell me what i can do with my life
save up
then i guess we'll plan trips a bit closer to home haha
college
i’m broke
would it be feasible to fly to japan?
we should actually plan a group trip for the summer
legit though i’d love to go
if this became a real thing i would want to go too
I've been thinking about a trip to Japan since this last summer
but fr I'd be down
proposal: group trip to Japan!
good going
you buy your ticket, fly to japan, then realize you don't have hotel reservation, money, and you don't know japanese
just tell me when and I'll buy my ticket
me!
who wants to go to japan with me
i've been to hailun and beijing
me neither
I really haven't traveled much within China either
Otherwise yeah haven't been anywhere else in Asia that's depressing
I've been to Japan but only for like 2 days
sure
do you wanna hear about karan kavenaugh
in this virtual chat space
what is "here"
who is still here?
i guess i was never really gone in the first place
welp i'm officially back
imagine china but they accepted google into their culture
coming to think of it, i've only been to canada mexico and china
or any asian country other than china
never been to taiwan

I had to make it less wholesome it was getting out of hand
Did not see that one coming
Holy shit

Too wholesome for Cindy
well then
oh

I like my women like I like my tea
We've just made some jokes and roasted each other a bit
I feel like none of us have actually spilled any tea
nice
Procrastinating tea spilling too?
hang on for 27 more minutes
to spill tea or whatever
i will be back at 6:30
Just to have a stock response to whenever Sasha says a synonym of "penis"
whenever a form of "penis" and nothing else is said: "thanks ____! very cool."
Can we get a bot to do something like that?
wait <@!472541429130854421>  spill you never said your ideal type or whatever

whoever you end up with will be v lucky to have you
No one ever asks if I'm dating someone cuz they know whoever I'm talking to can't be THAT desperate
not sure what to follow that up with but that's there
I was once confessed to by a guy
but it happens + I have been asked if dating multiple female friends before
I hug literally everyone in sight tho
probably less so bc it's more normal for girls to be super affectionate w each other
I've always had the slightest suspicion that the tea in certain groups is that I'm gay for some reason
someone thought katya and i were dating
yes
do girl friends get shipped?
";play"
you aren't best friends with someone until someone mistakes you for a couple
alexa play bromance by ryan higa
nothing is better than a bromance
gene you have one night sail ships
Maybe 6
I've had like 5 male ships
ooof
Peter X Alan
I've had 3 male ships so far
when you grow a pair
gay ships are the most fabulous though
when am I gonna get a m/f ship
what do you have against guys
Why else was I lurking on that knives convo from yesterday?
guys guys guys
it's always another guy
I would still kill him in a heartbeat
ok I'll stop lmfao
sitting in a tree
gene and alan
ooooooo
❤
oooOOOooOOO he said the L worddddd
I love y'all tho (yes, even Alan)
oof
I'm secretly seven small hamsters trying to operate a human mecha
its tough love
1st stage of genocide
so you've found out my secret
dehumanization
ah
damn
Alan, you're not part of "people"
cindy i will smother you in love until you BELIEVE IT
including me gene?
I'm an asshole and I embrace it
fake news
pink starburst
You all are some of the nicest people ever
shhshshshhhshh
and also one of the nicest people I know
I think I got a bit better after the haircut
emily you're gorgeous
i have a pretty inflated ego so
sometimes I look in the mirror and think damn u pretty but most of the time it's like meh you have an ok face which I'm chill with
just like my academic record
I've settled my self image as "good enough"
I could look decent if I gave two shits
Which I'm content with
I'm decidely mediocre
i dont think anyone on this server is particularly unattractive i'll put that out there
and no thanks to you
peter who
thanks
And you got him one too
He got you that sing-a-gram after all
Alan, if you want someone to think you're pretty, go find Peter
i'm not gene, but you're pretty
he needs it
boost alan's self esteem gene
No
Yeah, ik
gene tell me I'm pretty
oh I was responding to everyone is beautiful not alan is an asshole
physical beauty does not equate to inner beauty. there are some hot people with shitty personalities and its like damn ur a waste of a visual
I'm not trying to be serious lmao
true that
again, not to be rude, but DEFINITELY false, if they have a shitty personality it's an instant turn off
Alan is just an asshole
stupid is forever
Except Alan
beauty fades
Nearly everyone is beautiful tho
stop
Oh from my perspective? No one is attractive *dabs*
i could be the ugliest fucking thing on the planet to one person and the most beautiful goddess the universe has created to another
this question is very subjective of course
but from the individual perspective, false
ok yes
false
everyone is attractive it depends whos looking
but
Oh hey
not to be rude
not really anything specific, but someone who I can call my partner
-Emily probably
fact
true
E v e r y o n e  i s  a t t r a c t i v e
god idk how to describe my type i should just give yall a list of people i find mildly attractive and let you draw the pattern
Y'all think I'm being easy, but it's really hard to put up with me for 24 hours a day
I already shared
go
types
Ay
warm and damp

All next to each other

Sina weibo

Josephina
dear lordy what a time
anything starting with s and ending in -ina
dont even get me started with sasin
even sandeep when people say it fast
any variation of cindy, sidney
I get confused when people say Alan, Alec, Ellie, etc.
the name thing is a universal experience
i mean, i look around and get confused when people say jane's name
well she is real enough that that I look around when someone says her name
I always tune out everyone at my math table including Noa
youve convinced me gene
what interaction
probably havent interacted with her that much?
has any interaction with her ever even felt real?
good question
is she a real person or like just a figment of our imagination?
does noa actually exist?
