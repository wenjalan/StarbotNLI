why are u up at 5 arguing about being pulled or pushed by the dick
Get fucked Noah
Colloquially imo Jarrett is more correct
No one cares
on why I am correct
please weigh in
<@!503787499605458954> <@!233062637922025472> you guys are up
you are the thing being referenced
yea but if I'm on a PG news station I could also just say "**I** was being pulled ~~by my dick~~"
The puller
Because it would be in reference to the other person
Pulled
would you say "I was being pushed by my dick" or "I was being pulled by my dick"
someone grabs you by the dick and starts dragging you
ok imagine this
I could not be any less aroused by force vectors
Before the sun rises
I just wanna jack off
Man
but in this case you're also the object experiencing the force
yea cause you're the force vector
Is the chair going towards me?
" I am pulling this chair"
If I were to say
Is it going towards you?
what do you mean by "in reference to humans"?
If you were to pull something
In reference to humans id say yes
pUlL iS aN iNwArDs FoRcE
why are you even responding then
LMAO
look at the god damn force vectors
what is this dumb statement
And Noah is killing me over here with his push/pull nonsense
Bruh i am literally trying to jerk it
Push is an outwards force and pull is an inwards force
so i'f you dick is in tension it's being pulled, and if it's compression it is being pushed
somehow I am unsurprised that you guys are debating the mechanics of jerking it at 4 am
yea and I'm saying tension is a pulling force and compression is a pushing force
there is no "by default" direction
Not machines
Bruh we talking about humans though
you can push something towards you and pull something away from you
as in if I pull it hard enough it rips in half (tension failure), and if I push it hard enough is gets crushed (compression failure)
And push by default is away
But pull by default is towards you
What
pull is tension, push is compression
no I'm talking in terms of dick
I'm thinking in terms of dick
You're thinking in terms of hand/arm
Ahhhhh I see
bruh is it in tension or compression
I'm pretty sure push by definition is away from you
Huh
pull is away from you, push is towards you
lol I was wondering if this was gonna be a problem
Squeezing a tube of toothpaste is more push than pull
Wait
so you're more a squeezing a tube of toothpaste man than a squishing a soda can man
Same for endless push
But endless pull would be kinda weird
I vote for pull
this stems from me thinking about filing
like if you could only do one, which is better
when jerking off which is more important the push or the pull stroke?
having some interesting thoughts tonight
hmm
When I tell you I screamed -

Mom's tattoo for those interested
donations would act as your tickets
what if I made a lottery bot
oh god I just had a bad idea
what if every time someone donated starbot would send you üëÅÔ∏è üëÑ üëÅÔ∏è
yeah same
I read it like lo-fi with a k
weird
huh
oh thats why it said by alan a coffee
I know it's supposed to be ko-fi as in like buy me a ko-fi but I always mentally hear it as "koe-fy"
that's it Starbot is getting Ko-Fi integration
OOH KO-FI HAS AN API BACKEND
I only know jim

you're now legally obligated to change your nickname to jimothy bowser
you mean you and jimothy
that's just the DM chat between me and Fran
but we already have that
I could make a supporters-only server
hmm now what should I add to Starbot to show appreciation for my supporters
https://github.com/wenjalan/Starbot
I'm putting Jimothy Bowser on the list of Starbot supporters
that's it
fran you're an amazing friend

man i make annoying passwords
i had to look up my paypal password
I'll probably scrape together another free trial of a server host from Google or Microsoft if that's the case
like of course that's not gonna cover the cost of a server but it'll at least show that people want him back enough
well yeah I guess
that's all you need?
a dollar?
whichever comes first
or when someone donates a dollar
Starbot comes back online when I find the time/motivation to get him a new server
turns out it was super easy lol
I mentioned this in another chat but the kofi was mostly made out of curiosity
lol thanks for the offer

I could get you another free tria

yeah you got up at like 6
Imma go sleep
which isnt even true afaik
Man sorry I‚Äôm loopy sorry
i mean people did say things about it being american i think
man imagine if I was in IB physics
Long live the empire?
lmao
i always forget you were
but I think I was just super antisocial
for some reason I always forget you were in that class
that made me so angry lol
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
DEFENDED IMPERIAL
fucking IB SCIENCE STUDENTS
omfg
and people said that it shouldnt
i remember at the start of IB physics we had Fowler-sanctioned discussions on whether imperial should die
i think the last 20 mins have just been my globalist views peeking through lmfao
yes yes I know realistically
annoying doesn't justify spending billions
agreed
to standardize
and it'd be very satisfying
and yes I know it'd be expensive to switch BUT IT'S ANNOYING
decimal inches basically act like metric
this irritates me bc the US doesn't have to standardize bc the US has enough influence on certain industries to force everyone else to conform to it
the reason we don't switch is because it would be very expensive to retool everything for no real gain
so all major building in the world are built with imperial measurement I beams
and steel I beam production is standardized to imperial as well
most of aerospace still uses imperial
I'm building a New United States of America and basing it on the metric system
and people dont like change cause they're feeble minded
nice round number
also I find it oddly satisfying that highway speed limits are usually 100
and all the cars
because changing all the signs costs money
IT TAKES LITERALLY SO MUCH LESS EFFORT TO DO ANYTHING
why hasn't america adopted this yet
see
100000
centimeters in a kilometer now
add that to my list of why I'm right
5280\*10 + 5000\*2 + 280*2
also agreed fuck daylight savings
impressive if you actually did that in your head
oh nice
no
so did you use a calc
MENTUL METH
63360 INCHES
or true
the story of daylight savings isn't even consistent
fuck daylight savings
so lemme say something
idk what happening but i see timezones
lmao
mentul meth
now how many centimeters are in a kilometer
METH
MENTUL
ME
SEE
CALUCLATORE
USIN
5280*12
NOT
IM
lol
alright but HOW MANY INCHES ARE IN A MILE
I was gonna say 5820
shit he got it right
it's not vague but it is an arbitrary number of feet in the modern imperial system and that makes it annoying
is fucking unrealistic as shit
knowing that theres 5280 fetet in a mile
DON'T LOOK IT UP
TELL ME RIGHT NOW
which
i heard once that it was 1000 paces of a roman soldier
HOW MANY FEET ARE IN A MILE FRAN
its not vague
uhh
a mile is just a vague idea of distance
it's especially stupid bc the US already uses metric for everything that ACTUALLY MATTERS!!!!
what the hell is an inch anymore
god fucking dammit US
metric system
like literally everything that's wrong about society
ugh
but people wouldn't be bothered to change unless they need to
I don't really see any downside to this it'd be a quality of life improvement for anyone who travels
it wouldn't matter if your life was locally focused you'd just get used to the new "normal" waking hours
people do move from timezone to timezone within days though
I think people's lives are still too locally focused to move towards a universal time zone though, like we'd need people moving constantly from timezone to timezone within the span of a single "day" to see widespread use
real timezones have curves <:oroFlirt:699017095651786762>
geographically it doesn't even make sense
plus like the politics of time zones are dumb
we just decided what each moon cycle was called
sure but that's not what we typically use day to day
not seasons
well months are loosely based on moon cycles
that's kinda what UTC time was meant to do
we already did that with months i.e. december is summer in australia
like I get why time zones became a thing just based on when the sun rises and sets but now that tech connects the globe I feel like we should just have one standardized time and have everyone get used to whatever hour the sun rises and sets where they live
we got so pissed off at deciding what time it was that one day in 1970 some people decided just to start counting in seconds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY
I have not but if the idea is that time zones are stupid then I agree
i shall
i think
i havnae
I encourage you to watch Tom Scott's video on timezones if you haven't
dates are SO fucking annoying to work with in code
not a calendar
its literally just a format
nevermind the stardate format is also based on our current system
we can't even agree on what's the right order to put stuff in
I'm in favor of a date reformatting
format
we need to fast track star trek style stardate
it is indeed quite wild
closer to 1985 years depending on how you read history
isn't it wild that our whole calendar system is based on that
around 2020 years
how much longer does it have
it's been around for what, 2000 years now?
i dont disagree with that
makes you wonder when Christianity will die out
I view religion as humanity's most outdated theory as to the true nature of the universe
when they've proven themselves corrupt time and time again through history
idk how people can still trust in churches
today I feel like people believe because they can't/struggle to accept that the universe is random
my pov is kinda that religion was created to explain unknowable unknowns, as a source of comfort bc people are uncomfortable with the unknown, but organized religion has twisted it far beyond that
it has the unfortunate side effect of being manipulated by power hungry people and misinterpreted by psychos
the way i see it religion helps people answer questions that may be hard to answer or require time and dedication to find answers to which allows people to find some hapiness and move on from those questions and do things with themselves. it can also give people a sense of purpose and therefore a reason to get out of bed in the morning
it's the root of so much unnecessary violence
but I guess I just don't see the point
obviously I'm biased, being raised by mostly non-religious parents and never having believed in any of it
there's a spiritual aspect of religion that science doesn't give you
no i think there is a purpose
but I mean from a logical pov I don't think religion has much of a purpose anymore
new axis to add to WD graph: faith
just to be clear on where i stand: im agnostic, leaning towards atheist
it's not like I wanna force people to give up their faith or anything i respect your beliefs
I hope that's not offensive to anyone here
yes
is your ideal future one without religion?
and true
true
true
well keep in mind that a) religious people tend to have more kids, b) north america and europe actually aren't that big population-wise, c) the places where population is actually rising rapidly are developing nations, especially in africa and asia
but the math just doesnt check out in my head
not cause other countries should follow the big countries or elitist shit like that
doesn't work in my head
that
but rising globally?
religion declining in big countries
I wonder if there will ever be a non-religious world
what
something else I find really interesting is that faith is declining rapidly in the US and west/north europe but rising globally
you think maybe they'd be less in the mindset of "you're bad because you're not very devout" since ~~everybody~~ most people follow the religion or would they be even more against people that arent as devout since the religion becomes tied up in nationality
I'm pretty sure the stat is that 40-50% of americans say they straight up wouldn't vote for an atheist president, so honestly, we're a less secular country than we claim
and how this kinda stuff would look like in countries with official religions
tbh Im probably way less educated about religion in general than I should be
now im just wonering what doran thinks about all this
I think a lot of times when it's people in power claiming to be devout it's more about the power than the religion
but he'll still go hold a bible in front of a church to virtue signal to his base
good point
like take Trump I'm 99% sure he doesn't actually believe in god or give a shit about daily prayers
I wonder how many of those sucky religious people aren't actually that religious
I think I've said that like 50 times in this convo
cause there's lots of religious people that suck
oh that's also very interesting
i saw that come up on reddit the otehr day--about people saying you can't be good without religion but people need a higher power to scare them into being good--someone mentioned, and i agree with them, that those people are probably good inside and frame their goodness iwthin religion and attribute it to religion and therefore don't fully understand goodness without religion since they've convinced themselves theirs comes from their faith
the person I have in mind is super normal and I honestly forget she's strongly religious most of the time, but she wears a hijab and prays and celebrates religious holidays n stuff so I mean it is still a big part of her identity
I don't mind if someone just feels they have a strong connection to god or whatever
and if they're like intolerant of different lifestyles that's a big no
those people are NG
but people who try and coerce others, manipulate them, guilt or pressure them into a way of thinking for their own gain
I mean I don't wanna sound like I'm shitting on people for believing it's more I don't think I'd be able to relate to them much if it was such a dominant part of their life
people who are good people, even if it's in promise of some divine reward, are still doing good acts at the end of the day so I don't have a problem with them
it sucks that religion *has* had ulterior motives for a lot of history though
religion by itself is fine, but religion with ulterior motives is off limits for me
you're right that it depends how it manifests
maybe I should revise that statement bc I do have good friends who follow strict religious rules and believe strongly in their god
lol
if it's like "jesus has brought us togehter" then he pulled us apart too
if i like everything else about a person but a few things are off limits and they have religious schedules they follow then it might be fine
mainly it's body proportions like waist-hip ratio. Thighs are pretty important
to me the religious thing would depend on how the devout religiousness manifests
yeah i guess there are some traits that make a girl attractive that i notice the most
I don't think I could ever be close with someone who's super devoutly religious
also general question bc I'm curious what are y'alls dealbreakers in a friendship or relationship?
bc I'm still unclear on whether that kinda thing is a result of being bi or if it's something all girls do
ok wait rewinding like 20-30 mins I still wanted to ask that question <@!472541429130854421> are you ever like drawn to specific details of a girl's appearance
if I ever saw that on someone I'd probably run
just tattoo myself to become jesus
bam
just
full torso and upper body
critical error
bad christian boy
like an entire portrait on your back
what if you got a tattoo of jesus
lol
i think i jut kept walking at that point
and she said something about it being good and me being a good christian boy for it
and i was like "no...
and one of the moms was like "you don't have any tattoos right?"
cause i dont organize parties lol
both of which i want so badlyyyy
at my grad party my mom invited family friends
he said the same about people who drive motorcycles actually
I distinctly remember one time when my dad explicitly said people with tattoos are bad/hooligans
that's about it
ways I could get my mom to disown me
1. marry a black person
2. turn gay
my mom's not against the idea, necessarily, just not huge on the thought of it being permanent
my sister kept hers secret for almost 3 years
there's that lovely cultural conservatism again
my parents are extremely anti-tattoo it's quite depressing
the only relevant problem is the tattoo
dont mind he fact that there'd be other problems if she disowned you
well actually there's a few ways
I don't think my mom would be willing to disown me
also lets just hope that your mom doesn't eventually disown you cause then she'd have to do something about that tattoo
I don't think that's weird at all
I give it a weirdness rating of uncommon but not unacceptable
and i super love it
no i think it's pretty wholesome
thats a skull by a bunch of grapes
there's this one kid i had whose dad has a tattoo on his right upper back
also fran kind of unexpected edgy but i'm super here for it
is my mom having my name on her tattoo a weird move
alan wait that's super cool
in moderation, i like skulls
as for what i'd get it of i always gravitate to rams and snakes because 
a. they're kinda neat
b. im a year of the snake aries
i just dont know in what format. also skulls cause i like skulls
has my name on it
my mom has a pretty large tattoo (around 8x6 inches) on her back
for my first I'm thinking around a collarbone or a tiny one behind an ear
I kinda really want hand tattoos but I know I can probably never actually get them
probably upper arm/shoulder thoug
or where
the problem being i dont know what i want as a tattoo
i really want a tattoo
anyways back to the story about my leg fixation lmfao that was kind of one of my other "questions for straight girls" but idk how to word it
maybe for my 19th
i really wanna get one but I'm highkey really paranoid about how that'll affect career stuff down the line so I'm still being a bit of a pussy about it for now
but i like some tattoos
YES
its not like a dealbreaker or anything
also im into tattoos
an old coworker of mine described his liking for legs as them being the "stairway to heaven"
that's always a big source of confusion, btw, as far as "am I into her or do I just really wanna be her friend?? or do I wanna BE her???"
when I thought I was straight I thought I just wanted to look like them
like I would stare and focus on that one detail
Actually nevermind
that's my shit
WHEN GIRLS WEAR HEELS AND THEIR CALVES ARE ALWAYS FLEXED
Also hands
the legs thing and the abs thing were two of the first signs that led me to realize I'm into girls
TIL jarrett (despite being an M) doesn't have a foot fetish
Now arms do things
Legs dont do anything besides carry you
Nothing really great about em
They're legs
Like
really? how come
You know I never understood the leg thing
and a strong desire to love and protect cute anime waifus
weebs with dreams, aspirations, courage, professionalism
actually they get wigs more for cosplay
I'm talking reformed weebs here
yeah but not in the right way lol
weebs dye their hair too
collarbones/clavicle area though I am fully on board with
I don't quite share that enthusiasm
I will personally pioneer a new wave weeaboo movement
we been knew lmfao
Shoulders are hot as fuck
we need a counter revolution
the ABB movement is too strong
if it's an asian guy with dyed hair maybe they're just a koreaboo or something
because usually it means they're part of a social group i have nothing to do with
that's interestingly specific lmao
dyed hair is cool but not on white guys
I'm not sure if it's bc I find that inherently attractive or if I think it's hot bc it shows they're comfortable in their sexuality / aren't afraid of being called feminine
like, earrings, cool style, painted nails kinda deal
I tend to be really into kinda unconventional-looking guys
what i find attractive about a guy:
- face
- hair
- general fitness
if you said the same list for guys I would be able to understand it but not sympathize with it
(maybe not as strongly as <@!173668455856340994> on the collarbone point)
sympathize with it too to a degree
see I can fully understand every point you made there
interesting
probably TMI but things about girls specifically I find the most attractive:
-abs, especially the line down the middle
-hands
-legs, especially toned calves
-collarbones
-boobs
-overall figure
damn another thing I'm struggling to explain
funny enough I think I might also be more into guys' asses than girls'
extreme moodkill is more like it
But still not my jam
Toned not excessive and bulbous
I think dudes in porn tend to have more attractive asses actually, imo
Ngl, personally not a huge fan of ass in general
https://old.reddit.com/r/Animemes/comments/h8bv9j/this_doesnt_please_the_nut/
does that gross you out?
straight guys don't wanna finish to a shot of another guy's ass
yeah that's one thing
I've heard some guys complain about that
my review on male gay porn is sometimes it's good but it's really hit or miss
idk going back to the original question like I'm not super picky about who the camera focuses on etc
the more girls the better right
i'm not surprised
> I don't watch male gay porn either
to elaborate on this though I don't think it'd be a turnoff
I'm pretty sure there were studies out there that found straight guys are just as likely to enjoy les as they do straight
do guys watch lesbian porn?
I don't watch male gay porn either
well for one gay porn is out
hence the jokes about looking on the 16th page of results
ok what do you look for
really?
cuz from a straight perspective you won't be okay with just any video on pornhub
I'm genuinely thinking so hard about this lmaoooo
like you're able to enjoy a wider variety of genres without getting turned off
which is still weird to me tbh
also apparently lesbian porn is the top category for women in general which means straight girls like it too
well there's not a lot of porn aimed at women in the first place
define "less picky"
oh that's interesting
are you less picky when it comes to porn because honestly that sounds like a major benefit of being bi
I'm open to answering questions about being bi if anyone has any in reverse lol
especially ones that guys can't seem to answer clearly
I'm opening to answering questions about guys
lemme figure out how to put some of them into words
anyway do you have more questions about being a straight girl
nah i get it
that sounds like a contradiction idk how to explain it right
I haven't lost interest but I haven't been really keeping up w it lately
i talk about it when you guys do, but otherwise i don't think about it
yeah at this point i don't even really subscribe to mbti anymore
few people are probably actually like that don't feel bad about it
*not being more like the flattering stereotype of your mbti type
that seems like a bit of a fallacy, like the whole point is that it's a broad categorization and very different people can be the same type
haha good point
but i'm more likely to blame myself for not being more like my mbti type which would solve my troubles
a deep conversation with the depth of a kiddie pool
ah yes i wish i could blame my mbti type for my troubles
we're having a deep conversation lol
see alan now you're getting it!
what is even happening anymore
damn
ok look blaming mbti for all my issues is easier than explaining all my internal conflicts, history, and worldview in a single sentence
yikes!
it's tried and true
um
wow
we're not that close yet
I think you bring it up more than we do these days
def not my college friends
infj stuff
why did this conversation suddenly take such a dark turn
I don't like having to ask who would actually look for me if I were to mysteriously disappear for a few days
I will attest that I'm bad at differentiating the two at times
this seems a bit oddly specific
there are some dudes that'll drive six hours to give you a gift on your birthday and some that'll only see you for food and alcohol
lol yeah
Some guys are friends, others are bros
also some people just suck in general
Or in all reality it's moreso the guys that keep me around
well some men just suck in general
some guys are terrible friends
The guys I keep around do
the right guys make good friends
can confirm
yes
@guys
do guys make good friends?
of course they make great friends so it's not entirely disingenuous
damn, idk how to respond to that
honestly sometimes i think my only motivation for wanting to date guys is to have a normal life, get married and not be lonely in the future

sorry for the derail
hire helen, work in shifts
continue though
she does morning slug rounds
ah, my mom would like you
oh i spent an evening deslugging my yard
but I don't think it's here
so I was searching for it
lol
realized I never actually got the context for why Helen renamed herself
wasn't paying attention to where I was typing
noah what the fuck was that LMAO
oh i don't feel bad about it I just think what you're describing is super pure
i think this id the difference between whether you're more sexual or romantic
i mean i'm sure it's very normal -- that's what it means to be sexual
I tend to think more watching Netflix with someone or simply chatting in a kitchen
oops!
Oops
yeah i'd also feel uncomfortable imagining having sex with someone
that's actually super fuckin wholesome wow
Maybe I'm to naive or idealistic
I Don't like to think about having sex with people cause I feel like I need consent for that
put a tag on that lewd shit jarrett good god
*wow, holding hands before  marriage???*
fucking disgusting
that's more like it
*god I wish I could hold her hand and take a walk with her*
i've never seen a person, real life or online, and thought about having sex with them, or wanted to
Not necessarily sexual
oh wait I'm stupid
Alternatively *god I wish I could do _____ to them*
do I want to ask what that means
jarrett confirmed M type
Almost never felt that way for a guy
My explanation of being straight is imagine you look at them and you think *god I wish they'd do _____ to me*
when i meet new people it's much easier to talk to a girl than a guy
(meanwhile, in Alan's anime watchlist)
that's so interesting
oh REALLY?
but some things i've noticed are i'm less likely to be interested in watching a movie/reading a story with only female main characters
i don't really have a broad statement on what it's like to be a straight girl
the best way I can put it is I love women bc women are amazing and I love men bc I love making terrible decisions
i think that makes sense
> hm are you more attracted to women than men then?
I'm starting to think so, but not by a ton
Rijhwani ‚ù§
lmfao
WHAT THE FUCK
As for my experience as a straight dude - after my breakup sophomore year I kinda told myself I wouldn't date until college so I wasn't looking for love of either sex but I can say I acknowledge that many ladies are attractive at least externally and I never paid attention to those qualities in other guys, but I love my homies and if I were to be gay for anyone it'd probably be Nick, not that I have anything against my other homies
hm are you more attracted to women than men then?
but also I feel like I almost understand straight guys better
ik i'm just also watching a movie about fantastical suicides
boys your input is valued as well
this is not a serious issue I am just so curious
it's ok take your time LMAO
i'm tryingggggg
even though she requested the perspective of a girl
right now we're trying to tell cindy what being straight is like
henleys are nice but we can argue college male fashion in the car later
Also Henleys are da wae
Hoods
*zipper hoodies*
With his
I don't like hoodies I like jackets
just keep finding more jeans and hoodies to mix it up
<@!110137446053736448> hoodies and jeans are your staples now
ok that made me laugh out loud thank u
it's not "how fuckable does he look" it's more "is his face shaped nicely" or "does he not dress like a crackhead"
Like me!
a lot of guys don't care/don't know much about fashion
like do some guys just never frame it that way? there's no way
mostly because of society's standard for all girls to try to be attractive
see that's why the statement confused me (and it was said by multiple male friends)
girls, regardless of sexuality are very good at identifying hotness in other girls
I think some of it is just not noticing details
I don't think attraction plays a role in detecting levels of hotness
i'm currently also watching a movie so let me think on this for a while
hmmmmmmmmm
either/and/or
good question! I don't know
are we talking about sexual or romantic attraction or both?
and I'm just like ??? really?
urk i'm not the best person to ask
a lot of straight boys I've talked to are like I couldn't tell you if a guy was hot or not
what IS it like to be a straight girl cuz I want info
hmm that's an interesting question
yeah
isn't there this thing that's like your sexuality can change a bit throughout your life too
bc women are incredible
especially as a girl
so what's it like to actually be straight
I assumed I was straight for most of my life but looking back there were a lot of signs
but that led me down the other train of thought of like
anyways right now I am feeling pretty gay and pretty confident in said bisexuality but it varies a lot day to day and honestly the memes about how that's just bi culture are very comforting
tbh I would say probably not
I don't know
cindy you're very bi
well are you more attracted to men than women?
ok I don't actually talk about this a ton but it's like half the time I question whether I'm actually bi or just making it up ~~even though I have literally slept with a girl~~ and it's funny bc I'm constantly second-guessing "am I just saying this for attention??" when most people don't know anyways so why would I think that
well just imagine some girl you're not sexually attracted to, then imagine all girls are her
oh are you asking about what it's like to be not sexually attracted to a certain gender
you can get along with them, love them, empathize and appreciate them just as well as any other, but you would never imagine anything romantic
what are we difficultly comprehending?
jkjkjk
that's genuinely difficult for me to comprehend
big think
sounds like what a closeted furry would say
that's it
but fr
lol
n o
what is this insinuating
cindy is a furry?
um
uh
huh what
> but also genuinely what is it like to be heterosexual @ the Straights of this server
imagine being just as sexually attracted to women as you are to dogs
> there are situations where men don't have contact with women i.e. in militaries so they have sex with each other as a replacement; i'd say they could identify as completely straight
even then I'd question it
well first you have to be sexual which i am not a great example of
hmm what is it like to be heterosexual
but idk how typical american men with lots of women around them can say they're straight if they choose to have sex with a man instead regularly
there are situations where men don't have contact with women i.e. in militaries so they have sex with each other as a replacement; i'd say they could identify as completely straight
but also genuinely what is it like to be heterosexual @ the Straights of this server
I went down a rabbit hole by searching "what's it like to be heterosexual" lmfao i can link a bunch other really interesting pieces if anyone's curious
but is queer
straight man married to a woman
i.e. disasterina from dragula
that is pretty interesting
^
you can identify as heteroflexible
but some people can't come to terms w it
i mean
I mean I say no
Can you really identify as straight
Who seeks sex from other guys
If you are a guy
Okay question
this is so interesting to me, idk if anyone else cares

this one's for you buddy
<@!173668455856340994>
I found it
O wait
sure but i can only stay for a few mins
lmao
i'm symbolically distancing from noah bc he immediately went to dicks
yo helen wanna come join me in vc i'm bored
if you take an average of multiple measurements that should be reasonably accurate
i mean your entire body's weight can also fluctuate dramatically from day to day
ah yes the weight of *hydraulics*
I also assume a dick's weight fluctuates too much to accurately weigh
i'm not making any recommendations
Just want to make sure I'm on the right track here
tf?
So what you're saying is that I should skin myself and replace my dick with a giant rolled up wad of skin
you don't even have to detach it from a cadaver
i feel like a dick would be the easiest organ to weigh
why are you asking me?
why do i date you ffs
and better question
why is that how your mind works
can't find a good answer sadly
why.
...
this made me google the average weight of a penis
lol idk how much other organs weight in comparison
i mean for such a big organ it's not that heavy actually
so if you're a thick-skinned person you'll weigh more, i see
skin is your biggest organ so i'm not surprised
yw for that bit of info
TIL a human skin suit would be ~10-11 pounds
but I'm top
down if you're down
Helen just really wants an orgy
with an orgy?
True
so basically if Cindy ever goes to a strip club she's sad and we need to cheer her up
> they don't have to be sad as well
I'm probably just projecting
it's not worth it
let's just have an orgy as soon as we can meet in person
don't drive to Portland though
i too am sad and horny
do not underestimate the power that horniness has on people
they don't have to be sad as well
hey they could just be horny
People are sad and horny and want to get out of the house and see real people
I'll be sad when I eventually have to see it go
I quite like my car
you don't have memories from in your car?
but hey wahtever works for people
but i cant see an angle for drive through strip clubs
is memories in that place
the argument i can make for dancing in a club while its close
just go dance in your living room
goes from an environment with atmosphere, food, and a show to a show
at which point go watch porn
it like dancing in a club alone while it's closed
short, lazy, and sloppy explanation then
but was lazy
was gonna type up an explanation
^
save you money
at that point just watch pron
i feel like being closxe to the dancers would be an important part fo the experience
Why?
this makes me question why people go to strip club even more
can I get a lapdance delivered to my home
This is so funny
Oh iforgot about it partway through this convo but
Course not
in this server
I dare you to find one
ever
I've never made a typo in my life
No need to flex
Look at mr perfect over here
just don't make mistakes lmao
guys it's easy
one: I type with a very not correct hand position (it's a weird normal/wasd/peck typing hybrid that came from videogames and CAD)
two: I keep a tea mug between me and the keyboard, so I can't actually see large parts of it
three: discord is always open on my left monitor so the keyboard isn't even in my field of view
four: my spelling is shit
üíÄüíÄüíÄ I can try
tell that to your border guard
Come to van :c
take me to dinner first
Fuck me
Udually
Autocorrect actually does a decent job of fixing my shit
actually ~~three~~ four things
I blame two things
But not this bad
I mean I usually make more errors on mobile
I don't have a reason
i also have a lot of typos due to switching to a new keyboard
so yeah, but that's what position as well I did, I appreciate that is people italicized

you're annoying for ever bringing it up at all
correction: annoyances directly caused by the bot himself
oh you're not annoying for bringing it up all the time
i also don't care about it
i don't know that
Helen and I know we're irritating for bringing it up all the time LMAO
the only way to address annoyances is to create more annoyances
Aren't all of the above features that address annoyances
but it's against starbot design heuristics to add features that address annoyances
(of course I could but I haven't been bothered to yet)
no that's impossible by all means
it has been 0 days since mbti was last brought up in this server

I find it more funny than genuinely annoying anyways

plus I turned off google ad personalization
lol I just use firefox permanently in "never remember history" mode for years now
cause it started for me after i looked something up but forgot to turn my browser dark
i mean that just tells me that noah doesnt pray with incognito mode on

I've been bugging you about this since I first saw your room
true, but I haven't had 5 years to try to bully her into improving it
i had to tiptoe in her room
her room was far worse
no but I think you should leave him alone
and if we're talking my Cindy
ever been to his room at his house
easy solution
yeah his dorm was fine can vouch
just dont bring girls to your room
but no dresser, or table
and you'll have a bed
well at least you'll never had to bring a girl back to your room and have her step on your bionicels by accident or trip over the driving alarm clock anymore
cannot believe you're still talking about this shit
I come back an hour later
i could probably empty my room down to the bare bones
biggest thing with my room is that I dont use like 80% of the things
you require things to mess up
that is true
you had nothing to get messy
Cindy Alan and Salina can confirm
my dorm was never messy
I will say though
its an absolute mess
not gonna lie
where else can it go
i mean
*nice*
yes
so on the floor
at the foot of my bed
where is the duffel bag?
yeah you got a point for lazy there
so
theyre still in a duffel bag
so
i took 100% of the clothes that i wear to UW
so to be perfectly honest
oh
no where are your current clothes stored
dont recall
or donated
im saying that they were thrown away cause i never wore them
I'm was asking where you store them
?
youd probably be limited to maybe a 6 of each type of outer garment
if we're talking clothes I actually wear
thrown away i think
um
where are the clothes now?
and a few stuffed animals
there is a nicely folded blanket
there are no longer clothes on that chair
hey
you put your clothes on a chair
its just the storage closet
i do have a closet already
in terms of your room
god if you get a dresser you may actually be elevated to "function person"
bed is coming in a week
well
ill show you in a bit
yup
wait you have a bed and cabinet now?
so some floor space has been saved up
for the bionicles
hey I have a cabinet in there now
plus it has looked like that since I first knew you
you didn't even have a room to take apart
I didn't
yea but it's not like you had to take your room apart to move into UW
hey i moved back in two weekends ago
<@!233062637922025472> back me up on this
because it looks like you moved in last weekend
probably because you can't do anything else in there now
i really just go in and sleep then leave when im done
which is sleep
i do one thing in that room
you know
i could
put it in the trophy cabinet corner
and the front has a window on the right side
so the entire backside is off limits
okay so the back has a closet and the door
actually have a room that doesn't look like you moved in last weekend
*move the things*
in a corner
with like 4 feet on the sides and like 6ft on the front and back
there are things to my right and left
i will lay in the geometric center of that room
bruh it's in the middle of the room
where else am i going to put it?
ummmm
please don't say you're gonna put it in the same place as the futon
which sits in the footprint of the futon
ok now you have a bed
bed?
the
well what is taking up all the room?
the mattress on the floor?
the chess trophies?
the bionicles?
the driving alarm clock?
the chair you use as a dresser?
so that's fun
good
and onto an actual bed
i am being forced off the futon
on a sidenote
for a table
get a desk/table
is not room
there
see lazy
i dont even have a table in there
bruh
idk "your room"
I've tried to convince him to move
where else can i be
hey
mostly router and stupidity/laziness
because "reasons"
why are you in the garage?
you can play pingpong with Alex though
yea, not surprised
cold as hell in here
yup
so porn isnt so far off
lol still in the garage
most artists have to draw nudes at some point
exhibit two are the drawings next to me
might as well draw porn
eh
so if youre already doing stuff like this as a hobby
your prof showed that to you guys?? lmao
Holy shit hahaha
from a hobby artist
im gonna answer this question with a sketch that was shown to us for my own drawing class as "something to inspire you"
you know
The stars align
And that they like drawing porn
And that they like porn
But then they learned that, well, porn sells
I know a lot of artists started off with it as a hobby, drawing fan arts and fan manga (called doujins) of their favorite anime
but like the porn industry is an Industry and I don't think hentai and animated porn is an exception
wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people start out w it as a hobby and become professionals
<@!173668455856340994> you even online?
<@!233062637922025472> thoughts?
like you spend years of your life developing this skill so people can jerk off to it
or are people really just learning these skills this just to make porn
like do professional artists and animators go home and be like "time to go make some more smut for the internet"
do people that draw hentai or do animated porn as a hobby learn that skill solely as a hobby or are they like professionals?
had a thought
struggling to sleep
why did it take you so long to think of this?
The tension between two people who are into each other and become step siblings is what I live for
esp if they knew each other beforehand
idk I don't have an issue w it if they're not actually related
looool
Is slightly degenerate
Which I'll say yes
Part of the plot is that they have just become stepsisters
I know why Noah said the name of the manga like that
You know
Oh

What's an example of a gay music video?
I bring this up because I literally spent hours watching gay music videos earlier today and just smiling nonstop (I'm aware that this is not a productive use of my time)
also also, I can't explain this but anything super gay makes me irrationally happy
not always
don't we all
also, noted, jarrett likes plot w his porn
<@!193229269076279298> explain
You know I dunno
lol
At least they're not dicking each other down chapter two
yeah but why did noah say it like that
The name of the manga
what's citrus
*bruh* I'm halfway done and they've kissed like twice
what fucking 4D chess is this
you're reading *Citrus*
bruh
Cause those usually devolve to straight smut immediately
I have never found a good gay men manga
Lesbians
Ah
out of curiosity gay men or lesbians?
It's one of the few ones out there with a good translation
by normal standards no
Well
by anime standards eh
hmmm
*romance* manga
*standard*
This is a very nice
Hey hey hey
I think you can find that other places than Fakku?
Quite good
Citrus btw
Probably gonna read a few more chapters of my gay manga then sleep
lmao
wasn't aware
*nice*
Yup
wait is this their Covid response?
Too easy to get caught up reading
Fun stuff with Fakku being free for a few weeks
Ah so I did it earlier today so that i could sleep earlier
<@!173668455856340994> is this pre or post sleeping wank?
Noah in shambles rn
speaking of which
no you have it backwards, whatever would be a bad idea normally is a good idea on this server
okay I was gonna elaborate but then I thought better of it  l o l
Fair enough
Hmm
^I think this is the answer?
overly sensitive "default" gag reflex?
At least in my experience
You gotta go pretty damn far back to gag
No but like
and idk just to Be Clean
it's not that far back?
Can I ask first why you're brushing your tongue that far back?
for the record I have not used this trick for anything besides brushing my tongue but I mean can confirm it is very effective
ok question does anyone know why gripping your thumb lessens your gag reflex?? like anatomically how tf does that work
fair enough
Pretty sure this is a few years old
yeah what noah said
she's hot but that lowkey pisses me off
waste of masks, everyone would be happier if she didn't have them
It could however belong in the fashion channel

Fuck biology
And now you‚Äôre taller than me
No you weren‚Äôt
No
I wasnt super tall in middle school
and are basing it on our current relative heights
Oh boy
maybe I just have a poor memory of the past
hmmmm now that I think about it though
Hm well that‚Äôs interesting

no
Am I just the 10%
Settle for what‚Äôs around
Resource availability?
Hahahhaha
but she pointed out that like 90% of the girls that i've been into have been under 5'4
but I tout all this stuff about tall girls and whatnot
Wow I regret some life choices

no no this isnt about you

You ever feel that you're in denial about what your type is?

Yes
Rip
cause I didn't feel like walking the extra 20ft
Basically instead of walking down a ramp that doubled back on itself to lose height I just jumped  over the edge
What did you jump off of?
"Don't jump off things"
Well that's my PSA for the day
Neither like sudden stops
But you know what it's also hard on, my balls
Yes the impact is hard on my knees
I just remember why I don't jump off things
To attain that superiority
That's what strap-ons are for
cause anyone can have ass or tits, but only men can have penis, therefore it is superior
I just came to the realization, this is correct
wtf

I really love the effort people put into some things

What does DLC stand for
Wait why do I love that that's hilarious
everyone loves a success story
which is basically a way to donate to the developer if you want
the first one has a DLC though
they're both free
I just realized
oh
obviously very different people
True subterfuge
but the second one is developed by "Yaluar01"
the developer of the first one is "Yaluar"
Oh boy am concerned
lol
First what???
managed to track down the first one
what???
Combat?
Weapons?

Do i look like corn starch to you?
idk, is cornstarch sharp?
Dont suppose you were working with sharp objects or anything
I would hope they're both held to a pretty high standard
Big shrug
Than surgical examination gloves?
Or something like that
Arent condoms held to a higher standard?
And how hard it was to notice until after it started leaking
The number or cuts and holes that got made just from putting them on/handling them
Why?
Using latex gloves today has greatly shaken my trust in latex condoms

biqtch pudding won s2, landon cider just won s3
I feel underaccomplished LMAO thanks for giving me a bunch of people to follow
yeah she's 24, won dragula when she was like 21/22
she's also like 25
Yikes but also woah

dragula presents alt drag really well
but the art and aesthetics are stunning
kinda toxic ngl
drag is a fun fun world

she's a nonproblematic queen unless you count the branjie shit

Wow

K E A N U 
she beat K E A N U for the award
but she was against celine dion and keanu reeves
she's hypeworthy for a canadian
eh
i don't think she deserved her people's choice award but
üòçü•∞
yes indeed
she's not my fave queen but she's great
Wait isn't she the Canadian one
basically brook lynn hytes is an amazing queen
Can't say I get everything you're talking about but glad you're excited. And yeah they're all hella talented
i agree my good bot dude
Lol
you shut up
sorry i'll shut up
roxxy and tkb both competed this year
i don't think tkb got the title yet either
and those are like the legendary pageant rugirls
not even roxxy andrews or alyssa edwards has got that title yet for normal comp
and ms continental
plus pro ballet dancer
holy shit that queen is polished
but brook lynn hytes is judging
idk how budget will be
DRUK is coming out
queen
Ok obviously Im not as into the drag world lol but I've been to 2 shows in the Vancouver area and this is my fave local queen
she also does aerial silks and is such an amazing performer and model
that
did
she
look at that motherfucking waist
L?
People who are Way more attractive than me in both genders should not be allowed. Damn.
generally it is indeed she/her
unless the queen specifies diff pronouns while in drag
some don't give a flipping fuck
+1 helpful
some are nonbinary
Good answer
most go by he/him
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
out of drag, whatever pronouns they prefer
in drag, she/her
We call them her/she
serving you motherfucking fish
So a dude
yes
Drag queen right?
answer
Question
miss fame is cool too but a lot of ppl prefer violet
the bitch is crazy
check out violet chachki
but yeah
camp tazo, the abh palette, netflix dance show, other shenanigans
man alyssa has been living the hustle
she's alyssa edward's drag daughter
she's gorgeous
No, I want you to step on me
and violet tbh
ngl i think you'd like plastique too
*immediately insta stalks* lmao
DAMNNNNN

it's a drag race quote!!!!
sALINA IM DECEASED
lmao
Imma use that saying <@!340319804747415553>
And trusting someone to hurt you but not hurt hurt you is really the highest level of that
And trust
Humans like safety
any hole is the goal
anyone else want to weigh in their thoughts
idk, pain and pleasure wires got a little tangled in the brain
try evolutionarily explaining masochism kinks
this can be broadened to "why do we as humans find literally anything other than straight up penis in vagina penetrative sex attractive"
and <@!503787499605458954> `men will stick their dicks anywhere that presents itself` I would agree, but with the modification `men will stick their dicks anywhere`
it doesn't need to present itself we will search it out
that is also true
hey there's no real reason for kissing either
partially because people are gay, partially because men will stick their dicks anywhere that presents itself, idk
like why as humans do we find the idea attractive
why use a different hole when there is a purpose designed one
same goes for anal
why are blowjobs a thing
ok question
but it sounds provocative
I'm not sure what that means
I deepthroated my gag reflex
That‚Äôs where all the bad breath comes from
You gotta brush your tongue right
The third
<@!472541429130854421>?
I can't tell if you're saying "as a result of practicing deepthroating my toothbrush, I have no gag reflex (which I wish to point out is the most common way people suggest to practice deepthroating)", or "as a result of deepthroating my toothbrush once I now have no gag reflex", or "I found out I have no gag reflex after deepthroating my toothbrush"
what
As a result I have no gag reflex
I‚Äôve deepthroated my toothbrush before
practice makes perfect
Correction: I have not yet deepthroated things
<@!193229269076279298> handcrafted chocolate dick
you will make someone sad
I don‚Äôt deepthroat things
context?
<@258094439636008971> you too
Oh sorry
... what???
So <@472541429130854421> what other things would you deepthroat?
reddit being helpful

damn, they're making hella $$$ off of this
I did not know booette was a thing and actually did just search it up and in the process discovered a gorgeous lesbian cosplay couple
Pornhub tags aint great
Where else can I reliably get Porn of only tall Asian girls?
Okay fine
it's out there
idk dude
just search up booette
Like damn where else can I get specifically Porn of Nintendo characters
Reddit as a Porn site is exceptional
the cat subreddits are just cause I like them
oh
it's literally just to send Salina stuff
he's obligated to follow cat subreddits
he's dating me
arent you allergic
cats!
cats?
I'd offer my advice, but my vast knowledge of reddit is limited to my specific *tastes*, engineering, cars, and cats
what
Huh I‚Äôve never heard of reddit being used  as a porn site
yeah i know lol
Welcome to reddit, everyone is a white straight male until proven otherwise
I will also say that reddit is still heavily male-dominated. one thing I've noticed is that even on subreddits that have to do with my own specific kinks everything is skewed towards the guy's perspective
Which are basically just subreddit gateways to all the other related subs
Or go to one of the content aggregation subreddits
Which is why you need to just use Google
Reddits search is so bad
Oh yea
reddit's search function kinda sucks
I both agree and disagree
I wish to say that reddit is the best porn site in the world, it was literally designed as a content aggregation site based on your specific interests
Like probably 100x more in content hours
yeah same
I certainly read a lot more than I watch
kidding, but in this context, it's true
Huh really?
moral of the story: women read more
oh yeah for sure
Like holy shit some of these people pump out like a book a month
But have you seen how much horny housewife erotica there is on Amazon
Also I wish to point out that people say most porn is made for men, and I would agree with that for video porn
That would make sense why video porn is so much more popular for men, lot more blood transfer going on
I just snorted out loud I love you
lmao
Blood not in brain I guess
I find it difficult to imagine anything while in the act
and I can't speak for helen but at least on my end my imagination is far more potent than any video
yeah ok that I can believe
But I haven‚Äôt in months
That‚Äôs just unrealistic
I didn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôve never watched porn before
`I don‚Äôt watch porn`
Uh
Idk why
Generally watching gay porn is extreme cringe to me
are you gonna tell us we've been naughty?
why is this still a convo
üëÄ
I could give a minor rant about a certain subreddits sorting system, but that's requires too much detail
Actively try to watch it, no
Come across it, yes
Not too keen on the "one guy plays the girl" style
Like they're either jacked or theyre like the femboy archetype which I dont like too much either
If you're gonna watch it the dudes are always really jacked or generally pretty unappealing to me
Reading it is much better
nice
And i have read
I have watched
just in general
most porn is cringey
I bet he‚Äôs seen it before but thought it was cringey
I'm taking that as a reluctant yes unless he comes back to correct me
I'm sad
I know
~silence~
ok out of curiosity do you as a straight dude ever watch/read guy-on-guy gay porn
how did I not know that
wait, you have a brother?
But i think having a brother ruined gay incest for me
no judgment I'm just entertained
LMAO
And i also get that I read a rather decent amount of incest doujins
throwback to our incest discussion
Like i get that they're not blood related
That and the Thor x Loki stuff
I've 100% discussed this with gene before but he's way too much of a greaseball for my taste
oh yeah tom hiddleston is a beautiful man but I don't get why so many girls freak out about loki tbh
And I still haven't found a reason as to why people want him in gay romamces so much
But they're really into Loki for some reason
There's that
I'm kinda not surprised that steve/tony is the most popular ship in marvel though. they have A Lot of really messy comic history, and the heterosexual relationships they got put into in the mcu actually don't have a lot backing em in comic canon
like I wonder if gay guys ever read this stuff and wince at inaccuracies in descriptions n shit
esp since the vast majority of writers are female
yeah I'm kinda curious as to why that's such a popular thing
loooool
And Tony x Cap isnt really my thing
I find that a big problem is that so many of the good writers out there are really into gay smut
Yeah it was a standalone
so yes I'm aware that sometimes the storyline is really good
it was about the aftermath of civil war if anyone was curious lmao
for context the first harry potter book is around 70k
one time I read a (not nsfw, for the record) marvel fanfic that was like 200k words or something like that
only 70 pages?
And then i gotta finish like a 70 page novel
The only problem is that sometimes the storyline is really good
I've made some forays into various fandoms out of curiosity, and some is actually very well-written, but often the communities themselves are terrifying, and the good stuff is like 2% of the content out there
I'm not big on fanfic
Especially for fan fiction
Book Porn is pretty good
But anyways
In all fairness I read the whole Tao Te Ching
i have jesus in my heart
but yes
it's why i was able to slack off heavily in wr at the end of the yr
look i was bored over a summer
damn
yes
the entire thing???????
fuck off
and i've read it
i have a bible
lmao
If you need one I got three
Pick up a bible Salina
üòâ
byeeeeee
back to reading nursing textbooks about marital bliss
just words
Just words or?
ok that's my cue to leave
I'm in the mood to overshare so like. I tend to like reading porn a lot more
it's still a thing but very very occasional
to be fair I don't watch porn very *often*
er ok
I'm not gonna elaborate lmao
whatdya mean
listen,
called out
damn
I feel like that's probably not true
really??
I don‚Äôt watch porn
Either that of she has to shell out her porn stash/links
lmao
I suggest we burn <@472541429130854421> at the airbnb
The true mark of friendship is sharing your porn
Sharing is caring
There's nothing shameful about sharing
It‚Äôs not gonna be me üòã
someone needs to burn
Who said I would ever play fair
<:NR:605639306572464128> that's cheating
I only made up the ‚Äúmaterial used‚Äù sections
I know that one was a joke
I can't tell if you're joking about masturbating or about the filled in information
Would you seriously believe I get off to War and Peace
I mean you just have to look at my previous entry
-_-
Got nothing interesting to put there
Nah tbh I fibbed the last two
<@472541429130854421>
Going stronger than the first two days though
I've got 7 now
You seem to have given up
Yes, but Jiayi seems to still be trying after he failed
And Jiayi hasn't inputted 2 days
For this month we're both at five
Wait
Equal to 32 nuts in 18 days
For the rest of the month
To equal jiayis last year total I will need to average 1.777 per day
Well you're competing against this year's Jiayi
I am at 5:12
That was a ratio of 37:30 nuts:days
Damn
Yes
Last nnn?
As of currently I am at 0.416 per day
But consider that jiayi averaged 1.23 per day
Maybe this year
You're gonna beat Jiayi
Bruh
<@!173668455856340994> <@!233062637922025472> you two have just given up haven't you -_-
There are roles???
everybody wins
you'll be able to move things with your mind in a few days
ill live
But don't worry you won't be alive next year, not if I have my way
Next year
Next year Jarrett
i control the dopamine now
have fun
yeah
<@!173668455856340994>
yes
it certainly looks like it
noah did you make the nnn roles? lmao
Usually I prefer a little more shoulder though
A fellow shoulder man
The shoulder detail seems pretty customized lol
<@!233062637922025472> how are you holding up?
not my work, reddit copy pasta
I applaud your literary skills. Truly a work of art
THIS IS SO FUCKING FUNNY oml
The last break that was this long I was at a Christian summer camp
Rip?
I spent so long charging up it was practically a supermove
Man
Also the 11 lmao
Not once but twice
You broke hard
Man
10 days is my longest break in two years
Let‚Äôs go again
He caved and then was like
You should be
I'm disappointed in you
<@173668455856340994>
Oh WOW
My will is weak
I'm sorry Noah
Jarrett, I need you to verify the accuracy of this statement
`I saw exactly 1.09441 square inches of a girl's shoulder today.I immediately fell to my knees, as the rush of dopamine signaling my impending earth-shattering orgasm started making me moan loud enough to deafen everyone in the immediate vicinity. What followed was a torrential downpour of every single sperm cell I ever have or ever will produce, shot out so hard that my dick was ripped apart by my √ºbernut accelerating to 5% the speed of light by the time it left my urethra. It vaporized the girl as it punched right through her, barely slowed, before cutting through a structural support beam in the school as if it were a nuclear-powered angle grinder. The sheer weight of this historical nut, combined with the total destruction of everything in its path, caused the school to collapse, and every female in the state of Illinois to fall pregnant with my children. When the final death toll was tallied, there were 146 deaths, 458 injuries, and over 4 million pregnancies. As I lay dying under the rubble of my high school, I rest easy, knowing every one of my sons will repeat my glorious actions. Goodbye.`
Dick destroying
That‚Äôs a lot of...
I'm proud of you
Made it further in ddd than nnn last year
Ah yes
rip their roommates
you all should do destroy dick december
Or descriptions
Or just go look for it again
then do your best to fill out what it was
What if I can no longer find the materials
and <@!472541429130854421> finish filling out the questions
also people fill out the sheet
what is the longest porn movie ever made
I have a question now
ok
ballsy
it's a month long edge
Rip?
Jarrett gets major props from me for stopping the first night that's Commitment
Idr what his score was last year
Jiayi: most improved player
Jiayi and Helen are second class citizens now
nope
+Helen kinda
People with self control: Cindy, Noah, Salina, Jarrett
competition is just a very strong motivator
I will finish when I want to finish
the goal is to have self control
the goal is not to be the longest lasting guy
no
Or encourage him to give in so you can claim the title of longest lasting guy lmao
Alternatively you could both give up
I'm struggling too, but don't give in
This is unhealthy peer pressure
I have just removed them
speaking of which
Alan and Gene don't count because they're not doing anything
you're the last guy one the list other than me
In another week some of them shoulders are gonna look mighty tempting
bruh stop looking at it then
I dunno if I can keep this up
Gay trap catgirl Porn is looking mighty fine right now
Bruh
then who am I competing with
<@!173668455856340994> don't you dare give in
she is correct
The key is depression
Depression
Yeah how tf did you manage this Noah?
Spicy
It was some gay trap stuff too
I was reading some doujins earlier just because I missed it
Close call today but I‚Äôm fine
Just fine
How's nnn going for everyone
Let alone 5 times
I would be quite upset of someone stopped me once
Cant you just tell him when you're gonna be back or something?
Forgot
O shit
also yes
we don't have a private bathroom
I guess you stay up pretty late though
Hmm
I mean there's a bathroom
Well that's what I was doing
uh you mean when I'm in the room?
Why doesnt he just do it at night?
my projects are in my room
no
lol
for most cockblocks chained together
Go back to your room less out of consideration for him haha
so far my record is 5 days
I have the mystical power to always return before he does
no it's because he never gets to finish
And damn your roommate is even more active than I am
that does no bode well
I'll update the chart today
Gene and Alen really gotta fil out their chart
I swear I'm gonna break it sometime
so I'll come back and try to open the door only to smash into the chain
the man feels too secure jacking it now that he can just set the chain
I've "walked in" on my roommate about 5 (6?) times this week already
that would help
ah yes
And being more tired than usual
Having a roomate helps
It's been quite a lot easier for me this year
I think something about not being depressed this year has to do with it
<@!173668455856340994> you know this year is much harder than last year
for a real test wouldn't you have to have something to compare it to
<@340319804747415553> is it okay if I take your role for a bit?
Is that a volunteer I spot?
Idk, but the best why to find out is testing it
Scambling your dick
Or would I just be better at like
But would that actually increase my skill?
Pass
Gene I volunteer you
Lol
we need to test this
Geez
So I can probably give the most quality footjobs out of anyone here
I can solve a rubiks cube with my feet
On the topic of footjobs
Hmmm
Enjoy wrapping your head around that
Yw
I'm confused as to what this implies, but I am concerned as to whether I want to know or not
Fuck off mate
Already done
You need many, many trials to run a proper experiment
That‚Äôs already been tested
Good lord Gene
Would you want to test that theory? ;)
You say "some people" like you don't, Noah
well some people enjoy sucking dick
I imagine it would be the same for a footjob
"Sucking your own dick feels more like sucking dick than getting your dick sucked"
What was the saying
I would say probably yes
Comfortable? Probably not.
Could one conceivably give themselves a comfortable foot job?
So like
It‚Äôs not Halloween anymore üò∞
ywyw
NUUUUUUUUUUUU üò±

Haha thanks
good luck

jkjkjk
and whose heart did you break
whose room did you set on fire
helegg
...
Oh how my life has changed
There have been two major incidents in my friend group and I have been at the crux of both of them
oh boyyyy
Maybe tomorrow
Too busy dealing with drama
well you can fix it now, and while you're at it answer the 4th question
Your fault for making the question unclear
the question is will you be carrying on with nnn, not will you continue masturbating
<@!472541429130854421> you also answered the last question wrong
I thought that was a turtle for a good 15 seconds
<@!472541429130854421> don't bitch out on us like that
oh shitttt
God dammit lmao
I'm
7 or 8 break days
after 7 or 8?
After 7 or 8 i think it goes back a year
... oh boy
Good stuff
The last time I took a 3+ day break was July 21st 2019 - July 24th 2019
which is fair
in his restraint, I suppose
you don't believe what?
sorry dude
i don't believeeeeeeee
Must've been the longest break in a month or two
go jiayi go I believe
lol
oh my gosh
I'm actually impressed with myself
Oh shit that's actually 3 days in a row
Praise be
<3
<4
yes
Yes
Are you proud of me
I'm proud of you
That's 2 days in a row
<@193229269076279298>
I survived today Noah
Let‚Äôs find out who masturbates in the library stacks
You know what could be spicy? If you add ‚Äúlocation‚Äù to the offense form
did you fail THREE times already?
wait jiayi
:(
either they're all right or theyre all wrong

Love you Noah ‚ù§
You‚Äôre gonna trust webmd on this???
confirmed
https://pets.webmd.com/cats/features/cat-body-language#1
I verify nothing
Nope
No I just want you to verify the car fact part
I love you but not enough to do that
No I‚Äôm not verifying it for your wanking analogy
What
<@!340319804747415553> verify my cat facts
yes
like cats and closing their eyes, masturbation means I'm safe
like you get used to "masturbation means that everything is done"
it's largely because your body is accustomed to it too
i understand you
<@!173668455856340994> thoughts
someone else should though
well I shouldn't
I should write a thesis on this
it's like your body gets all worked up and you can't shake the feeling even if the thing that caused it is gone
but your body also doesn't really seem to have a "memory" for how it was feeling before the current emotion
so when you're stressed out and masturbate you hit that dopamine high, then it quickly drops off
but your body doesn't "remember" that it was stressed so you just return to your normal baseline
and since the thing that caused the stress in the first place was resolved, you just couldn't shake the feeling
you just stay at that baseline and can continue on with your life
so I'm like "this would be a great time to masturbate to get rid of the strees", but sadly it's nnn
and now even though it's in and I'm pretty happy with it, I still feel stressed
but it took me like 8hrs to write today, and I got up at 12:00
so basically I've just been "on" and working on it all day
so I just turned in my essay, 3hrs to spare so I was fine
I just came to a realization
it's pretty easy to not be tempted while looking at these if you're critiquing them as an art form
hmm
but it definitely does fit well with the storyline
it's getting a little too close to the cutesy style for my taste
hmmmm that's true
Artstyle is fine to me, charming and cute, captured the esssence of the story
this is so cursed
i need a purifying hug
i don't like thissss
honestly i should keep a running list of my top 10
I want the Jarrett hentai review show
but the artstyle wasnt really super good
nice premise
I looked at number two for a while
my poor innocent eyes
what is happening
#2 was amazing
number 2 and 3 are pretty good
It's what it calculated for last year's November
is that what the list currently calculates as your avg?
Will try to limit, I'll cut down my daily average per month from 1.23 to 0.73
that will be interesting
now ddd
that's all we ask
*try*
I definitely expect at least 25 offenses by the end of this
that's what a bathroom is for
ah
My roommate's back for the night and I'm not fapping while he's in the room
today isn't over yet
I can probably manage every other day or every 3 days
Well I've survived today
then you only have to fill out 6 total
<@!233062637922025472> how about trying to limit it to like every 5 days at most
K done
-_-
had time is a solid reason
lol
are you even trying
opened a few to many accidentaly
bruh
"Bored in the morning"
"Had time"
ah yeah
so idk
but Gabe doesn't have access
I'd say it was you or Gabe
cause each offense is its own separate event
though does sound like something I'd do
not me
So by the end of this month I gotta write like 30 of these?
that is the idea
yes
Do I fill one out for every single fap?
Okay so for the offenses
my guess is <@!478706068223164416>
I think one of us has a bunch of bot accounts going
ok most of them just left all at once
is someone botting with multiple accounts?
idk
Who are these anonymous idle people?
Yeah that's strange haha, opened it and didn't expect to see so many people
why do we all of a sudden have 14 viewers?
uh
you gonna fill yours out?
<@!233062637922025472>
"i just put anyone who regularly ~~uses this chat~~ beats their meat like it owes them money"
i just put anyone who regularly uses this chat
Idk, Jarrett put you on there

I feel like linking the material is punishment emough
no
other than public shame for failing
Are there penalties?
The offense form
Lmao
@everyone
fill out your spot people

Scuze me Gene
LMAO
:/
i think the only reasonable solution here is a foursome between me, noah, alan, and jarrett
but i don't deny that it is something i would say
i claim innocence
yikes
I left my laptop unattended for two seconds
it was Gene
this is uholy
i need to be cleansed
oh my god
JARRETT NOT YOU TOO
*slorp*
ALAN
also why does that sound like gene
get your filthy mouth off of him
oh my GOD
<@!193229269076279298> lemme slorp up that thicc dick
<@!193229269076279298> sure thing id love to
just wanted to point out that it'd be funny
no lol it's fine
would "I love you bro" be better?
I guarantee you that I would say it far less to an SO
smh
friends can say i love you
<@478706068223164416> can you suck my dick again
> I love you
You know, misunderstandings could occur if they randomly saw someone had texted me "I love you" from my notifications
What the fuck?
Chester Cheetah aint it
Tony the Tiger sure
what
This is far more information than anyone asked for
Most of this took place across reddit and Twitter
I forgot if he was for or against
I know the cheeto lion was also involved in the thing too somehow
<@!478706068223164416> I love you
LOL
stop it. get some help.
I think it started when the frosted flake lion asked people to stop drawing furry porn of him
and the amount of people who want to get off to dota is much much much less than the people wanting to get off to league characters
So people just rolled with it
The Wendy's thing started as a meme then their official Twitter was far to ok with it
or doujins either for that matter
the artstyle doesnt conform as much to porn
and Noah dota porn is much, much worse except for some fanarts
dont need to see Gwen from Ben 10 taking it up the ass
i just
and its not even bad stuff usually
overwatch, league of legends, legend of zelda, teen titans, samus, harry potter, the wendys girl for some reason
League generally has pretty high quality
Jarrett what's the quality on DOTA porn?
Hey don't shame the man
oh god
lmao
pokemon porn
wdym?
but he doesnt have the same qualms about ruining stuff as i do
he's into 70% similar stuff to me so that's nice
I do feel like I have a decent number of pretty specific kinks but I also don't think any are uncommon
#deceivingnames
how's your pornbro doing
ok not feet
...........
or just noah
its all good to share porn until someone is into feet
answer: nothing
lol
only problem is i dunno what stuff yall are into
jkjk
no sharing, noah
what?
nope nope
...
if all goes well yall fail a whole bunch and give me good material to look at
ack
but she also doesn't post slides.......
she doesn't take attendance
hoooonestly I might skip sociology anyways
bask in the procrastination
no
I can't skip classes to study tomorrow bc I already skipped friday classes last week for the climate strike
I have like 3? 4? more chapters to get through + a practice exam
help I've resorted to discussing my sex life as an alternative to reading this goddamn textbook
like I've said a bunch of times that I'm a pretty occasional partier and even more occasional slut
besides it's not a big part of my life to begin with
ah
as far as nnn goes
?
yeah for me it's more like I'm petty and don't wanna lose lmaoooo
well, good for her
oh
not much more to it
basically with partying and sex things got a little out of hand in her opinion so she cut back on the partying and went full abstinence
explain the abstinence thing
ok but
gotta make up for going to BC
I was *very* social in JSA
.......who I never could decide if I actually liked or not
i.e. Quinna
strangely I think you hung out w certain people way more than I did
she brought it up quite a bit
no
wait you never talked with her about her whole abstinence thing?
I'm not sure if I should be honored or concerned
damn
really?????????
campbell
who's sophia
you sound like Sophia
so abstinence it is I suppose
so that's why it's there
imo no sex > sad sex
also the offense format is inspired by helping Jarrett maintain his personal list
so that's like, 2-3 opportunities that I'll be passing up? idrc
and my parents are visiting last weekend
no? but like I'm not actually fucking people every night or anything like that lol
"oh boy it's sex month"
"hmm do I feel like sleeping with people this month"
is this like a monthly decision?
ah
oh lol nah I was gonna say I'm prob just not gonna sleep w people this month then
`just make sure not to finish`
`honestly... don't think that will be that hard`
what do you think I'm gonna say
really?
I know what you're gonna say
don't say it
honestly
just make sure not to finish
sure why not
do you want a link to their insta or what
actually have sex
ok but what if I like
LMFAO
offense #1 (date)
offense #1 (time)
offense #1 (reason)
offense #1 (material used (link))
offense #1 (pleasure level (0 - 10))
offense #1 (will you be carrying on?)
"O" stands for a successful pass of a day                            
"X" stands for a single failure during a day                            
Each "X" must have a corresponding offense form filled out                            
Upon successful completion of nnn your final task is to fill out a "celebration form" in the same format as an offense form
few new rules this time around
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WlAboPLoCBLWBmH316yQ4CDEJKc1xekmF4vO1kuaBfM/edit?usp=sharing
ok the sheet is completed
that's crazy
I have less than a month of class left
yep
holy shit, it's november
nice work Jarrett
lol
oh
he didn't nut
i just flat stopped
no no
better start filling out your form then
rip
oh
have fun
...
but i have self control
didnt make it in time
ah not quite
when you've already failed in the first minute
sad life
whelp
Fuck
geez
new for this time
looool
sec
shit
like in 5 minutes
you got 6 mins
does tonight count
for failure?
wait
just prepping
you can't already have an x
<@!173668455856340994> it hasn't started yet
LMAO
damn this is actually gonna take some effort this year huh
gonna come up with a format quickly
ok done
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WlAboPLoCBLWBmH316yQ4CDEJKc1xekmF4vO1kuaBfM/edit?usp=sharing
Will create one right now
No not yet
<@!193229269076279298> do we have a nnn sheet?
Woo vaccines
This year was like the first time I ever voluntarily got a flu shot
My parents have a lot of stories of 5 year old me screaming and fighting the doctors
Yeah needles are p much the only legit irrational fear I've got
Yikes
not the needle but the medicine itself
and humira is by far the most painful medicine I have ever taken
the orange one was the first arthritis medication I ever took
both of them I hate the sight of
and these
Humira needles
which some exceptions
needles for me for the most part have passed into the idk category
really?
Like when I got teeth pulled when I was younger I refused injections bc needles freak me out
I actually don't think I've ever been on painkillers stronger than like. Ibuprofen and laughing gas if that counts
you just don't care
na that's the best part about morphine
I strongly dislike feeling out of control
it's what I would describe as a very "fun" drug, but not a sustainable one
Laughing gas is a no for me fam
laughing gas is kinda in-between
morphine is something I would be extremely happy to do 24/7
If it actually made me more productive I could 100% see myself getting hooked
Exactly why I will prob never try Adderall
alcohol is great and all but I wouldn't be happy feeling that way all the time
don't do drugs you would want to do all the time
My pro tip on drugs
yea well Mason certainly could afford to question his life choices
Very much not my thing but hey at least I know now I guess
Honestly weed kinda did for me lmao
actually quite the opposite
I can tell you morphine certainly doesn't make you question your life
Also one of the drugs I'm most scared of
Not gonna lie one of the drugs I'm most curious about
Have you tried Adderall?
Adderall, but if Adderall made you question your life choices
not all drugs feel good
oh no I'm not saying it's great, I'm just saying the effect has a drug like impact on your body and mind
Because the immediate feeling tends to be overwhelming regret
Imo post-nut clarity aint even that great
Also
you shouldn have stopped after the first
yea cause it only should take one
Just as each nut per day is worse than the last, each post-nut clarity is worse than the last too
Okay but
you think that, but then if you actually tried it
you saying `Booooo` to me saying after the first time you'd stop is like that one reporter that took heroin to see what it was like thinking he wouldn't get addicted
Lol
in my professional opinion post nut clarity should definitely be classified as a drug
Booooo
see the problem is you'd start with that in mind, but after you finish the first time you're gonna go "uh what was I thinking" and then stop
Idk I totally would as a guy just out of curiosity
Oh that's shorter than I thought
never really tired to "push the limits"
15 - 20 mins is my best guess
idk, if you got all the time in the world why push it
No impending nnn no hot partner waiting on you
Well ok say you're in like a normal/relaxed state of mind
`depends on how much you want it`
What's an avg refractory period for a guy at this age
Go look it up
Hydrodynamic Bearing
And how much pain you can endure
depends on how much you want it
8 - 12?
How many times can you get off in four hours ü§î
Well ya best get your last minute kicks in.
No it's November oppressing us all
self pity
i believe we call that...
men oppressing men
thats a new one
Hey we're all equally oppressed here
that's called patriarchal oppression
And it also counts for girls too
no nutting
well then
what if i want a birthday treat tho üò¶
Well technically you're also not allowed to nut from sex either
idk what else to tell ya
it is what is sounds like bud
......what
welcome to mainstream entertainment
basically
it's a challenge to not wank
no nut november
what's nnn?
Yes
LMAO
I got the notification for this and another channel where you said ‚ÄúYes‚Äù so I thought you just answered yourself
@everyone so we gonna do nnn?
It's a trilogy, there's three books
"It's not gay if it's a man and a dinosaur"
He orgasming though a back massage?
That cover
My roommate
Twice
Not once
You Just ruined his day man
Omg wow
and I just listen to him swearing for 30 seconds until he opens the door
so the door only opens like 3 inches before it stops
well technically I told him to just put the chain on the door when he is, so I just come back and try to open the door and hit the chain
Did you make him stop the first time?
Also man
Who just jerks off in the open like that?
well I've walked in on my roommate jerking it twice today
so are we gonna do it agian?
Jiayi can, I can't
Are you planning on making a new record this year?
pretty bad
don't talk about it
we
How far negative was my nnn score last year again?
Rip music I guess
Do you need subtitles for this to work?
Watching a Jackie Chan movie
Couldn't find subtitles
Not watching legally blonde or the running man
O yeah speaking of movies
NOOOOooooo
Solid top ten for me
>:(
<:(
:(
NOT NOW
NOT EVER
A very good movie
I DONT TRUST YOUR MOVIES
:(
NO
we should watch it together some time
very good movie
get out
you don't matter
I'm a new addition
Hey now
woo
this group has been around for more than a year now
also wow
are we gonna do nnn again his year
so people
max out that 401k and IRA when you start your first job
it's really worth it
save early people
of 200,000 at 30 is 3.5 million at 60 (for an average index fund)
1 million at 50 is 2.6 million at 60 (for an average index fund)
buy a sex dungeon? noted
when it come to retirement
I just wish to point out
that's quite good for 12 year straight
*compounding
*average
almost ~13.5% per year
lol
now that's good investing
the land made 4.21 million a year
imagine having an office you knew was formerly used for shooting bdsm scenes
so the land was probably making them more money than their porn was
I'm still disappointed though
I'm sure they made money
yeah, but they also restored it
they only bought it for 14.5
booooooooooo
that would be it
ah
not sure why though
I was also aware through reddit that it was being sold
tbh I do think america has become more open about its kinks in recent years
but yea
it's in the intro apparently (this sounds like the "my friend wanted to know")
Make america kinky again
Damn
lol
this photo
I was peripherally aware of the armory for years, reddit likes to post that photo I sent in snap and make jokes about it
rip?
not sure why
the place is shutting down I know
anyway
if you all want we can just make a short video posting channel
no idea why we have that group in the first place
soild
https://youtu.be/SGWkB6Hy4jI <@478706068223164416>
I like variation of texture
you like chunky
ok this is false
I know good peanut butter when I see it
Penis brothering at its finest
Yep
and also better things to do with my time
<@!258094439636008971> come back I need a reaction
me @ gene & alan
aight get ready I have to send these one at a time bc discord is stupid sometimes
I have many strangely relevant marvel memes for this
wait omg
"Nice cock bro"
Penis fencing
*penis envy*
honestly I find the "brother" part at least mildly concerning but you do you
he had penis envy of alan's dick
He's my penis brother
penis envy
was this brought on by something specific or are you just horny
<@478706068223164416> penis brother
Climb that girl like a jungle gym
Oh hell yeah
asian amazon huh
damn
<@173668455856340994> this u
Hahaha
Nice
you can't do that with "other things"
your throat can squish food into a smaller diameter but longer length, thereby maintain the same volume
that's pretty different though
I mean nsfw shit aside your throat can fit a pretty solid amount of food
why don't you go first
idk you tell me
what is the maximum dilatation of someone's throat?
new question
...because you wound someone's body around a shaft
but it basically looks like wound someone body around a shaft
I can post photos
lathe accidents are generally the worst
but spend enough time in shops and stuff does
not yet
damn anything particularly gory?
I actually feel like I'd have a decent chance of winning it... from shop accidents
keeping a list of the most nsfw thing you've seen at collage and then rank everyone's best one to see who wins at the end of 4 years
hmm I just thought of something
Lol
You tell me, Not-At-Wallmart Jiayi
Why is Walmart Jiayi in nsfw chat
Walmart Jiayi lmaooooo
What title?
Lmao?
I dont need a dakimura of Wal-Mart jiayi
<@!520095106888630348> I contest that title
Get a daki of your roommate
Lmao

(or get a body pillow cover)
fuck the roommate
But theoretically might that someone's roomate think that that person is a complete wacko?
I know you own an anime body pillow
bring it to college with you
Asking for a friend
So theoretically if one owned an anime body pillow and was moving into a college down in 5 days, where might one theoretically store it?
Hahahaha
I thought I was gonna be able to use the Spider-Man pointing meme, but I'm ok with this outcome too

NOAH I'M DECASED I JUST NOTICED THAT
If we're being honest, that scene was one of the only redeeming qualities to that awful show
*nice*
Damn it Kuzu no Honkai
he looks eerily similar to one of my friends in cali
I was not expecting that
he looks so different
.....

Tony Hawk, senior high school photo
who is that
would bang
"donor"
Lmao
"Hello friends, would you like to be in a photoshoot with me?"
reddit is finding all the interesting shit today
`Ashkan Sahihi is an Iranian photographer known for unique photographic projects that include a series of armpits, another of facial expressions of drug users just after using them, or the one we bring here today and that is possibly the most striking of all: faces Ejaculated with real sperm . In an interview he was asked what was probably in your mind: ‚Äúwho were the models, and who were the‚Ä¶ donors? to which he replied ‚Äúfriends and acquaintances that I invited for the project. During the conversation, I made it clear that the donor should be his current partner. ‚Äù`
https://www.orgasmatrix.com/ashkan-sahihi-cumshots/
I mean yea
you know it was a lot funnier reading about the crazed ramblings of a long dead man, than reading something that people in political office like to follow
`In a leaked email sent by Bannon in March 2016, he told Milo Yiannopoulos, "I do appreciate any piece that mentions Evola."`
`Donald Trump's former chief adviser Steve Bannon has pointed to Evola's influence on the Eurasianism movement`
oh shit
`He wrote a number of books and articles on sex magic`
`A keen mountaineer, Evola described the experience as a source of revelatory spiritual experiences.` <@!503787499605458954> you guys shared some common interests
`He wrote that "as a rule, nothing stirs a man more than feeling the woman utterly exhausted beneath his own hostile rapture."`
`he was a proponent of the M√§nnerbund concept as a model for his proposed ultra-fascist "Order"`
`Evola denied being a fascist and instead referred to himself as a "superfascist"`
my roommate just showed me this guy
yikes!
when is a better time to do drugs than when surrounded my thousands of strangers
ah concert people
https://old.reddit.com/r/whitepeoplegifs/comments/czic07/kids_today_with_their_butt_drugs_and_concerts/
Like discord
That's a lot of text based things you can open
Yep
i think it's like 500 mb idr
yeah but like really limited data
Most people do
she has limited data
Including data?
My phone plan costs only $5 a month
Intresting idea
Ah
I'm in a limited phone plan so second one gives me extra 250 mb for free
One is for data
Why?
Yeah
Also two sim cards?
*based on your previous search history*
???
What the fuck, Gene
When I get home, I'm gonna roll myself up into a burrito and just lie down for a few days
I promise I'll be normal by morning
It's one of those outbursts of being weird again
I am sorry
You're welcome
I am very well aware that no one asked
God dammit Discord character limit
(I just needed a neutral channel to spam and this the first thing that caught my eye that didn't have something going on in it, so just play along with the excuse)
So the following scream is probably nsfw because it is quite possibly lethal
That shit gets bottled up and is probably enough to deafen someone at this point
And y'all know how I yell really loudly?
In like a long time
Loudly in public
Scream
So I haven't been able to like
Konky
I'm so confused but ok lol
oh this is also part of the ubc vs. ucb confessions competition where everyone guesses whether it was sent to canada or cali lol
THIS GROUP IS SO FUCKING FUNNY ASFKJAL; I can't stop scrolling oh god
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
but there's a FUCK ton of characters so
I actually don't know who that is
Ok, you guys win. Let's stop now.
<@503787499605458954> you're the marvel expert
Is it like the og comic design for one of the characters?
The belt really confuses me
I don't recognize the character
Thanos anally fisting who?
Ah there's some higher quality stuff too
Yike
I knew I could count on you
Nice work <@173668455856340994>
.......................oh
I almost missed one of them, but then I realized it was because I typed in "Tom Holland" instead of "Spider-Man"
more than 5
I was already sore idk why I did this
bro I know I've said this like 5 times now but my GOD my abs hurt like a BITCH
no
lol is anyone surprised
never watched the movie
didn't get antman
https://www.buzzfeed.com/ilovemarvel3000/can-you-guess-the-mcu-hotties-from-these-zoomed-in-d4kx0arv3y?bfsource=bfocompareon&bfsource=bfocompareon
send the quiz over
"did great"
im so bored
dicktures
"A mixture of various dicktures"
"I need my weekly fixture of dicktures"
why not refer to sex as "docking"
Think of how many possibilities this opens up
I mean
I'd be willing to consider that, but I'm still voting in favor of dicktures
Peenctures
Or that
Penis pictures?
Dicktures
Do we not refer to dick pics as
Why the fuck
Guys, I'm just now having this epiphany
ok i can't find a gif but that reminds me of
https://www.tvfanatic.com/quotes/why-are-you-sleeping-in-our-tub-the-porcelain-keeps-the-suit/
bc his roommate is really shitty
actually definitely chill, she invited one of our other friends to crash on her couch
and a ton of fun
probably fine she's super chill
also how chill would they be with the orgy
how chill would they be with guys sleeping in there?
crossing the border doesn't cost $$, just time since none of yall probably have nexus cards
so I really don't think it would be v expensive for yall to come up
also I've realized that food here is generally cheaper than in the states, which I was not expecting
oh yeah I have a hiking sleeping pad with me
sleeping in a bathtub is a legit thing
inflatable mattresses
I'll sleep in the shower
couches
so if she were willing to take a few of you that might actually work
with like a living room and full kitchen and everything
one of my best friends here has a 4-person suite
lmaooo
"Ten People, One Dorm: This is Their Story"
coming soon
no one cares
oh and it's a co-ed floor
we have a private bathroom and I'm good w sleeping on the floor
if anyone ever wants to come up alone they can literally just pay bus/train ticket and live in my room for a few days
1. i am uncomfortable being rated and compared to other people
2. i don't trust alan with anything on principle
someone could stay with me if they wanted
he drove every time we went hiking bc he has an suv
he's actually a good driver, I promise
take alan's van
also PLEASE COME SEE ME it'd be hella lit!!
it's not that weird
someone asked and he looked at pics
Remembering one's shoulders is not much different than remembering their hairstyle
do you have a problem with the rating existing or the fact we all know the rating?
but i hate that with every fiber of my being
tbh i am a lil too
I'm lost
i did not ask to be included in this
because you asked for it
why are you shaming us for Jarrett remembering what your shoulders look like?
because why does he remember what my shoulders look like
why?
i'm not shaming jarrett i'm shaming you all
why?
so gross
that's
we were poking and prodding about his shoulder fetish, and we wanted him to rate everyone
that is legit more horrifying to me than anything else that's been discussed inthis channel
because we asked him to
why was jarrett rating shoulders
of?
im slightly horrified
that should tell you
we have everyone's rankings for the BDSM test
i just see jarrett rating shoulders
I can be a switch, sure
wait
It's pinned to the channel
alright who's a top, bottom and switch Noah?
he's correct
You're technically correct
planning
Yike what the hell is happening
or, idk what you'd call two girls on a guy
unless you're talking dp
you mean a switch
wait we already have that information
are there middles in orgies
<@!520095106888630348> I'm down, we just gotta set some ground rules for who is a top and who is a bottom
<@520095106888630348> you're technically not wrong
<@193229269076279298> that seems p cool actually!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyB8jtQVNEo
something like this
https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38100836?adults=8&check_in=2019-10-12&check_out=2019-10-13&source_impression_id=p3_1566975345_kog4p%2FNYN1BSaSvN
O R G Y
or
ORGY
it should either be
why the space?
Emily, get off of Jane's phone
OR GY
I mean we could make it nsfw there ;)
This is also a weird conversation for nsfw lol
<@!193229269076279298> keep me posted on this as this develops lmao
yea which is why i thought that
that's actually pretty damn fair for a weekend trip to another country all things considered
oh lmao i thought you mean 200-300 per person
total
wait, so $200-300 total and $25-40 per person?
for eight people that's $25 - $37.50
cost, eh $200 - $300 is my guess
it'd basically have some reservations depending on the details and coordination of it, but it's most likely stuff that can be worked around if needed and really just inherent to any trip in general
^
how expensive it is, crossing the border, who's going, etc
such as?
i have a few reservations about that but it's more nitty gritty stuff
Seeing Cindy sounds great honestly. I might be down depending on a few things.
I'd have to revive my Airbnb account though
<@340319804747415553> have discussed going up to see <@503787499605458954> and seeing if we could bring up a car or two of others
cronchy hair
Brb I need to shower I have salt in my hair
don't get me wrong, i'd love to see you back, but after going to pullman last week, i would not wish what happened to my legs on you
It's less than 2.5 hours
You can just relax, and do whatever
The only annoying thing going to van is crossing the border
wait actually?
The drive in a bus isn't that bad
Damn you're right
like, you're further than Cindy and Cole combined
But it's a lot of work for such a short time back
dear god
the drive's a bitch though
I'd get back on Friday at 7:00 PM and leave on Sunday at 3:00 PM
I mean I could come back
Yea
because i read that as won't be back ever, which is more concerning
in October you mean?
I'm sorry
Awww Noah :(
what?
I won't be back, sadly/luckily (depends on who you are)
and we're all clumped together in one place where it'll be easy to meet up with a large number of people you wanna see
do it, it'd be fun to see you!
Yeah
except for classes but that's an everyday thing
Come to see us at UW!! We'll like all be in one place.
i don't think there'd be any conflicts in early october?
that's fine right?
DO IT
Oh
When is Canadian Danksgiving?
for CANADIA of all things
But it's in early October
Lena's leaving and most of my Canadian friends are probably going home too
yea
come back and visit the friends you left behind and ABANDONED cindy
Btw I'm thinking of maybe coming back and visiting you guys for Canadian thanksgiving
Than's actually a bit of time then
huh thas weird
Oh wow
Sept 3
When do they start?
Definitely gonna chill once classes start yeah
college kids who haven't started class yet
There's parties happening every night for the next like 2 weeks
Although who parties on a Monday night?
ella is a mood
Big mood
Actually Ella (English girl) tried to convince us to party again tonight but everyone else was like no
was it all the stripping
I'm actually back in my room p early today bc we were all exhausted
Idk, I'll ask tomorrow!
oh wow
Small world
And I met the good friend of one of my best friends from jsa
wait lmao does she still remember me?
Ok my Thai friend met some kids from Dubai who knew her best friend
yea 'tell her i say 'hi
we went to elementary school together and swam together in middle school but she was at beaver lake
Yo that's crazy
oh lmao
She's literally in my group LMAO
My roommate's an Issy kiddo
WAIT
Alex Tangas
What's her name? I met an Issaquah kid
how big is the campus/likely is it that you know her?
oh one of my swim friends from IHS goes to UBC now
I finally found someone who enjoys platonic cuddling as much as I do though she's great
No lmao
<@503787499605458954> did you know them before you met them at UBC?
But yeah
After I graduate still
oh wait actually, Cindy? That's hype
Honestly, if early retirement is on the table, that's a super valid reason for moving
It's more for the experience
My parents are considering moving back to Canada so they can retire early lol
Na, Boeing moves them, they keep the house
Nice!!
One of my best friends here is from London!!
i feel like a lot of parents move after all their kids leave for college
they don't need the big house in the suburbs anymore
They *may* move after he leaves depending on what offers he gets, seeing as he gets them fairly often
They considered it though
Wholesome
My parents turned it down because of Gabe
You know my dad got a call to move to London about 3 months ago
Master of stealth over here
I removed that because I didnt think the joke worked
Hmm
Jarrett lmao
fair enough i guess
A hole's a hole
Smh
I stopped try to remember them all a long time ago (when I was living in Europe)
I've been to Haiti Jamaica and the dominican republic
I sometimes forget Florida from my country count
?
Lowkey I always forget to add those places to my country count though and it makes me feel really bad
(don't)
<@503787499605458954> now these are the literary references worth sharing with Matheny
Sand, water, and heat
Me too
I like the Caribbean
Lol
It's coarse and rough and gets everywhere
I hate the cold
It's course, rough, irritating, and if gets everywhere
I love water
Hey one of the girls Im highkey attracted to went with me
I like sand
I don't like sand
90% at least middle aged
pull a Reluctant Fundamentalist and bring your crush there
Sand was sooo nice
All old people or do Students go nude as well?
It's actually like the most famous beach in van city
Fun times
unfortunate
Catch: clothes optional
There's a super nice beach 10 mins from campus
Never really was a fan of them in Europe
can i ask why?
Wait what?
An orgy already?
Why would you leave it on your nightstand when you have a penis-shaped cupholder built into your butt?
Nude beaches
Ah
Y'all I saw so many dicks today it was v uncomfortable
Leave it on the nightstand
Smart move
^
I usually unscrew mine before going to sleep
That would could work
Also micropenis
<@258094439636008971> it is?
exactly
They're kinda attached to people
How do you lose a penis?
but like
assuming this is a heterosexual relationship, if they never wake up the penis just like got lost in there somewhere, there's no other explanation
I think he mentioned something about an ice bath and we just took that and ran with it
oh ok
<@520095106888630348> it's an old joke from a couple months back I guess
<@173668455856340994> warm breathing felshlight doesn't appeal to you?
noah's into necrophilia?????
what
<@520095106888630348> I mean, we already know <@193229269076279298> is into that
That's what masturbation is for
or they're dead
Sex cant be a singleplayer event
you're doing something wrong if they never wake up
See
At a certain point its the whole dead fish gig
Or is it still hot if they're asleep the whole time?
Is it important that they wake up eventually to you?
And they wake up eventually
Granted it's consensual
Getting it on while they're sleeping is hot
I will now clarify
Unsent it
Realized it sounded kinda rapey
Sent it
Leaving this for reference unless Jarrett brings back his message
`first one sounds hot` -Jarrett Chang-Lamb
<@173668455856340994> where did your message go -_-
somnophilia yea
I'm gonna pretend like I didn't see that, Jarrett
Some people like to fuck people while they sleep (yes that's a fetish), others prefer to fuck people when they are awake
Idk, depends on their fetishes
does that count?
i'm really good at waking up in the afternoon
I'm not sure what to tell you
being good a something (for most things) is attractive, especially if it's physical
Guys are so fucking attractive when they can dance what the fuck
Ok I'll stop now
Same idea as in sex
So you drill then ream
It can only take a couple thousand of an inch off a hole
It's like a very very precise drill
No
Is it not?
Are you saying a reamer is attached to the drill press?
*attach to the drill press*
But technically yes
Including your dick
Well you can put a lot of things in a drill press
Those things you can put on the drill press?
(Do you know what a reamer is?)
Gonna ream dat ass
Drill me Noah
Oh yes
Jarrett
Me
Give me a second
It just feels like an innuendo
My favorite is the hand holder the large drill bit
The mix
I found this funny
Moving over here for this part
I will enlighten you all later
I have found a far superior system to spotify
Solid top 10
mm is pretty good
if you like this pls listen to the juice vol. 1 it's so fucking good
I'm going to see them in a few weeks at vancouver's westbrook music festival I'M SO EXCITED

how can you say this but not share it
idk if this should go here or in music but I just wanted to announce that my favorite new release is a song about mutual masturbation
4k is the right answer
Yeah
https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ctaoff/my_gender_studies_teacher_asked_how_i_view/
Got plenty of time to think on it
But I mean like I said this is happening probably 10 years from now at earliest
I do have design ideas that would be kinda unique to me in that they'd have specific meaning to me personally (not just the angel/devil thing but that would be the base)
Oh god
........
now an octopus anus tattoo
no <@!173668455856340994> a cross is also a bad idea
*like a cross*
unless you feel like you can do something unique to you
it's been overdone a bit much at this point
don't do wings
<@!503787499605458954> was thinking about it more
Look that hair and those glasses go in the hall of shame
You don't have the worst yearbook photo
We don‚Äôt talk about my short hair
Sigh
We're looking at old yearbooks
The truth was in front of us the whole time
He‚Äôs the hidden twin what are u talking about
Rip
Always thought it was hilarious that Gene split the twins apart
Jane why did you post that
Tea
üëÄ
What? All the gay porn I've been watching?
Oh?
<@173668455856340994> I think I know what started this question
Is all I'm sayin
Well there's a reason for the insane number of gay ships in every tumblr fandom
I've just seen waaaaaaaaaay too much bts gay fan fiction
And it really wouldn't
To Gene, yes there was some good insight there
Don't ask me
Why would emi being a kpop fan skew her opinion anyways
<@173668455856340994> happy now?
I wasn't asleep just not paying attention
Like. Assume you're straight, you're now attracted to both people instead of one
You're welcome?
Ok it's not personally my thing but I know for a fact some girls find gay porn hot the same way a lot of guys find lesbian porn hot
It wouldn't be worthless
Eh, I mean
That would give bad data
Like I couldnt ask a gay guy about this
Unlike anyone else
You‚Äôre smart
She can actually provide a comparison for you unlike most people
.... ok
Man
So it doesnt matter
But she's a girl not a guy
My thoight proccess was that Cindy would be a bad person to ask cause she's bi
You just realized that Jarrett?
From what I know, some lesbians don't even like lesbian porn because it's supposedly really unrealistic
Wait my mind is warped
True that
ü§∑
From what I know ppl like lesbian porn more bc it‚Äôs not as much of an aggressive sausage fest
She's just probably asleep right now
You‚Äôre on your own
Cuz she'd probably actually attempt to answer
Cindy would probably be the most help actually
This is a bad place to poll
Emily is a kpop fan
Cindy wont be much help
You're strangely intent on finding data for this
Hmmmm
Idc
Idk dude
But the idea
I know
So can‚Äôt help ya
I don‚Äôt watch porn
I hope you're not connected to wifi
You're also in an nsfw channel on Discord right now
I'll take things im not googling at my internship for $500 Alex
Or you can use Google to avoid subjecting your friends to this
You can literally be a primary source rn
ü§∑
Do some girls think gay porn is hot the way some guys think lesbian porn is hot
Lmaooo mad respect
Lmaoooo
I aspire to this level of badass pettiness
I would get a tattoo if it meant something to me and I'd probably want a small one that was easy to hide if it ever became inconvenient
my suggestion
small dicks with wings
Nah baby steps 18 will be a mini one
I thought you meant when you turned 18
oh yea then go for it
If that back tattoo happens it's gonna be at least 10 years down the line lol
Oh
I would hold off on large tattoos until you're old for two main reasons 
1) they're very expensive and time consuming to do right
2) we're still in a very developmental stage of our lives and tattoos are rather permanent (yes they can be removed, but it's expensive, time consuming, and imperfect)
Why
<@!503787499605458954> I would heavily suggest against large tattoos
L
hahaha
There is an older couple making out next to me and Helen rn and it's very uncomfortable
I've also thought about getting a tiny one behind an ear
kind of want one under a shoulder blade and maybe one on my leg
i think i'll stick with small ones for myself
Probably a no if I wanna go into government or business
I also really like some of the sleeves I've seen but
and some get cut off kinda awkwardly
That's fine with me
big tattoos are cool but if you kinda think about it regular clothes end up showing only parts of it
I'm into the idea of getting wings but like one angel wing one devil
I also kinda want a big one on my back
But as of rn I'm thinking of getting a line of text under my collarbone for my first
I need to do more research on like typical workplace regulations
but i haven't found any designs that i particularly *love* yet
i really dig how watercolor style tattoos look
i kind of want a few subtle ones
oh tattoo chatter
Thinking of getting one for my 18th tbh
I want a few
1) I have to like the entire design, no "I like most of it but part of it feels off"
2) I have to have liked the design for several years
3) The design has to have the potential to not look dated for decades (this one is really hard to judge)
4) The design has to need to be on a body (i.e if it looks as good as wall art as on someone's body why are you getting it on a body, it has to gain something from being on me, or I'd just get it as wall art)
5) fading needs to be considered and accounted for
it would have to meet a lot of criteria
for me idk
I can imagine that
And really start to hate it
But i would find something wrong with it
Not because of tattoos themselves
I wanna say no
Quick poll out of curiosity who here would/wants to get a tattoo
There is a 99% chance that I would have a problem with that
But you know
Nothing inherently wrong with that
Like a face tattoo
Ok then that would also make me reconsider but idk if definite pass
I mean no but the personality implication matters a lot
yes
Are dick piercings a Thing
do you have an inherent problem with have sex with a person that has genital area tattoos
but I'm saying ignoring all the personality stuff
ok I get that
Also kinda screams bad life decision at me
Just personally I think anybody who's like modifying their crotch area too much is rather excessively fixated showing it off
well ignoring that
That's most of it
Well
ignoring the personality that likely accompanies an octopus anal tattoo
For me I think any excessive tattoos near the crotch area is a no
why?
really
Thats a hard no
Oh remember that octopus anus tattoo
dick piercings?
On the topic of weird piercings I think a clit piercing would freak me out but not necessarily be a hard no
Idk what actual dealbreakers would be for me tbh aside from the regular stuff i.e. bad hygiene
It's kinda wack
I have seen multiple penis hentai
I didn't even think of that
Oh dear god
Some people are into tentacle porn but that's not something that can be actually practiced
It wouldn't be useless to them
Idk, maybe some people out there are really into someone having multiple penises
I think how you measure something is less important than if it's useful
But like how do you measure it?
It would be useless, sure
(also, I hate that that wasn't even the most cursed thing I've said in the past 12 hours)
Also jerking off would be difficult
That would be pretty useless though
When added up, totaled up to be the length of an average penis
And they like
What if someone had several micropenises
This is a really fucked up hypothetical but
Micropenis is not necessarily a deal breaker depending on what else you're willing to do but I would appreciate if you let me know beforehand
I don't think it's that weird
You say no but you have a separate safeword for Actual No
Sometimes people fantasize about being rape victims, doesn't mean they actually want to get raped. Consent play is a thing
I still feel like you'd be treading on very thin ice
its consentual
i mean
Like, usually, I don't judge people for weird shit they do in bed, but if I were to draw a line, this is probably the place to do it
Ok, but this is kinda yikes
people do weird shit as part of sex all the time
why would it be?
not really
Isn't it concerning though?
na, let people enjoy themselves
That's pretty fucking wack
Wooaaahh what the hell
basically rape play
consent non consent
... what does it stand for??
Excuse me, but what the fuck??
and I always forget the other meaning it has
I normally browse r/machinists, but sometime when I'm looking for specifically CNC stuff I'll go on r/cnc
I'm 99% confident I take proper care of my hygiene, and if someone else doesn't smell like a dying rat, I guess I can assume the same for them. It's gotten me through life so far lmao.
I'm really confused, but whatever
Well alright
That's just a deal breaker
No no
What does a cross tattoos have anything to do with hygiene?
I am really confused now
*cut marks*
*cross tattoo*
Again, I understand what bad hygiene is. I just don't understand how you wouldn't be able to tell someone has bad hygiene until the clothes start coming off. I feel like I'm missing an exception or something, but I've just been saying that the examples you guys have mentioned so far are just things you'd normally notice about someone before your hypothetical came into play.
Yes? She said four words. Kinda hard not to read it.
did you read what Bethany said
Again, if someone had problematic BO, I feel like you'd be able to tell long before you're stuck in a bedroom with them
Dry shampoo and deodorant.
Ok, but if someone hasn't showered in 2 weeks, I'm pretty sure you'd be able to tell waaaay before clothes are off
just imagine not showing in like 2 weeks
do you not know what bad hygiene is?
Beyond STDs of course
What constitutes bad genital hygiene
looks like?
May I ask what this looks like so I don't have to look up images myself?
bad genital hygiene
Out of curiosity, what qualifies as "bad hygiene" that you can't already tell from before y'all are in a room together?
AIDS is indeed an STD
stds (is HIV an std?), bad hygiene, saying you don't need to use a condom, bigger dick than me
railroad tracks
let me think for a second
Aren't cross tattoos fairly common?
I'm not sure if that's ironic or unironic
*cross tattoos*
<@193229269076279298> you gonna answer your own question?
Oh. In that case general uncleanliness, stds, and expectations not discussed beforehand.
I thought that was your answer to my original question which I summoned everyone for
oh
That dicks can be feminine. I‚Äôd say no.
disagree?
To answer the original question, it's all off the moment I realize the other person is actually just Jarrett
Only that some would disagree.
<@!561219716429905920> gonna explain the "But"
<@!472541429130854421> you never elaborated
I tried hitting on Noah and left for 15 minutes. I'm not sure what else I expected.
Nope
wait you've never read that before?
The numbers don't lie
That... actually makes sense haha
"Actually, futa can be made less gay than straight porn. You see, straight porn has one guy and one girl. Because you're fapping to something with one guy in it, that's 50% gay. If you watch futa fuck a girl, that's one girl and a half girl, thus only 25% gay. You could make it 0% gay with two girls but the problem is, that makes them lesbian, which wraps back to being 100% gay."
Never thought it was something I could get into, definitely some weird guilty faps to be had there
like 10%
futa is the least gay type of sex
But some of them are pretty good
Well not all of them
Tbh the futa doujins are pretty good
it's a joke <@!233062637922025472> and <@!173668455856340994> should get
I‚Äôd say no. But
sorry you're out of the loop
Can a dick be feminine at all
also what if it's a futa?
???
also what if it's a feminine dick?
wait does that not just make it better?
If she has a dick
elaborate
Weird piercings
@everyone
Cross tattoo
you're in someone's room and clothes are coming off, what are your deal breakers?
I know <@!503787499605458954> said she would possibly not hook up with someone if they had one, but I kinda would like to hear from everyone on this
where I mentioned it's a problem that the other person only knows about after you're already rather far along
actually this reminded me of a different discussion we had on micropenisies
<@193229269076279298> I'll shave your pubes for you if you'll shave mine üòâ
... are you hitting on me?
I'm just saying for personal reasons
oh no
Noah, are you trying to tell me to become a porn star?
What the hell is that supposed to imply
store it away just in case you ever need it ;)
This is kinda wack
I'm not sure what to do with this information
Eh, I mean, sure?
basically less of it is "hidden" away
That's not an image I needed in my head
Yike
I want to say no, but we both know you're gonna do it anyways
9 inch dick
4 foot dude
You're just asking me for permission to draw a dick
I mean
That's a lot of attention paid towards how big something looks
want me to do a drawing to explain it?
also most porn stars are shorter than you think, for the same reason, makes it look bigger in comparison
Why would it look bigger?
it's one of the reasons most porn stars have shaved pubes
some people shave their pubes just to make their dick look bigger
Sure but I'm scared
wanna hear something semi on topic and uncomfortable
Potential tmi: I learned earlier today that some guys shave hair from their balls (not like trim, but like go at it with a razor), and that does not sound like it should be physically possible
Well, this has been fun
And I'm the one who despises physics
crystal clear
It made sense to me
yes
I just want to check my explanation makes sense
Rip
idk
Are they even still here?
<@!503787499605458954>, <@!173668455856340994>, <@!472541429130854421> you guys get it as well?
Pubic hair helps with friction?
I should've asked the real questions during IB Bio
for armpit, pubic, and inner thigh hair it helps with friction
Evolution remains a mystery
of that idk
happy to explain the common misconception about tires
Although what friction is chest hair and pubic hair gonna be reducing?
I get it now
np
Thank you, Noah
and the blue are wet tires
Alright, that makes sense
the green are intermediate tires
and if it doesn't have someone it gets between the tire and the road and then you have no traction
the water needs somewhere to go
Thanks
That makes sense now
Ohhh ok
but more importantly, water
because the surface isn't as smooth on normal roads
good question
and when you're going 200 mph aerodynamic drag is much more important than frictional drag
The why do normal car tires lose friction as their treads wear down?
so they can take the corners faster without flying off the track
because while it does increase frictional drag, it also gives them more lateral grip in corners
So then why would formula one want more friction?
therefore the friction has as well
see how the contact area has been reduced
#2 (with hair)
#1 (without hair)
But I guess that's aside the point
I'm still a little confused as to why having more contact area is ideal for formula one though
Ohhh ok, I think I kinda get it
now image skin on a macro level
Yeah
see how #2 has less contact area
But wouldn't having less points of contact reduce friction?
#2
#1
I guess that makes sense?
if the surface you're mating with is smooth (the track) then the optimal surface of the tires is also smooth
they have come to the conclusion that the most important part of grip is the contact area
they know what they're doing
formula one spends a lot of money to be the fastest racing series in the world
So the goal is to reduce traction?
Almost as smooth as shaved armpits
notice how smooth it is
this is a racetrack surface
Ngl
My first impulse is to touch it
mhm
Very
do you notice how smooth it is
so this is a formula 1 tire
He edited it
ok
wasn't paying attention
11:22
oops
today?
when was this
He wants us to have this resolved
``Ok I'm almost back from the gym so you guys better have this resolved or I'm gonna go on a car rant about how grip works ``
k
no let him spea
Is the move to change the subject?
Uh oh
Watch out
I'm almost back to my desktop
Yeah, sorry, Noah
I have a feeling noah was gonna say what I was gonna say before this got derailed
Love me a quality serenade

Q
Ok I'm almost back from the gym so you guys better have this resolved or I'm gonna go on a car rant about how grip works
Yeah tbh I think it would be worse
Idk how pubic hair would stop chafing between thighs though
My thigh bones and muscle are far apart so the part that touches is just insubstantial fat that doesn't offer significant resistance
teach me your ways
how
I don't have a thigh gap as of now and I don't get any chafing
it's kinda considered an unhealthy beauty standard for girls
Well when you sit your thighs kinda *squorsh*
Oh that makes a bit more sense
like with your feet together
When you stand?
^
When your thighs dont touch when you stand
It sounds vaguely familiar
I'm amazed that you've never heard of this (not a bad thing)
What's a thigh gap?
Also thrusting
Also thrusting
I have a thigh gap and I still chafe sometimes
Wdym?
Or chafing
Have you heard of not having a thigh gap
Ummmmm
There's no contact there
Well gene
What about pubic hair?
But it doesn't rub
It‚Äôs a pivot
The skin stretches
hinges
they're just like
But they don't rub against each other
When you bend your elbows
And have contact
At your elbows, your forearm and biceps connect
Yes you are correct, you put hair at points of skin on skin contact because it reduces friction
I'm confused
Because it's putting hair at a point of skin-on-skin contact?
?
But logistically, the point stands
But adding hair makes it like smooth on rough
Skin on skin would be smooth on smooth
Smooth on rough is bad for grip though
Smooth on smooth works well, as does rough on rough
Look at slicks for track use vs really car tires
It's like racing car tires
Well technically, smooth surface contact
Because it's only really effective for skin on skin contact
that would be terrifying
As cursed as those concepts sound
Or knee hair
Elbow hair
So then why don't we have like
and it might be very specific but it falls under a general rule
anything that broke skin could lead to infection and death so. he's right
That's really specific
Well originally if you got a skin burn it could lead to an infection and then death
very slowly though since presumably most of the hair disappeared while we were swimming in water
yeah that's probably happening
maybe humans are in the middle of adapting to less body hair
hair matters less and less from a survival perspective these days though
there isn't one most advantageous height from a survival perspective
Why purpose does chest hair serve?
That's not what I'm getting at
uh no
Same reason
most girls don't have enough of it to be effective
Why does height vary
"from experience"
but then why do some girls have not enough of it to be effective
?
sex
Why the fuck do people have chest hair then?
from experience I kinda disagree but I guess that's the theory
<@503787499605458954> is correct
ok that makes sense
yes
^
does graphite actually work?
he means like if you let the hair grow naturally it helps reduce skin chafing
Dry lube is something like graphite
what if it just means something lame like non-alcoholic lube
Yes because you never bothered to elaborate and Cindy provided counterpoints
yeah what even is dry lube
also i think i hate kissing in general so maybe my opinion is invalid
Ok did everyone just ignore my dry lube comment?
People are attracted to things *because* they supposedly have evolutionary benefit
sometimes it looks good but like gene says, admire from a distance lmao
personally i'd hate to kiss someone with a lot of beard. some beard is even worse
why do you have a bush on your face
ok sometimes beards make guys 10x more attractive and other times I'm just like
And Helen, from what I understand about evolution, it works the other way around
~~some people are into it~~
eeaaurughghhg
b e a r d  b u r n
maybe women find it attractive and that's the only reason it continues?
Facial hair works like a cactus: it seems cool from afar but no one wants to touch you because it's scratchy as fuck
but I don't really get it from an evolutionary standpoint either
there's a correlation between beard thickness and baldness
yes but you have to sacrifice head hair
beards help keep you warm too
it's definitely not necessary
the only exception is men's facial hair which i don't understand at all
Such as?
i think they server purposes other than simply heat
But like, what to weird, sparse patches of hair around your body do?
I kinda miss it but eh
My neck used to be warm as fuck
long head hair does actually help keep you warm, from experience
Body hair is super wack
having short head hair doesn't really do anything
body hair is wack
idk
warmth??
Ok, but like why the hell do we need hair exactly?
I get it trimmed p regularly, if I want it to be longer I just trim slightly less
i would continue to let it grow again but since its bleached i think i'll need to cut more often
for like an extended period of time
your hair growth rate is pretty normal then
tbh I also can't remember just letting my hair Grow
That's how I ended up with long hair
I let it grow once for 9 months straight
meanwhile i barely cut my hair for 3 years and it went from long to longer
you have to cut more frequently to keep it looking presentable
your perception is skewed from ours
My head hair grows pretty fast too
yeah I can do that in like a few months
my head hair grows less than 6 inches a year
Puberty: Bitch you thought
I guess the benefit to that is that my head hair also grows super fast
i assumed puberty was like over when i was 15 but then i got armpit hair afterwards
esp an asian girl
I'm p hairy for a girl
huh
yeah I don't remember exactly but definitely middle school
Honestly, similar story for me
damn
i think i was like 15 and was surprised bc it was so late i thought it just wouldn't happen
at what age did you get armpit hair?
knowing myself I probably freaked out and started shaving it basically immediately after growing it
i pluck it sometimes and it takes a couple weeks to grow out
I feel like I've shaved it as long as I can remember
I honestly cannot recall
Not even when you first got armpit hair?
Oh
oh huh
I mean like letting it grow out to whatever length it would end up as
To be honest, after looking at some other people's armpits, I don't think I'll EVER experience full armpit hair
but not having armpit hair feels fine
Wdym full?
I don't think I've ever experienced Full armpit hair
Idk
May be because we sweat there and it could get infected if it stays that way
But I‚Äôm also too lazy to get rid of it consistently
So it's bad until it reaches a long enough length that it buckles instead of poking you
Then why the fuck do we have hair there to begin with?
The growing back part is bad
Skin on skin has high friction due to the higher contact area, once it starts to grow back the short sharp hair starts to poke you
<@472541429130854421> sounds like a bad idea lmao
Soft baby skin
As kids?
We all used to not have armpit hair
Ok, but like
I would rather not tbh
Also random but some of us compared rice purity test results earlier in the year
I think we should do it again before college and see what college brings
It did get better with excessive lotion
Hm interesting
It felt bad for like weeks dude
That shit is sensitive
No no
It's freshly shaved skin
Oh look, almost seems like it would benefit from some lubrication
Of course it's gonna feel bad
Dude, you fucking shaved it
Skin rubbing against skin constantly does not feel nice
Its fine and then it grows back more prickly
And it feels pretty darn bad
Yeah pro swimmers do it to reduce drag or some crap
Yeah
That's not unheard of
And I know girls do it
Ye
Like, shaved it?
Cause it was bothering me mildly
Before showering I removed all the hair from my armpits
Yeah?
Like a year back
Aight so
Damn
I know it might be a foreign concept to you
Helen has friends
Why is a guy from John Hopkins messaging you?
Rip
John hopkins
Yes this is normal
JHU?
Is this a normal occurrence?
Oh boi
Drunk JHU guy strikes again
what
....
my roommate shared with me a book he has
No thanks. It's already pretty self-explanatory.
do it
There's a joke to be made here that makes me very uncomfortable
idk someone probably has a kink for the first one
From Reddit

"I think it's funny that "forgive me father, for I have sinned" and "sorry Daddy, I've been naughty" don't mean the same thing at all"
Oh ok one sec
noah's gone now lol
gene lmk if you're still available
That was fast
Lmaooo ok then
noah called me
Can you give me 2-3 minutes?
i need to figure out why i can't discord call while playing ow
can someone do me a favor and call me rn
We went straight from nsfw to sad boi hours
But straight up, it's so weird starting so late
I might do a summer quarter class idk yet
Lmao
Oh that's fair
if people wanna take it
yeah, it's to make room for a summer semester
That's like a whole semester
You get four months of summer tho
Ooferoni
in feb
but I only have one legit midterm break
I'm so jealous
I'm done mid-april
my school year ends way before yours
I know, it's crazy
Straight up, college is coming so fast
i think you get breaks earlier than we do
you guys have a lot more breaks than I do though
just cuz UW's schedule is wack af
i feel like that's gonna happen a lot lmao
during finals
that isn't like
if I ever have a break when yall don't
mmm
you should still bool with us sometime tho
idk which ones off the top of my head
some of them stay open
booooooooooooooooooooooo
UW dorms are closed for break
but yeah halloween is like the main thing I get genuinely hyped for some time in advance
alternatively, if some of you UW folks go back early, I might join y'all for a day or two
my sister is also leaving after christmas and my parents don't let me do anything fun (read: stay out till midnight)
there's a good chance I'm gonna try to go back to vancouver before nye this year
for now, it's just more asian parties
ok, i could maybe see that
I'm excited for possible new years parties in my future, that could be lit
truth
everything else I mostly just got excited for bc we had school off
chinese new year just makes me feel guilty for being so disconnected with chinese culture
I only like chinese new year bc I get paid and that's the tea on that
what other holidays do I actually like
i'm not even being biased
the food at asian parties are only good when my parents host and that's the fucking tea
occasionally i have to babysit a random-ass seven year old as per usual asian parties, but that's few and far in between
my parents' family friends are mostly their age, and their kids are all like scott's age, so most asian parties are me sitting in a corner by myself
thanksgiving used to be the only asian parties where i'd actually see my friends
asian parties are a BIG reason I've never liked thanksgiving
yeah, ok, that makes sense
I feel like this is a factor
it's all good dw I'm just saying
aww im sorry, cindy
which like. clearly I have problems w mine
i feel kinda evil saying i dont like christmas
idk the traditional holiday season tends to be all about family
i like everything about winter that isnt christmas
but I don't like them because of christmas
ok true
I like wintery things that are often associated with christmas
<@!520095106888630348> we're dead to you, arent we?
I'm not a huge fan of christmas
including christmas
i can find a reason to dislike pretty much any holiday you throw at me
idk if i have one
halloween is probably my favorite holiday
halloween has a very particular smell
aw
im personally not a fan of halloween
it's a lot of effort
UW people, pls remedy
this is sad
i havent dressed up for halloween in years
yea I don't think I'm pretty enough for that
<@!340319804747415553> douse him in glitter
Imma need you to be edward cullen for halloween
yes
i think that's the clarification
and drink it????????/
it's not scary, just kinda nast
just add water
dried blood is kinda gross
correction
you're a vampire
we know, noah
i'm not scared of it, but it's a little gross if there's just a random blood stain lying around
but I've been over that
blood tastes good
ok I don't find blood that gross if we're talking about bodily fluids
we are indeed
then again, humans are gross
it's p nast outside of your mouth
oh I meant that as an add-on to the gross fountains thing
ok, if i can't see them, they're probably gross if i were to encounter them
saliva is kinda gross in some contexts
goodnight
there are a lot more bodily fluids you don't see
night helen
g'night helen
add saliva into the mix
the only bodily fluid that isn't overtly gross are tears
*bye
i'm going to sleep now by guys
he's not wrong
ew gene
sex is weird
whoever came up with it should be shot
there are so many fucking fluids involved. humans' pelvic regions are basically gross fountains
lol
sex is p gross
and weird
then it doesn't matter to much either way
sex IS gross
cuz if it's just in and out once
sex is gross
at what point have you "taken the dick"?
ok but
true
the latter would probably make me feel a lot grosser
I'd also just be more willing to deal with 15 different people fucking me with strap-ons versus 15 different Actual Dicks
as interesting as a belt consisting of 15 strap-ons would be
i dont think that counts if it's one person wearing 15 different strap-ons
no waiting for manly refractory periods
ok well
pay for a lot of sex?
your best option by far is to just do 15 strap-ons
as far as strategies go
F
sorry i meant to share the actual picture
helen, you have a slightly disturbing amount of content  to share on this
that's a risky fucking click
https://images.app.goo.gl/Z5R2XprQTodBpB136
also I love currently listening to a song about gay sex lmao
15 dick challenge strategies anyone?
wait explain the second comment
we're still off topic
we're getting off topic
the clitoris exists so females want sex/enjoy sex as well, therefore humans keep procreating
the prostate exists so God can laugh at gay people
i will endearingly call a lot of birds "loveable birbs"
not chickens
chickens are monsters
less chickens
thank goodness
given the opportunity they can and will eat each other
did you know chickens are naturally cannibalistic
i was not aware that non-mammals had penises until IB Bio brought it to my attention
mostly cuz i didn't bother to contemplate this cursed information
sadly, also knew that one
in case you were wondering
otters rape baby seals to death
https://nypost.com/2017/05/06/dont-be-fooled-ducks-are-sadistic-raping-monsters/amp/
i asked out loud "wait, birds have penises?" in 6th period ib bio
I knew about this ~~thanks reddit~~ but never actually image searched it
duck Tigger
some insects (grasshoppers?) have some weird shit
a lot of species have wack-ass dicks
that's terrifying lmao
you're welcome
wait what the fuck
i will never forget the day in IB Bio where we just looked at different dicks
*spring-loaded as well
i still have no idea what it looks like
fucking duck dick
corkscrew barbed dicks
no no no
shit
oh wait
i dont
screw dick?
I hate that I know what you're referring to
but neither is it the worst way
lmao
ok, i thought we were having an evolutionary discussion.
if we wanna talk about pleasure function then yeah, they have function
the duck way is not the best way
i have not had sex straight or not so my experience is sad lol
you want both sides to want it
<@!503787499605458954> gets it
the prostate has some function other than sexual stimulation
ok if you think the clit is unimportant to straight sex you will have sad straight sex
a lot of people dont know
it's almost like they were made for gay people
yeah evolutionarily why the fuck does prostate stimulation exist
also it makes mistakes
i don't know why the prostate and clitoris exist
but your DNA doesn't always express itself the same every time and in everyone
i dont know if anal sex is really a part of evolution
but it's in our genetic code
I agree, there is variation
some girls don't like it either
nature doesn't do thing intentionally
not all guys like penetration
<@!193229269076279298>
üòâ hey cutie
yeah but half the people here are girls
by "us" I mean all humans
was that intentional by nature
^
I'm actually including all you too
is a thing
<@!193229269076279298> is that an invitation?
prostate
hey i mean
are you including yourself in this
üëÄ
"us"
the act of penetration feeling good is hardwired into us
as someone who is definitely speaking from experience as a 100% certified lesbian:
dick is far from your only option
yeah
ok fair
you just may not like what it's attached to
I'm pretty sure you can be lesbian and still like dick
but they wouldn't have had the option of dick if they wanted to
it's kinda the point that they aren't attracted to it
they don't necessarily miss dick
hahahaha
<@!193229269076279298> you're no longer one of us
lol
LMAO
lmao
why?
why?
why?
i feel bad for lesbians before strap ons were invented
yeah, strap-ons count
lol
give me the  s t r a p
also you're discriminating against lesbians
that's where i draw the line. this thing has no value.
that's too specific lol
why isn't the 15 dick challenge on the rice purity test
but you could do it in less than 2 hours
an underestimate
i'm unlikely to own a car for a long time
ok that's
like 60 mins for me
again, 100 miles is really not far
cue "my parents aren't home" memes
i'd break up with someone if we had to do long distance for a long time
that's kinda unlikely too though
actually the scenario for that that's most likely is if my SO for some reason lived 100 miles away and i wanted to see them
yeah
damn ok, the 100 miles one isn't that crazy actually
we drove like 300 miles this past weekend one way
it over 100 miles
nah that's like 300
you're right
is that 100 miles? damn
oh wait
100 miles is not actually that far
might get that one checked off fast
"sprinkle a little bit of crack on him"
you're in wsu now so you'd have to travel over 100 miles to see your brothers
"oh no, i accidentally spilled crack into my scrambled eggs instead of salt"
you speaking from experience?
you do what you gotta do
also when your hooked on drugs and your dealer is 100 miles away
accidents happen
not that desperate
i'm also very unlikely to travel 100+ miles only for sex
yeah most of the drugs are pretty unlikely for me
my biggest fear in life
horse tranqs are probably some strong shit
PREGNANCY OH GOD
meth/crack/heroin/horse tranquilizers (???? why is that on there)
tobacco
same
ok, so illegal shit aside
by the police
ok but like
handcuffs can be kinky for some people
handcuffs
arrest
felony
there's a bunch I never want to check off tbh
didn't realize that was on here
felony
wait no
mile high club maybe?
also I just took it again I'm at 50
what are you least likely to check off
ok aside from incest and bestiality
oh GOD
well if i have sex with them that would also check off "travelled more than 100 miles for sex"
until the day I was scarred for life
and my cousins are in china lmao
that's what I thought about mine
they're the least sexual parents i've ever met
hahahaha gene
but like i would never want to do it with my parents
doesn't have to be a sibling
might happen for noah
i can commit bestiality if i wanted to
cousins
parents
not impossible
like it's impossible for me
no actually i'm least likely to incest
which is less likely?
bestiality or incest?
is it bestiality if the animal just decides to run up and fuck you?
hmmm
you can get arrested by circumstance
yeah bestiality is like very very unlikely lmao
and yes
yes
can you pay a hooker for a romantic date?
*bestiality*
what is the rice purity test item you are least likely to commit?
what if you hire yourself as a hooker
does that count as still a "date" or "romantic"
im trying to think of more interesting questions
one thing leads to another
what if you hire a hooker
I go back to my place
what if i go out to a movie with myself
asking the real questions
what if it escalates to auto-fellatio?
not really
can i hold hands with myself romantically?
^
i think the date one counts if you were aware of it
holding hands does not because you could argue it wasnt "romantic"
rofl RIP
oh and also like last december
hm
like a year ago
when?
lol
F
yes
did soemone try to date you and hold your hand
were you aware of this while it was happening?
does it count as holding hands romantically and being on a date if both these notions were one-sided LMAO
you can come to UW!
and also don't want to get rescinded yet
that's a big mood
but too lazy
lmao
i mean i can also vandalize something and get arrested
*thing
that's the one think on the rice purity test i can do right now
it fell over
your n is already drunk
*oblivion
time to drink myself into obliviou
what a time to be alive
kek
i think i have a C or D
helen, do something so i dont have to think about IB anymore
hahaha
oooooooof
.....................for dick
I'm at a D
L
lol
92 will always be associated with IB for me now
it accurately describes my GPA
hahahaha
that's still an A on the IB scale
what's changed
tea
92
that seems fair enough
is what I meant
I don't see you doing frequent casual hookups
idk if i'd classify myself as a romantic, but if partying is the other end of the spectrum, then maybe
yeah, partying isn't really my scene
lol
that's not much of an improvement
which
wait i can only check off one
and also not a partier
oh wait i can check off a few now
yeah but gene's more of a romantic
lmao pure children
gotta one-up helen
ayyyy
96 gang
there's a long way to fall
i'm still like 95
lol probably
I don't have much further to fall
mine has already taken a pre-college hit
which question?
prob helen
on the purity score drop
I vote helen
oh back to that question
just casual sex?
who's rice purity score will drop the fastest once we go to college?
this is a real turn from questioning if i was asexual a couple years ago
oh also define hookup
chaos element
gene is the real dark horse
hookup every night
hahahaha
excuse me what
i dont think you have but im not surprised
Gene gonna surprise all of us
on the other hand, idk if I've mentioned this to y'all, but I'm actually not a super sexual person
i am not against messing around
i don't see myself getting into a relationship for a while so tbh i might be up there too
i would vote for starbot if he were alive
but who knows, maybe shit will happen if there's a breakup
on one hand, I think she's after more Emotional Connection than me
i am a monogamous bitch
I think it's between me and emi
yeah I was gonna say
i vote for <@184405311681986560>
i would not be surprised by emi or cindy
k so prediction time: who's having the most hookups
<@!340319804747415553> you have been overridden
bitches
that's the spirit!
well i'm bringing it back to nsfw
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuckikkk
work those kegels bitch
and also makes me question the guys i know who do yoga
this sounds like a bad reason to do yoga
also, boys, this is a reason to do yoga
both
i think it's easier to refer to it as "sucking your own dick"
or both?
does that count as giving or receiving oral?
isn't it called autofellatio or something
never said it couldn't be your own
yeah
Does that count as taking a dick?
So you know how some guys are like reeeeaaally flexible and can suck their own dick?
like one of those novelty giant pencils
Wait guys
well I'm sure a 12" dick is longer but thinner
babies fitting out of it is extraordinarily painful and I don't plan to experience it ever
Jarrett has to pay extra for carry on at the airport
Me and my 5 pound, 21 inch baby dick over here
so whats a 12" dick here or there
I mean a baby can fit out of it
you never know
don't knock it until you try it
Why the fuck
Which
Only use you might have for a dick that's too long
Dick fencing
I don't need my cervix split open thanks
I'm pretty sure most vaginas aren't anywhere near 12 inches deep to begin with
there is such a thing as too large
lmao
exactly
At what point does it go from sex to being shish-kebabed
idk if I'd want to *take* one though
this is true
I know you'd be curious
What
come on, do you not want to hold a 12" dick
oh are you in
So
I'd assume they'd be willing
If we're doing the 15 dick challenge
I mean
but like. I for one would not swipe on anyone with that info out
If a dick isn't completely straight, do you account for curvature in dick measurements?
if you really wanna flex your dick size you can put it in your tinder bio
What Cindy said is also true
Interesting, yes
Good idea, no
I say it'd be wack bc people don't need more reasons to feel genetically superior to others
maybe for something like Tinder
I think I'd be interesting
so like 6' 2" could be 5' 6" and 8" or 6' 0" and 2"
I feel like that'd be kinda wack
I do not need to know that information
I was thinking a little while ago, what if we gave our height has height plus dick size
Rasputin dick
12 inch dick
5 foot tall guy
Probably a larger fraction in more extreme cases
Everything is measured in inches. Height can easily be converted into inches. Doing the division is scary sometimes.
wait what
Which is kinda wild to think about
Ok, but some people's dicks are like 1/10 of their height
outside your body lol
bc they're like
gene I feel like that's not true and people just notice penis size variation more
well yeah but what counts as a micro vagina
I feel like penises just have more size variation
not if it hurt everyone involved
But like *micro*
yes they do
I feel like it's generally seen as a better thing to have a smaller/tighter vagina though
yknow jarrett I have no idea
Especially since dick length is measured when erect
Do micro vaginas exist?
Parents checking on their kid's dick to see if it's grown enough every now and then is really wack
Question
but can you even tell at that age
unless they're like really really young
would that not be kinda wack
the mental image of parents being concerned about their sons' penis growth
just
Children?
But
Ok
Testosterone probably
That
lmao
Uhm
what?
Imperial system is big brain move
Big brain to compensate for small dick
stupid people that use imperial
so micropenis are larger than I thought
Who measures penises with thirds?
Okay but it *really* shouldnt affect your workplace activity
micropenis is officially anything under 3 2/3 inches
That seems fair
Ok I guess a micropenis is a disability then
yeah
Is sex a major life activity?
Hm ok
yep it is
oh wait
oh I don't know if it is
oh I didn't know that
at least I would consider it
Hm ok
Really?
yes
*is* infertility considered a disability?
being tall or short doesn't impact your ability to procreate
If it is, then I'd say yes
I don't actually know
Is being too tall or short considered a disability?
yes but no one talks about it
Cause infertility would be considered a disability right?
Hesitant yes
I mean, maybe?
I don't think so?
is it a disability?
Discuss
Micropenises
So
Getting a Discord notification from nsfw that shows me that Noah sent a png, pinged Jarrett, and evoked an "oh god" response from Salina is probably is probably the most concerning thing that can happen as I prepare to open Discord
Lmao
Unfortunately I cannot be your first disciple since I cannot look at these while at work
Watch to cure yourself
Cant have gun violence here guys
You need to be the Messiah to bring this sacred ritual to cleanse this holy land

Oh god
<@173668455856340994> we need you
Again
I need an adult
Fair
It doesn't really help
This is like that one time you asked if it was ok to sexualize underage characters because the voice actors were legal but portraying someone younger than them
Well if we're being real Tom holland was 22 and Brie Larson was 28
<@173668455856340994> get your head out of the gutter
<@503787499605458954> you're right
Ok, so in assuming Carol's at least in her early 30s in Captain Marvel cuz she was serving long enough for her similarly aged friend to have a kid who was old enough to remember before going off and doing space things for 5-6 years, so let's generously say she's 32 in 1995. Add 28 years and she's 60 years old in Endgame. Peter is 15 in Endgame because he was snapped in Infinity War, which takes place like a week after Homecoming, which explicitly states that. She's four times his age.
*legally speaking*
jarrett is a interesting character
i agree
<@340319804747415553> Jarrett's messed up, and we're discussing how messed up he really is
You'd think her powers would make her age faster if anything since she basically absorbed a bunch of wacky energy. Everyone was surprised that she didn't die. I'm surprised that shit isn't aging her like nuclear radiation.
Wtf is happening
in human years
but like, she's at least 50
I assumed bc of the powers n all she doesn't age normally
So
1995
How old is she??
What the fuck
I forgot that was the 90s
Wait oh dear God you're right
she was already an adult in the 90s and now it's 2024
only twice?
If anything, it's worse because Carol's the one who aged an additional five years and Peter did not. Not that it makes a difference because she's probably twice his age at this point.
He's still like a sophomore in Far From Home
Legally this is very much not alright
he was dead
So *legally* this is aight
oh that doesn't count
It was what four years later?
Assuming this is endgame fight scene though
p sure he was a freshman in smhc
nope he's 16
He's technically 19 i think
1. I need an adult.
2. Why would you show me this? Why would you ruin two of my favorite characters for me like this?
3. He's clearly underage. Whymst the fuck?
4. I pity Strange if this was one of the potential futures he saw.
Had it saved on my phone for about 3 months
I'll put it here
4cursed6me
3cursed5me
a very cursed argument
could make an argument that it belongs there bc of that
I mean
and therefore white sticky fluid
I think chocolate is really the way to go
especially if it's vanilla
but yeah, leave melted ice cream out of sex
it's still good. i mean, it's ice cream
but it sounds kinda gross
why would you
I have never specifically tried eating (drinking??) melted ice cream because like
the cold could add like a sensation play element to it, but idk how I feel about the ice cream melting
well I meant food in general not necessarily ice cream
it sounds cold
I have definitely talked about this before but I'm highkey into the idea
I didn't even think about the second
Sex with substances not directly pertaining to the act itself does not appeal to me
oh
is there just vanilla ice cream involved in the process, or are you literally having sex *with* the ice cream?
depends on how you interpret that
Lol
honestly that sounds really fun
sex with vanilla ice cream
what exactly defines vanilla sex
in the spirit of the channel we're in though
every dessert
there's a reason it's in like
vanilla is amazing as a flavor in general though
Other flavors are amazing too but I never get tired of vanilla
if I had to pick one ice cream for life it'd probably be coffee
<:NR:605639306572464128>
If I had to pick only one ice cream or yogurt flavor for life vanilla would be it
And vanilla yogurt
Vanilla ice cream is great
üëÄ
Yeah its pretty good
<@233062637922025472>
`Vanilla is great`
g i v e  h u g
I'm not like traditionally touchy-feely but I'm v tactile and v affectionate so there you go
practice makes perfect
I'm the best at hugs because I like giving hugs the most
1.5 is "below average" and 3.5 is "above average" before anyone decides to nit-pick that
the "bad hugger" range is 0-1
the "average hugger" range is 2-3
the "great hugger" range is 4-5
i don't want to have a reputation as a bad hugger but i also don't want people soliciting hugs from me
vanilla hugs are my goal
Vanilla is great
hey, idc what you say, but vanilla is great
Lmao
In hindsight, I would've gone with "It's a vanilla-flavored hug. Inoffensive yet ultimately considered plain. However, vanilla is still sweet and an amazing flavor. Fight me."
I was looking for the right analogy, but it didn't hit me at the time
Thank
i think my hug description is very accurate, good job gene
<3
I'm sorry?
Lowwww gradeeeee
Damn
<@503787499605458954> Irony, that's why
Hell, I gave you a higher score than I did myself.
Salina wdym you're squarely in the middle. How is that a low grade? This shit is bell-curved UW-style.
I‚Äôll take my low grade
Lmao
Why is this in nsfw this is the purest thing
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
No way I'm only .5 higher than Noah
Disclaimer: all hugs are good hugs, so don't let this stop you from giving more hugs
I expect these ratings to be very controversial, so please don't kill me
**Chopped into three messages to fit Discord's constraints**
Cindy: 5/5. What more can really be said about Cindy's hugs that haven't already been said? Readily available, ultra-comforting, and always delivered with a level of quality and confidence that cannot be denied. A simple hug can Cindy can honestly sometimes just make your day. This is the gold standard.
Jane: 2/5. Again, concerns with consistency. Sometimes, it's just right and a perfectly solid hug. Others, it's just too awkward and hug just even fully take place because something is just off. The intent is there, and you occasionally get a great hug, so it's truly hard to complain.
Emi: 4/5. Another hug that merits plenty of recognition. It's readily available and can both pick you up on a sad day or elevate you further when you need to celebrate. Form is solid and confidence is almost never in question. In some ways, it's a no-nonsense version of Jiayi's hug, yet it never feels overly serious. However, in some ways, the hug is too adaptive, and you're sometimes unsure of what to expect. But to many, this is simply a style worth appreciating.
Starbot: 0/5. Bitch won't hug me
Gene: 2/5. Available in bulk, but admittedly awkward. It's like how you can buy something in bulk from Costco, but it's only aight, and you get sick of it every now and then. But there are some redeeming factors and it is always there.
David: 3/5. Some awkwardness and imperfect form holds this hug back, but there is confidence and commitment when you get it. David's build helps him a lot. If you're not into overly tight hugs, this is the hug for you. Friendly, pleasant, and honestly just really well presented.
Salina: 2.5/5. This is a hard one to grade. The hug is fairly accessible and delivered with confidence, but there is some occasional awkward positioning of form. Regardless, this is a comforting and reliable for when you're having a bad day.
Bethany: 4/5. You get a lot of variety with your hugs here, so the quality is admittedly inconsistent, which both works towards and against the hug's favor. However, the tone of the hug tends to match the situation. Form is solid, confidence is there, and it's really just whatever you need it to be at the time.
How good of a hugger you are (quality and quantity are both factored in, but the former more so, curved around a 2.5):
Noah: 1/5. Bitch refuses to hug me (and others) a lot of the time. When he does, it's half-assed and done with regret. I'm sure Salina gets better hugs than the rest of us do, but she ain't grading here. I've received worse hugs, so I'm not gonna give him a 0/5 though. 
Alan: 2/5. Solid form but somewhat limp due to the fact that he just doesn't wanna hug. He could be an above-average hugger if he committed and put in some effort. His form and body shape carry him from being an atrocious hugger.
Helen: 2.5/5. You get what your asking for, and it's much appreciated. This is a fairly standard hug, but it is the standard. She's willing to give them to you and she does a pretty solid job. Maybe I haven't gotten many hugs, but nothing particularly stands out. However, nothing is done wrong. Everything is just right.
Cole: 2/5. I'm working with short sample size here since I've hugged him once. It was a little awkward. I feel like it's be a 3 if I tried to hug him again since I pretty just ran up to him after a performance like one time. Again, I'm sure Jane gets better hugs, but she ain't grading.
Jarrett: 1.5/5. An awkwardness pervades this hug, but it's readily given to you, and he truly means well. This could be bumped up to a 2 on a good day.
Jiayi: 3/5. This is a hug worth pursuing. I would bump it up to a 4 if it were easier to get an unironic hug out of him. It seems like half of the hugs with Jiayi intentionally take an awkward, ironic turn. But hey, that's part of the fun of it. Form is great, and this hug just really melts into you. It's also readily available. Go Jiayi!
Technical difficulties please stand by
I'll only use people who are semi-active here
I might use decimals for people
Yeah
1-5 is easier
that would probably be easier
sure
Can I grade 1-5?
if you're already going to subconsciously do it why would you add a layer of intention to further exaggerate the effect
Actually
I can do it, I'm just saying some people have preferences
A 5/10 is an F
Like a 4's not that bad, but it sounds terrible
Cuz thats just what people subconsciously do
no u
No use 5
Why would 7 ever be average
I can grade y'all on a curve to be nicer
<@472541429130854421> do you want me to rank hugs from 1-10 with 5 being the average or 7 being the average?
i look at people's ears a lot because people tend to not look at them
if i had to pick something weird to rank, i could do ear shapes
so this is going to be like jarrett's shoulder rankings, except it's gene's hug rankings
Although I'm not sure I have enough reference
I have the sudden urge to everyone here by how good of hugs they give
Honestly, I've been lying in bed for the past two hours hugging various stuffed animals
Would still hug
But it's Hemsworth
Also, it's a fat suit, so idk how huggable that is
Rocket disagrees
Fat Thor is the most huggable you can‚Äôt change my mind
What
*glomp*
Again, I'm not picky. I'll hug any of them.
Pom is also adorable and heavily slept on though
I will say, I'm not picky, I will gladly hug any of them
HES SUCH A SOFT DAD
I do vote rdj
Or hugs in general lmao. I love hugs.
For rdj to hug me
That's really just what I want out of life
I wanna say RDJ, but I feel like I'm sleeping on a few other solid picks
Random wholesome turn cuz I genuinely don't know
Which MCU actor looks like they give the best hugs?
Truth
Chadwick boseman is fucking beautiful and highly underrated
Ok fair enough
They're hot, how novel
Movie stars
P much everyone let's be real
Him too
Oh, I forgot about RDJ somehow
I stg paul rudd drinks unicorn blood or smth he literally has not aged
I go back and forth on whether I'm extremely attracted to rdj or if I just want him to adopt me (young rdj was v much my type though)
Not particularly attracted to pratt or seb
I prefer cevans beardless
Borderline put Anthony Hopkins at the same tier as Tom
Pretty much everyone from the Thor movies is either attractive or old (but still aesthetically pleasing)
Everybody else I at least understand
I dont understand Tom Hiddleston
Okay
lol
Olay
Also, throw in Idris Elba and Tom Hiddleston
You wouldn't go gay for modern day Jesus?
Just Mr Stan though
Me
But like who wouldn't?
<@503787499605458954> if you wanna add to the list, I'd also go gay for Paul Rudd, Chadwick Boseman, Chris Pratt, Chris Evans (bearded is preferable, even though I don't like the look for the character), and Sebastian Stan among others
But I have standards nonetheless
Higher standards than I deserve to have, mind you
for me
bc that means it's not you
I have standards
yes
Would you go platonically homosexual with me?
There we go
One sec
Nvm, I'll just pin it
Actually
Cindy, would you mind pulling up that list again?
You're on your own here, buddy
What's this "we" business?
We can't lose to her Gene
I'm staying out of this
That a challenge?
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
though, it's a lot more normal for girls to seem a lot more "gay" so
I'm loyal
<@173668455856340994> no, but I won't stop you
I've slept with at least 3 of the girls in this group alone üòâ
Do I hafta give him a handy or something to make it count gene?
Slept
Talked
Watched a movie
Got in bed
We stripped to like our underwear or whatever
Although I have shared beds with many more men than I have women
Talking, that's kinda normal for a sleepover
damn
I'm not counting sharing a bed
I think 5 if you count the like hour and a half nap
<@233062637922025472> has it just been sharing a bed or talking all night in bed together
4?
3?
Also it's been more than 1
<@503787499605458954> I mean awake and talking the whole night. That's different.
I feel immensely hurt
What do you mean you got away with being friends with me
how
what
wait have you actually never slept in the same bed as a male friend
lmao cindy
(this is why ya take stats, guys. This is why ya take stats)
idk, I got away with being friends with jiayi for 3 years before his hubby came into the picture
Number of times Jiayi and Jarrett have spent the night in a bed with another man: 1
Number of times Gene has: 0
theyre a package deal
tbf theyre basically a married couple
LOL
lol
Scuze me?
To clarify something about the stats though:
-Jiayi and Jarrett have both kissed more men than I have
If I actually met my clone, we wouldn't get along. I hate myself lol
dont forget your socks
no homo
brojob
cough
I 100% would, I'd be too curious not to
Whats a little brojob between two guys
tbh i don't think i'd fuck my clone
piping hot tea
I mean, let's look at the stats again since numbers don't lie:
-I've had the same number of romantic relationships with men as I have with women.
-I've been rejected by less men than women.
-I have hundreds of thousands of clones of myself who I occasionally jokingly pursue relationships with. 100% of them are male (since, they are, well, clones).
Everytime the baker dude showed up on screen Gene whispered to me "swol boi"
How dare he imply that I'm less attractive than the hot anime baker dude
i'm hopping onto the gay train too
question of the day: who would fuck their clone
if you were my only option for being straight
idk if gene 2 counts though
trust me
yes
Or rather
How dare he imply that I'm less attractive than Simu Liu and Tom Holland
what are we at, like, 6 to 1?
lmao jarrett
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Rude
working list of people gene would not go gay for:
-jarrett
i think he might be more attracted to them than *I* am
i agree
I'm starting to think gene's more attracted to men than I am
His face is p cute too ngl
lmao
-simu liu (abs.)
oooh right
And myself
Simu Liu too
hahahahhaha that noah rationale
get the fuck out
working list of people gene would go gay for:
-chris hemsworth (understandable. like, would not trust people who would not)
-tom holland (iffier but still a hot piece of ass)
-hot anime baker dude (hey, he's p thicc)
-noah (I don't have a justification for this one)
A lil polygamy anyone?
what happened to trying to seduce noah
lmfao
I'm straight. If Jarrett is my only option, I'm definitely straight.
L M A O
Depending on your answer
No
Hit me up Gene
I mean
What
you sure you're straight
gene
hmmm
Me: What's he doing with the baking pan? That's p unnecessary.
Jiayi: He's just trying to impress the cat.
Me: Well, I mean, this man doesn't need to do anything more to impress me, that's for sure.
Jiayi: *concern*
<@!233062637922025472> can you confirm
lmaoooooo
I spent like half of the movie yesterday talking to Jiayi about how the swole baker dude was p damn attractive
you tried though
it really doesn't
I now realize this doesn't help my case at all
Upon rereading that
alright fine
self *discovery* huh
;)
self-discovery and all that
Cindy, this is why we need context
a lot can change in a short time period
and now you're into choking?
Nothing
gene i leave for a bit
happening
what is
Maybe he was going for an 80s look
fair, but if that's the case why would he not remove the excessive oils from his scalp
The bitch can change his appearance at will. If that isn't everything you could ever ask for in bed, then idk what is.
tom hiddleston is fine af but I can't get over the hair
he's too much of a greaseball
LISTEN i know I've said this but I cannot see loki as that attractive
I'm more into being Loki. I'd die to be that hot. üòâ
Excuse you
ideally with an infinity gauntlet
new tea, gene is into being choked to death
fun
hello? police?
<@470822754262712329>
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little \"clever\" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
Also <@470822754262712329> I'll miss you :(
(it's because sports are a joke to them, so they wanted a joke mascot)
Because people like drawing dicks
Oh my God why
Art people
Ahhhhhhhhhhh yes
TIL the risd mascot is a literal dick
Oh nooooo
rip starbot
aw
I have Azure for a while if that helps
(but he'll return one day, eventually...)
though he's gonna kick the bucket tomorrow because my amazon web services trial expires
you're welcome
<@!478706068223164416> this is amazing thank you
<@173668455856340994> no
oh my god
**FBI OPEN UP**
LOLI
**FBI OPEN UP**
I feel like having underage loli voice actors wouldn't just be an ethical problem it would be a federal fucking issue lmao
**FBI OPEN UP**
Is loli hentai more ethical knowing that the voice actors are all 20 and above?
what?
Rip
<@520095106888630348> but unlike a true twin, he's not trying to actively get rid of me
I‚Äôm back bitches
Hi
he could get a bert
That's the most important part
Also, he doesn't have Bert
Who doesn't hate themselves?
I think that's a given
Oh yeah
me: I hate you all
You and Andrew: I hate me too
Nor did he wear matching clothes or confuse my name for his
And we never spoke in unison
He said like 3 words to me tbh
i thought you had a new twin thing with Andrew
ugh
.......
<@520095106888630348> WE'RE POTATO TWINS!!
YEAH
i'm bored and lazy
ayy me too
How about yourself?
I'm actually doing alright. Just bored and lazy/potatoing. Thanks for asking.
Gene you okay there buddy
Lol
God dammit, it's like trying ask my parents about something.
<@470822754262712329> well?
sure
<@470822754262712329> would you like to answer that?
<@470822754262712329> woah, hold up, you're definitely not 18 years old. What are you doing in here?
that's it, I'm getting me mallet
<@470822754262712329> idk which channels Alan gave you permissions to
<@470822754262712329> are you allowed in here?
Me: I feel like it's been a while since we've been degenerates. When was the last time? I should check the nsfw channel.
Discord: It's been about 6 hours
i feel like that dip is rather unatural
while slender yet muscular shoulders are quite nice
second
first of all i feel very kink-shamed by the comments there
well
https://v.redd.it/wornmtm5gec31
<@173668455856340994> what are your thoughts
"sand noodles"
Or as an old friend of mine used to say
OMG this is such an old meme
S E N D  N E W T S
i'm sure he's a harmless guy but whatever
missed opportunity
deleted him already tho
lol
just send him a glorious newt pic
?
just do it
O_o
newts
newts?
send newts
wack
Wonder how he found my account
Some rando added me on Snapchat thinking I would like to exchange nudes
I dunno
Some singer woman
Who is that?
I have found a person with nigh perfect shoulders
Attention all
But it's probably the point
Indeed
This sounds very psychopathic
While looking someone in the eye to assert dominance apparently
something about jerking off while running?
Believe me, I wish I didn't know what they were talking about
sometimes i wish i knew what you guys were talking about and then i think about it more and realize that it's good i don't know
It's gay if they keep watching
maintain eye contact
Just start jacking off
assert dominance
Just let it run its course?
What you gonna do?
You get an awkward boner right
Aight
<@258094439636008971>
https://old.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/cdumto/whats_up_with_videos_of_women_jumping_on_cameras/
sometimes it's just WTF
but sometimes
you know I really like r/OutOfTheLoop, it's a great place to figure trends going on the internet that you're lost on adn don't understand
Sigh
You can live without it
You should if you're a guy
I don't think anyone really needs to know this
Well not this specifically
You might need to know this Ms Nursing student
All about that blood flow
Same with bending your knees
Alternatively if you can't do something that noticeable stretching works too
and i didn't need to know that
oddly specific
that is
...
Alternatively jump up and down like 4 times
Problem solved
Just run like 20 meters
Like if youre out and about and you get an awkward boner
We do not run naked
I run with jiayi
you're gonna have to explain
?
don't you run?
But the whole running with a hard on is honestly a good strat
Cant speak much to the flopping thing
@everyone someone else want to share their thoughts/experiences
Let's not discuss this
Never mind
No, just like
it doesn't really hurt though
yea it's not exactly comfortable
holding it defeats the purpose
This hurts to think about
you gotta let it flop around
no that would be cheating
Is "the moment" supposed to mean my dick? Cuz now is most certainly not the time.
seize the moment
I'll go back to laptop browsing thank you very much
well it's nice and dark out now
I have not gone out running stark naked
you're obviously not spending them well
<@!258094439636008971> you've had 18 years to experiment
I guess everyone just dealt with it
When the fuck did you experiment with "running with your dick flailing around"?
idk
so to answer your question
lol
running with a hard on is even harder
well it's not easy
can't say I have
<@193229269076279298> ... Have you?
<@!503787499605458954> you ever tired running with your dick flailing around
Hell, when was most clothing invented
I have never considered this before just now
When were bras invented?
midnight crackhead soliloquy over
idk man
/straight up painful during any kind of physical activity
bc I hate bras and I don't even have big boobs but it's also kinda uncomfortable to just let em loose
functioned
girls do y'all ever wonder how cavewomen like
You have to suffer with the rest of us
No, you do
Lmao I didn‚Äôt need to know this
Hahahaha I love this
This was very important information
Because when it shook the door opened so I thought my parents were walking in on me masturbating at 3 in the morning
No it scared the shit out of me
thanks jiayi
LMAO
I don't want to be that dude that dies jerking off
I would be very sad if I died in that earthquake
<@503787499605458954> relevant
Currently roasting sausages and the phallic imagery is a bit much
are you sure? ;P
hey I'm not doing it for any of you, so you can shut it
still a fall from glory
I'm happy with it
hey it means my traps are getting better
"45-90-45 triangle"
but i am VERY entertained by noah's fall from shoulder glory
idk why
I don't know if I have a type, so Jarrett's probably not my type
idk if that's a "fetish" or just a type
I have a Jarrett fetish ;)
For example
Yeah, there are indeed a lot of different fetishes
Would never date a clingy princess-type girl or guy
Strong, free willed girls are infinitely more attractive than clingly helpless ones
True statement though
not everyone has to have really out there fetishes like you <@!472541429130854421>
don't gatekeep his fetishes
that can totally be a fetish
Oh gosh stop
That's not a fetish
I mean of of course this is all secondary to my fetish for strong independent women
rip?
Also being told "you going great my dude" for my shoulder fetish is a first for me
It's just that I dont want to be saying like center-bone or front-bone cause it sounds a little dumb
<@503787499605458954> I think one example of that is in Marina's recent album cover, look that up. She has very bony shoulders so everything shows
Has this been a shoulder update
Even if I have no idea what you're talking about, you go do you, cuz you doing great, my dude
Respect tho
I don't understand how you can have a fetish for something you need such technical terms to describe sorry Jarrett lol
collar bone plus the nubs at the far ends of your shoulders
I kinda don't want to leave my room and turn lights on to check a mirror
I mean I searched it up but I'm confused as to how it actually shows
I feel like I might've asked this already but what is the clavicle-acromion joint
Just go flex on Jiayi for still having better shoulders than him
You're taking this in the wrong light <@193229269076279298>
<@!173668455856340994> I'm sorry you don't appreciate the work I've been putting into my shoulders
5 is average in the fact that they are neither attractive nor unattractive
Is 5 the average or is 7 the average?
Updated shoulder ratings after going to the beach with y'all
Noah: 3/10 fuck your buff ass shoulders Noah. They're lumpy in places and your shoulder and neck literally make a 45-45-90 triangle. Additionally, your acromion joint sticks out even amongst your muscles livke Everest among the Himalayas 

Gene: 5.5/10 while nicely shaped, your shoulders are quite large in general as is rather common among guys of your height. To another shoulder-lover they could be quite nice, however feminine shoulders is what I dig, even on guys

Alan: 7/10 surprisingly very nice. Slender, lithe, muscled but not too much, nor bony either. A nice little medium point, edging on the good side. An all-around solid set of shoulders

Emily: 5/10 in terms of size, your shoulders score quite well. However, in the shape category you lose points due to the rather squarish angles that they make when they taper off into your arm. However because your fashion choice is exceptional, (especially those shirts that run across the neck and check but leave a hole for the shoulders) depending on the day you can easily score a 7 or 8/10

Myself: 3/10 I actually believe myself to have quite unsightly shoulders because my upper shoulder is rather bony in addition to the fact that my upper arm does not have a good ratio with them, making them seem too large at times
Jane: 5/10 shoulders are proportionally rather large and rather square-shaped and your neck doesn't create a very sharp angle with the shoulder

Cindy: 6.5/10 while shapely, your clavicle-acromion joint protrudes upwards from your shoulder a bit more than I personally like 

Helen: 8/10 quite exceptional shoulder in my opinion due how it tapers off into the arm as well as an overall good general curvature

Salina: 8.5/10 while very similar in proportion and shape to Helen's shoulder, a slight edge is given for the vaguely smaller front to back width as well as a slightly better neck-shoulder connection appearance

Jiayi: 2/10 while the shape/height combo makes it very nice to rest my head upon, your shoulders are rather bony and do not have a nice, plump appearance that is inherent to the rest of this group minus me. Much of a shoulder's rating lives and dies by plumpness.
bc he agrees with the insult I guess
idk noah wants to
it says something that i'm saying this because usually i favor the logic based answer
I'm confused, but why would you bother to agree to someone's self-insult to begin with?
i think for a lot of ethics related things you can't really analyze everything to get the best answer or argue for how you're right. In the end what's ethical to say or not just depends on how people feel about it, and debating whether someone should feel a certain way never works in your favor
the notion is that you shouldn't agree with someone who puts themselves down or is trying to be humble
well, alan said it was an extreme example, and person A mentions that they're not very good
agreeing with an insult is still asserting that the insult is true
in my example I'm just agreeing with their insult
you can think whatever you think but when you say it it's a different matter
in this case you are adding your own insult "Yeah you're trash"
yeah i think it's kinda mean to agree with that
was very pointful of you
wait that doesn't make sense
thank you for pointing out my point
Oh
that's the point
yes gene
It's completely fine until you add in the "Yeah you're trash"
extreme example but same concept
"Yeah you're trash."
"Oh, no I'm not that good at ping pong. I've just played a little with my family, that's all"
I'm with Cindy on this one
which only works if you're already friends
think about it this way
unless in like a friendly/teasing way
it's a dick move for someone else to back it up
it's ok to say shit about yourself
I'm merely agreeing with it
well she said to about herself
but I also wouldn't agree with how readily she accepts it
you're not supposed to agree or disagree
I won't say she's wrong about it
disappointing
don't be a dick
yes
is it insulting to say yes I agree you're Vegas trash
anyway
it's not very good
never used desktop Instagram before
https://www.instagram.com/p/BzUCHWHlDSz/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link
it's a shame I can't be everyone's friend
I imagine I might've been able to help her with some of her problems, but the hands of fate said I wasn't the one to do it
what is there to agree/disagree on in her insta post?
(Kimi Raikkonen)
I can kinda relate to that
Ice man is only on Instagram
tbh in spite of everything she's def one of the people I wish I became better friends w in high school
Agreed
also, you use social media??????????????????
I hope she finds peace some day
what was it
oh yea I was talking to Gabe about her today, the hypothetical good or bad idea of agreeing with her on her latest Instagram post
I also strongly get the sense that her friends don't actually give a shit about her
Look who's here
idk, but I'm 99% sure that was a thing long before she was a hoe
no idea how it started tho
I don't know her parents
i know her mom heavily disapproves of her
Damn, really?
I feel kinda bad for her
also I definitely think her behavior is bc of her relationship w her parents
That sounds like information I don't think I need tbh
pls spill
tea?
there's my slight addition to the tea
also I keep hearing about who she's fucked @ jsa conventions
5th grade chubby gene
it's gonna be weird
she's going to school w me
Lmao
5th grade emo alan
Oh
a n y w a y s
helen said she stole michelle's look and I strongly advised against associating with her
How did we even get to this topic?
Lmao Helen
Michelle included mind you
He's super nice. I just keep forgetting people exist cuz of graduation.
what happens in #nsfw needs to stay in <#503796012285165568>
Don't tell him I said that
I forgot Sasin existed for a while sorry
i remember a point in eighth grade when she seemed obsessed with sasin for some reason
cool guy, but needs to wear deodorant more ffs dude
why sasin of all people
oh nvm
sasin?
ryan voigt
Yike
if you can say
who?
she had a crush on my homeboy for several YEARS and would not let up even after he rejected her
i just hope it's not something borne out of negativity, but apparently her relationship with her mom isn't great
Uh
I don't know her too well either
maybe a lack of affection from parents or neglect
she doesn't want to live to be middle aged
Well, I mean, alright I guess
I don't know her well enough to give a reason as to why she's this way
i can't understand her life choices but it's interesting
rip lmao
actually i was
michelle dated one of my home boys and we all gave him crap for "don't stick dick in crazy"
i'm not surprised
Damn wow I'm shook
michelle lee
she says she's going to do videos
Wait wait time out who and what are we talking about
ok that doesn't surprise me
yeah she gets money from guys now
Woah what
like whose dick she's sucked
I heard something like she's selling nudes to some guy on craigslist
like?
i follow her spam insta and she spills a lot of tea
there was an entire meme going around about people reporting snapchat hoes to the IRS for undeclared income
tbh i think michele does something like that
I don't think it's made explicitly for nudes
L
LMAO
no pun intended???
and it's made explicitly for nudes???
yeah
that's a thing???
exp. in as short of a sentence as possible
Oof
it's a thing where people pay money to add someone on snap so that they can receive nudes
^
if they do, then snapchat is bad at advertising
I don't have Snapchat so idk
no one spends money on snapchat, right?
i don't even know what $5 premium snapchat means
That means a lot
Jkjk thank you
I... agree with Alan
I said everyone's opinion who I CARED about, Helen, GEEZ
ouch
kinda vibe
michelle looks like $5 premium snapchat
i loved your long hair
I'm p sure quite everyone's opinion who I cared about at the time was either super apathetic about or hated my long hair
i hope she won't think i plagiarized her look
nononono
also i look hella like michelle lee
lighter hair color makes normally bad hair decisions more forgiving
speaking of hair, i have a middle part now and i actually like it a lot
Fredboat anyone?
same
i love that song
I'm sorry
THE TWENTY FIRST NIGHT OF SEPTEMBER
DO YOU REMEMBER
can't refer to "year" as in school years anymore smh
... I meant last September
it's just that I actually starting using product a little into this year
no I would say the same thing
not as dramatically as it has recently
sorry if that was an inadvertent insult lol
^
i thought your hair never changed?
lmao
s/o to 5th grade emo hair alan
per my understanding everything has been fifth grade
but hey I did end up asking her a dance, albeit seven years later
I'm so confused
Wait I thought you said you could never tell
bc there were multiple
wait at which point in time
Rip
I would've guessed that too if I were a bystander
yeah that's completely fair
alright, to spill the actual second part of that tea, i knew alan had a crush on me
you missed the one about toxic masculinity
3?
we had like 3 really deep conversations within those 10 mins
After we dropped you off when coming back from Bellevue
That'd be weird
Not the part where Alan was waiting
when was this
oh right you were in the car
The tea spilling
I merely observed all of this
lmaooo
i don't actually mind lmao
he confessed first
sORRY
lol
cindyyeyeyey
gah
more tea on my part
I remember distinctly wanting to ask her to a school dance one day
in fifth grade
I told him already
if i want to spill the rest of that cup, you were my first crush
Tea
if we want half spilled tea, I had a crush on Helen in 5th grade
oh hey a lurker
i think it's easy to confuse what i think i want vs. what i actually want
We're all running along a similar theme here, and I don't wanna derail that if that train is still going
Maybe if something comes to mind
if you want, I don't actually care
Do I have to contribute something now?
maybe they're someone who has spilt tea in the past, so let's allow them to redeem their credit lol
hahaha
Lmao
the freeloaders of society
Drinking the tea without spilling any
I'm sure some are
lol that would be hilarious
Discord says there are 9 people online right now, and I'm wondering if anyone's just lurking
the reason i started talking to peter k again after a long time was because i was tired of my boring and relationship-less social life and wanted to try something new, so i started talking to people i used to talk to more
Yeah, I can definitely see how this would be uncomfortable
lol rip
same, except without the "back", and it would make everything more difficult instead of easier
That's valid I guess
but, at the time, major "this would be so much easier if I just liked him back" vibes
lol that would have been a trainwreck of a relationship
he and salina are a way better match like this cannot be understated
'cause I feel like we annoy each other a lot and have a lot of conflicting values
Oof?
tbh looking back I'm 95% sure the only reason he ever liked me was bc he didn't know me well enough at the time
If you don't mind me asking
How long was this a thing for you?
alright fair
it's been long enough
or does it not matter
nah idc anymore
at the time anyways
how much do you want us to bury this convo so there's no chance he'll see it
Piping hot tea
I totally felt that way @ noah
you got tea?
S p i l l
ok some of my tea I guess
It's interesting, I'll give you that
though the tea is that there is none
lmao
i don't think i've ever spilled this much tea at once lol
Exactly
Yeah, even if something does happen, maybe don't unless you want that level of commitment
there will be tons of guys who are my type at duke
and it's not worth it to get into a relationship at this point
but we'll only be here for 8 weeks and then we'll never see each other again
yeah i suppose
Although tbf, you only met him like a week ago tho, right?
I'm sorry about that then
if i don't like this guy then how high can my standards get
Ohh, ok, that makes sense
yeah like that
bc it'd be easier, I assume, and reassuring to know you can still feel that way
tbh I totally have
Why do you wish you liked him?
Sorry
I can't say I've ever had a similar experience
i don't "like" like him, or at least i don't think so, but i kinda wish i did
Idk anything relevant
what sort of tea
Any other tea to spill about Chris "Not Chris Hemsworth" [insert unknown last name here]?
lol
So I was confused why you were stalking a pro athlete in his mid 20s
The Mariners used to have a pitcher named Andrew Moore, so I got confused
Oh lol
LMAO nerf wars
Wait a minute
andrew moore is one of the baseball dudes we stalked
ah
chris is white
Who's Andrew Moore?
is this guy white
for a white guy that is
the best example of a male face that is my type would be andrew moore
I'll just picture him as Chris Hemsworth until you figure out how to describe him
No worries
his fb profile pic doesn't do him justice
i would send a picture but he doesn't have many
I would ask if you had a picture of him, but I just realized that's a little creepy to ask
You played yourself, Cindy
L M A O
lol
I'm just giving suggestions lol
actually this guy is also called chris lmao
I asked helen not you gene
Sorry lol
C h r i s  H e m s w o r t h
physical appearance is harder to describe lol
I respect that. Idk how all those things manifest themselves when put together, but that seems p solid
for personality, i'd say someone who is reasonable, confident, has a good sense of humor, has good work ethic, and treats people fairly
This is quite the interrogation
Rip Helen lol
physical appearance?
Traits?
Personality?
Now I date a thirsty ho
what are some metrics
idk how to describe it
what's "exactly your type" I am curious
I thought I was ace for a while
F
Rip
oof
my internship partner is a cute guy with a great personality who is exactly my type, can i have a crush on him already
It was crisis-y at first, but eventually I was like, "I don't know, and I don't care, so whatever happens happens"
i may still be ace, who knows
hey same
I actually thought I was ace for like part of freshman and most of sophomore year tbh
nothing has changed since then but i've stopped worrying about it because it's tiring to be sad
lmao
one of the things i've always wanted to be a part of my life is having a good romantic life/marriage, but i haven't liked anyone in over four years so i thought i was ace and felt terrible about it
Wdym?
oh?
around sept/oct last year i had a crisis about this kind of thing
Gonna be completely honest, my parents interrogate me about every friend who isn't a guy at this point
I still did great in school bitches
Oh well
i don't think that's the same thing <@!503787499605458954>
But lol nah
and hated that she had a bf in senior year
My parents are like wtf about me dating
or at least, these days my mom interrogates my sister about all the boys in her life whenever she's around
Oof I'm sorry
My parents assume I can start dating whenever I want to and just don't want to yet, and I find that notion hilarious
<@!258094439636008971> my parents are kinda like that
i agree with this logic
my mom encourages me to start dating slowly in college, and make a point to get to know everyone before picking one person to hang out with more
Oh, ok, that's good lmao
nah my parents aren't like that
Lmao parents who go from "omg why are you dating" to "omg why haven't you started dating yet" between high school and college are the worst
i even had to cancel some hang outs with regular friends, much less have time to go on dates
dating does take a lot of time
it's because i had to focus on academics in high school
wack
they're fine with me dating as much as i want during college tho
ah rip
my parents definitely wouldn't allow it
wait why
I've avoided getting into a relationship while having a crush before, so I don't think those things are mutually exclusive
if there was someone i really liked who asked me on a date, i think i would feel terrible later because i couldn't physically go on a date
It really fucking depends on the person and situation lmao
I have no idea how I would react to actually having a crush
because i was avoiding getting into a relationship i also never had a crush on anyone in hs so maybe this situation couldn't have happened
Actually, I take back what I said
tbh i have no idea what i would have done if someone i liked said they also liked me during high school
wow that's a weird thing to consider
Yeah probably
if given the opportunity and the right person do you think you would have been in a relationship in high school?
The only time I've been aware of people liking me are girls who are overtly socially awkward
wow
I had someone who I had know for like a week try to reach for my hand and do the hold "fingers interlaced hand holding," and I'm like "woah, ok, we literally just went over how I only learned your name 3 days ago"
i think most guys who like me are the type of people who are afraid to confess
hahaha
Most people don't like me, and the people who do come out of left field, and I'm like, "dude, woah, I'm still learning your name, chill out"
i just have nothing to go off of
also i've never had a real crush who i've interacted with a lot while having a crush on them before so i have no idea what to expect other people would act like in that situation
It's not stressful for me cuz it's usually p straight forward
because i'm bad at it lol
also it's stressful to keep evaluating my interactions with people to figure out who likes me
Interesting
I feel like I tend to just assume it doesn't happen/people aren't serious
Ah
like you're thinking about them a lot, you like them for they're personality too and not just their looks, so you've probably already interacted a decent amount
see it's easy when it's just attraction
some people try to hide it when they're really into someone
At what point is someone *seriously* into someone tho?
weirdly I'm really bad at telling when someone is like *seriously* into me
unless they're obvious like Jeffrey who is kind of afraid to talk to girls but talks to me anyway
Oof
Same tbh
or maybe they just don't üò¶
i can almost never tell when someone likes me lol
I met her in a summer WANIC class, and we exchanged contact info (cuz I exchanged contact info with a shit ton of people), and whenever I spoke to her after that, I always started wondering "I'm not sure if you like me or are just really nervous about talking to be people"
ahahahahaha
I'm like 80% sure this sophomore at Eastside Catholic was trying hit on me for like the better part of senior year tbh
i liked him at some point but there's really no point in dating rn
he still sends me pictures and stuff and i reply
rip
a little bit, not much anymore
if yes you should hit him up
Rip lol
date never happened tho lol
do y'all still talk
originally met during a robotics competition a heck of a long time ago
ohhhhhh right
cindy you've heard about this before, there's a guy called Peter K who went to Eastside prep hs
***S P I L L  T H E  T E A,  S  I  S  T  E  R***
lmao
And just boom
You need to channel your inner Jason voice
You said it wrong
No, no
spill the tea sis
also what is this
Wait what lmao
no
does it count if someone asked you on a date and you said yes but the date never actually happened
~~Now someone invent a time machine and explain this to freshman Gene~~
I feel like a legit date implies spending time w just that person
you're surrounded by other people the whole time
it's a "you're my date to this event" type of thing not a "will you go on a date with me" type of thing
Usually not per my knowledge, but it depends on the context
I would say no
you know that's a good question
Depends on the context, but I don't believe so?
does like prom count as going on a date
It's probably the same if not
Have you done anything dramatic since?
but last time it was somewhere like 95
idk what my rice purity score is
There's only so many things to be said there
I have a 96
I never had much to spill lol
idk what tea I have left to spill
Jarrett made me take off my shirt to examine my shoulders
literally I've showed y'all my rice purity score point by point
nah just discussing
Are we?
We're not prepping lol
Well, I guess Noah asked everyone "what's your plan?"
this is an awful lot of preparation for a game lol
When does anyone ever really wanna know?
Ok, but like
Cuz we only had one person actually use their one pass (which was me, cuz I'm weak), so I'm guessing this means there wasn't any tea to be spilled
(mostly bc I didn't want to know)
no one asked anything super nsfw
lol
we didn't really
Idk if we had spicy prompts last time
where did you get the spicy prompts last time then?
i guess we could do that
It's what we did at the bonfire
And then you move onto the next person
Per my understanding, you ask one person anything you want for a given period of time
But we lack spicy prompts
how do you play that
We could play hot seat again
Scraping the bottom for the barrel here
eh
Idk
Fuck, marry, kill, but with names without any people attached to said names
What if
i think so
yes
Are certain names attractive?
i mean we could always resort to interesting discussion questions that aren't necessarily nsfw
Hmm
what's something spicy
<@472541429130854421> true
Those could technically have large-ish volumes
One that's really short but really girthy
Or like
Like a dick that's basically a 9-inch twig
we should come up with new topics
But what about anomalies
I thought we all agreed
How do you guys feels about Noah's proposal to measure dicks based off of their volume?
<@!472541429130854421> I know I sent you health videos bc you asked but now I'm rewatching them and feeling bad about myself lmfao
i'd love to have a discussion but idk any topics
Anyone got any spicy nsfw topics?
Gaaaah, I need to stop with sappy boi hours. I'll see them again one of these days anyways.
aww
They went out of their way to make me feel included and validate what I did for Skyline band, and idk if I ever properly told them how much I appreciated it
there we go
oh luis for sure
Same
i'll miss luis's long discussions in every class lmao
Iconic band duo
I miss Luis and Jody
Speaking of people we weren't particularly close with but miss
heh
Your skin's really nice too tho. Don't sell yourself short.
Lmao, thanks, Cindy
grrrr luis
In a friendly way of course
The one time I had a noticeably bad zit, Luis was the only person to call me out on it
be proud
your skin is so fucking nice
Maybe band is the reason I'm self-conscious about my skin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPxIssabhTc
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0La27FNrA4
make it sound really terrible
please send me a bunch of reasons to stop eating a ton of sugar and gluten
i need to fix my diet somehow
i support this decision
lol
good call
I'm gonna go wash my face right now
it's more important to do it at night for skin health
Ya know what
wash your face in the evening before you get tired
lol middle school boys
I wash my face in the morning and am too dead inside to do it at night
I remember freshmen year in band, I was talking with some other people, and Jody noticed my skin and was like, "omg Gene you're skin is so soft what do you do" and one of the guys there was like "lmao do you use lotion" and they all started talking about how gross is felt and how little respect they had for people who do, and I just kinda laughed awkwardly and slowly moved away from the circle
damn
i regularly skip morning washes when i don't have to
once when I get up and then in the shower
personally I feel p gross if I don't wash my face at least twice a day
washing your face at the end of the day is the best time
washing twice a day would really only be for cosmetic purposes
that's not necessarily a problem
Only once a day tho. I should probably be doing it twice a day.
I think it's a cleanser yeah
do you use cleanser
honestly that's more than most guys
what else would you add?
tbh that's all you really need to do
I wash my face and use lotion. The rest has to do with genes and shit.
I don't really do much to take care of it
It looks fine, but that's mostly genetics working tbh
unless it's drastically changed in like the last two weeks
also what are you talking about gene your skin looks great
lol idk
Would you like to continue discussing asses?
this needs to be in sad boi hrs
I asked about asses
also why did we ever get into nsfw
i have a landmine of small pimples right now
same my skin looks like shit
And take better care of my skin
I need to fix my diet
F ok yeah
as long i don't continue to down sugar and get diabetes
i think i'll age pretty well
Cut me open and drink my blood if you want to live forever
My blood is literally the fountain of youth
haha nice
My brother is 31, but he still gets carded when he tries to buy a drink
yeah i agree, especially your mom
They actually both look p young
But like
My dad's nearing 60 and my mom's in her mid 50s
my dad also, i suppose
my mom aged well
My family's all aged pretty well
except one aunt and my grandma
Interesting
all my family members are skinny
I'm pretty sure that as long as I don't put on too much weight, I'll look fine
I don't know a single male family member who's fit in the American sense of the idea, so idk what that says for me if I were to work out
doesn't mean it will happen though
some day i want to have abs
Helen be swole af
though gaining weight has thrown off the proportions a bit
my legs just have even more mass i suppose?
How are you bottom heavy and have a decent amount of body muscle at the same time?
compared to other girls who don't work out a ton i have a decent amount of arm muscle
i'm just a very bottom heavy person so my arms don't have a chance
Remember those fucking push up things from middle school PE?
I am more muscular now tho lol
We all had a pushup session in P3 English this one time
Idk anymore now tho
I used to be able to do 45
Rip
not even during my peak athleticism
i still cannot do pushups
*laughs in 100% just fat*
same i hardly work out these days and i love snacks so i'm glad for the mileage i can get lol
for guys a nice ass mostly relies on muscle, for girls it could be muscle or fat if she has good fat distribution
I shouldn't be complaining. For the amount of effort I put into my appearance, I get pretty decent value out of it.
Lmao true
he actually works out tho
Tom Holland has a nicer ass than I do
Point still stands
I mean
but that's America
If Endgame's taught me anything, it's that America has a nicer ass than I do
Hey, I mean
lol rip
most guys have better butts than me so I say, guys please continue to not pay attention to them
It's hard to pay attention to something that's literally behind you at all times
boys of the world, y'all need to pay better attention to your butts
Alright, that's valid I guess
i think asses, just like any other aesthetic object, can be ranked on a scale
but I can say from experience that I have absolutely noticed a flat ass and it has detracted from overall attractiveness
you don't usually say "good" ass either, it's like "nice" or "fat" or "thicc" or smth
you just don't call it a "bad" ass
<@503787499605458954> and I had this discussion earlier and I want everyone else's opinions: is there such a thing as a "bad" ass? Cuz people talk about "good" asses all the time and just don't comment on the other ones. They just don't notice them. Does one's butt ever produce negative value, or is it always a 0 or a positive value?
I am too a child, therefore that makes this okay.
I'm the child
It's me
Helen! There are (technically) children here! How could you post this??
This is not safe for work
Why is planking relevant?
Oh
That's what they were saying
Vertical if you were planking
Granted, it's not gonna be a perpendicular 90 degrees either, but still wtf
Cuz a dick that points straight up or straight down is probably concerning
Don't you mean horizontal?
Who the fuck is out here saying dicks are vertical?
Night
g'night rocks
got it
No u
that's a rock telling you to go the fuck to sleep
A dust fell into
A diary feel into my eye
this time we're angry at existence
we angry boi hours now
is alan ok
oh boi
be a rockstar
be a star
be a rock
K Maners you can chill
be a rock
don't think about it too much
just be
it doesn't bother the trillions of rocks around the world
so why let existence bother you?
and have as much right to existing as anything else in the universe
you exist in this world
you're a goddamn rock
and stop caring about what you "should" or "shouldn't" be, or what people might expect to see out of you
just be your true rock self
we're all naught but spacedust
Did you just imply we are rocks
so you shouldn't care about anything but that
nobody's asking you to be anyone but that
just be who you are
just be a rock
stop caring about why you exist
be a rock
Night, maybe
And get paid
You forgot to get the show on
night yall
well, this convo's been wack
lol
**mic drop**
be a rockstar
moral of the story
We need sleep
definitely not on the scale of our shit
they don't care either
do other animals give a shit beyond survival and reproduction? not really that we know of
or many rocks
break one apart and it becomes two rocks
tbh I think about this a lot
and they don't care what happens to them
they're just rocks
or wage wars based on ideology
rocks don't whine about the reason for their existence
rock
a
being
besides just
because you can't even comprehend anything else
and you're fine with that
because you're a rock
because nothing matters to you
and be content with that
just be a rock
you're a rock
you can't be bored, silly
bored?
just be a rock
rocks have it easy
and it will bring about our end, I guarantee it
humanity alone bears the curse of curiosity
Measurement is a fascimile that gives us the impression of having an understanding and control over the world
and in the end we all die so nobody cares anyway
everything we do to organize the world is pointless
moral of the story humans are garbage
could you say the same for penii?
at least to an exact exact extent
at the same time
you couldn't measure two people in the same place
and combined with the gravitational field problem
and you'd only be sure for that moment
you'd have to measure everyone at the exact same moment
due to environmental factors, stress, hormones, or whatever else
one person's height as someone else gets measured might not be the same as it was before
what about the fact that humans are, as we speak, changing bodies
what about that
but the spine compression based on the differences in gravitational field around the world
scratch that one
Did you miss the feet flat on the floor part?
decompressed spine due to lower gravity
Fine, arms by your sides
tippy toes
*day
-_-
Your height changes throughout the say
Standing straight varies by person
what if I raise my arms
Feet flat on the floor, stand straight, lowest point to highest point
it's just... like. vertical length
height has no reason to be volumetric anyways
ok but we're not talking about height
Na, height is rather easy
I think inaccuracy of dick measurement is a relatively harmless mistake
how should we account for those differences in *actual performance* such that the metrics reflect more accurately the performance of the varying bases
When you measure a person's height, there are even more factors you're not accounting for
so I assume we're trying for exact here
if it's just for comparison's sake the easiest way would just be to estimate w math
^
volume
what DIFFERENCES does it make?
what if the base IS different
are we aiming for exact measurements or just for comparison's sake
well, what if the base is different
does the waterline matter if everyone has the same "starting point"
I don't think you want to pick someone from the same lot again
i think i'm on the market for a new bf
hi uh
But we're back to the waterline issue again
uh what
Oh we had the same idea
How about now of thoses clone a dick things but you fill the mold with water
oh that's smart
measure water
fill mold with water
create mold from penis
wouldn't be exact but it'd work
Hhhjjhhhjjk
I mean if water displacement doesn't work you could try mathing it
this isn't what i need to hear at 1 in the morning
oh jfc
....
yeah it's more up up and away than straight shot out
Then change the angle of the plank
Dicks aren't a nice 90 degrees to the body
Doesn't work like that always
So the dick is vertical
Standard length practice is to measure to the pelvic bone
a small tank
You have the dude plank over two chairs
or like
might have to use a bowl
how do you fit the whole dick in the water
ok I was just thinking about that though
Where does the waterline sit?
Lmaooooo
no peeing in the cup to cheat
that's honestly probably best
I agree with the water displacement method
I've argued volumetric measurement would be better before
shit u right
Throat expands eventually tho
yikes
they rank
everyone stick their dicks down the same person's throat
measure how much water displaced
Per the anatomy note, unfortunately monocles would not work on a lot of koreans
put dick in cup of water
Who measures the dick and how do you do the measuring
meta koreaness
which disappoints me because it would be a very korean thing if it was a thing
Monocles automatically dont work if you dont have a kaiser mustache
night gene! sleep well
the koreans haven't seemed to pick up monocles as of yet
what's the metrology question
G'night y'all. Enjoy Jarrett's shoulder ranking and Alan's glasses commentary
Monocles anatomically don't work if you don't have deep set eyes
I think ima head out for the night cuz the ibuprofen is starting to wear out, and I don't wanna wake up at 4 AM in pain again
I never got an answer to my metrology question
Two monocles
e
the real power mov
Agreed
c) monocoles
is that a) some people, imo, definitely look better with glasses than without, but it's very situational, and b) glasses definitely do not equal a "nerdy" aesthetic, they've become increasingly trendy in recent years actually
which got a little bit lost somewhere
my point
anyways
Oh no
beautiful
you all should have to suffer with me
lmao
also I scrolled down a little more on my bayo google search and found this
no it's actually <@!173668455856340994>
Nate Reich
I do like my current frames over my last ones though
Lmao
lmfao
well ok except alan
WHAT ARE THOSES
from when I was looking for frames
Tbh they look kinda tryhard to me
would peg exactly none of these as nerdy
i'm getting same nose syndrome from all of those photos
Who gets to do the measuring?
Yes nerdy
I have a pair of gold rounded wire frames that make me look like a korean exchange student
what is happening on this day
Librarian look
goddamn
We don't need literal dick-measuring contests in here
Noah send me nudes to make Salina jealous
would you pin her as "nerdy"
depends
maybe it's just against his principles to send nudes to you
Oh, that's what you're talking about
bayonetta wears glasses
that's what you said to me!
It is?
He has principles?
Big disappoint
it's against his principles lol
noah won't
It's Kenneth
Noah, I will delete your ass if you send your nudes in nsfw
They all are
That anime man is either 14 or 34
Dear God that's not how that works
Even if we were all 18, still good say no
Well you had to say you were 18+ to get in the channel
Especially if you go by the book cover Harry and not the movie harry
he looks like Joker
Some of us aren't 18 yet
I agree he looks like Harry potter
They're perfectly in theme with the channel
No one needs to see that
Harry Potter but more chic and cool look
<@193229269076279298> no, noah
I'd disagree
Kenneth low-key an Indonesian Harry Potter
Nudes are allowed in the channel
Its the nerdy look
~~fucking koreaboo~~
Kind of influenced by korea
see also: Kenneth Ruslim
I think it's getting more popular here too
case and point
So not EVERYTHING is ok in nsfw
mostly popular with koreans tho
While porn is apparently on the table for the nsfw based off of past exchanges, we cannot exchange nudes in nsfw
there's this trend going in the direction of rounded glasses
w h a t
octoanus?
If Noah can send the octoanus then let Alan do his thing
That's objectively false
That second photo I thought was Alan with some Snapchat filter again
I mean
I can send anythiong
it's nsfw
Cropped of course not
Alan, stop sending pictures of women in glasses in an nsfw channel lmao
alexa play under pressure
Well long knit sweaters that go over your wrists year
cindy that's beyond male fashion vocab
what about like cropped or ripped knits
you think knit sweaters automatically make someone bookish or nerdy?
this one DOES
So it just increases it
The knit sweater already gives off that kinda vibe
I would put that down as "makes me very uncomfortable"
Really?
would not put this down as "nerdy" or "bookish"
(I'm just playing devil's advocate here)
You're saying they can frame faces in a bookish/nerdy way?
So
strong disagree they can frame the face super nicely
bookish/nerdy isn't the only thing
also I disagree
that one moment where you're not wearing your glasses but you go to push your glasses back up but they're not there so you end up just poking yourself between your fucking eyes like a goddamn monkey
The only use for glasses for looks is to build up a certain type of aesthetic whether it be nerdy or bookish what have you, and that can be accomplished in different, better ways
Wearing either sounds like ass
i'm a contacts girl
I'll never change to contacts though
glasses suck
done poorly it doesn't do much at all
Like wearing them
Glasses suck in general
Eh, get in the way a lot
Sorry Salina: :(
I think glasses, if done right of course, can add a lot
Ah shit, here we go again
glasses on girls specifically
anyways in an attempt to save this conversation from it's imminent death
Particularly stands out
that sounds more like it
Usually there's one that like
But like
At least
only one?
Every dorm building has that one "weed floor"
maybe that one's a little easier to detect
well okay
same goes for marijuana
lmfao
how're they gonna stop you
I was surprised you're allowed to drink in your dorm if you're over 21
Enough
shhhh
how much alcohol do you think was involved
wait I love that
nice
Lmao
not wack but not preferable
The first think I find when searching up my dorm building is this: https://youtu.be/mXijn_cPL2Y
Communal bathrooms wack
yeah
esp if they have communal bathrooms
Because communal bathroom
I feel like floors rarely are
The floors are not
The dorm is co
wait are you still at wsu I'm confused
My dorm hall is co
I'm gonna be often, there are days where I'm uncomfortable changing around my stuffed animals
My current dorm is alternating gender floors so I'm just walking back shirtless from the shower
FREDBOAT WHAT HAPPENED TO MY LOFI
I would probably choose socialization
both
socialization or registering for classes
I'll live
and you have a fucking final
I should but also socialization
cindy has to get up early to nab class reg
if it's a girl I'm rooming with I'll probably go to the bathroom though out of my roommate's sake
Why us?
esp you two
cindy and noah
N o
The room doesn't
go to fucking sleep
The bathroom gets steamy and wet
also folks
99% of the time its not weird unless someone makes it weird
Oh
hotel
if I'm comfortable enough to room with you I'm comfortable enough to change around you
<@503787499605458954> "checked out" in the hotel way or the other way?
Lol, I just change in the room Gene
only the chaperones had a room and everyone would pile in grab their clothes and change in the open
we'd all been checked out at that point
the weirdness to people changing together graph is inversely proportional
Like no room
You fucking take turns with the bathroom if you're rooming
lol
LMAO yeah we did that every wintercon
Also everyone had their suitcases
We had like 20 people changing in one hotel room at one point in JSA
Like as a rule
Also, I don't think there's anyone I'm comfortable changing around
"dude we gotta go to uniqlo that shirt's bomb"
This is why I won't go to the gym with you, Noah
Mr Europe over there
high school PE is just like
apparently, idk
that's just junior high PE
Wait do you guys feel weird changing around other guys?
We're traumatized from changing around each other, cuz it brings back memories of smelling nothing but axe body spray
lol
there's no girls in real life
impossible
and I'm saying like "comfort and affection" as in like you're comfortable enough around these people that you don't care
when girls change around each other it's not weird at all
Real life sir
/s
jarrett lay off the anime
I'm not communicating this well but like
Man i see girls kiss each other on the cheek/head in a platonic way
Ok, well, I'm affectionate towards a lot of guys while we're clothed
it's called the "guy hug" for a reason
Being affectionate towards another guy is often seen as being gay toward another guy so
hahahahhaa
ok I'm not saying you have to be physically affectionate while lacking clothes
lmao
He was also quite gay and it was quite hot and we had no ac
Let alone affectionate towards them
we're all born naked and the rest is drag, folks
I'm not comfortable being around naked people in general
At least while we're naked
**caveman noises**
Was chilling at WSU with my temporary roommate shirtless the day I met him
because man have to be manly
rip
see now I'm sad for boys again
<@503787499605458954> cuz we're not comfortable or affectionate
sigh why does affection and comfort have to equal homosexuality
Wait wtf <@173668455856340994>
Let's go back to the caveman days
Cause then its not that we're changing together its that someone is getting blown
this is just making me sad tbh
Would not be caught dead in a changing room with another guy
now imagine the same situations with guys
I have seen my guy friends naked before, but not by choice and also not in at least a decade
we also share dressing rooms a lot when we shop
I mean we do but we don't care that much man
to hide WHAT
you're just in a hurry
to hide what jarret
some days
Yall dont have stalls or towels or something?
<@503787499605458954> gonna be honest, I almost wore a shirt when we went paddleboarding the other day, so like I guess you have a point lol
This convo
Lmaooooooo
like I used to swim with helen and april for example
*are you sure*
It's not what it looks like
rip?
I looked at my phone and the first thing I come back to is Jarret and Jiayi shirtless and Gene taking photos through the window?
I've seen a lot of my guy friends shirtless
Naked no
well, I'm sure y'all see each other shirtless a decent amount
Shirtless sure
Yeah guys dont do that
Ah when me and jiayi finish running on a hot day we'll just chill shirtless usually
Ok wait what
Are you saying most people take pics through the window?
I've seen the vast majority of my close female friends naked or in underwear
lmao
Wait, excuse me
If we go running we'll change or whatever
I think you just have more modesty and/or dignity than most gene
And you take creep shots of him through his window?
I have seen the man shirtless a lot
The man lives like 2 blocks away from me Gene
aou is peak long-haired thor
really? I also like him w long
Both
Short haired only though
<@173668455856340994> why do you have shirtless photos of Jiayi??
of the guys yeah hemsworth def wins
<@503787499605458954> he falls under "not improved, just different"
Hemsworth objectively the most attractive of the bunch
lol
for the girls
dresses
H o w
Gene I had everybody else's unclothed shoulder
but not my type
he cute
Pretty nice Alan, you show them off well with the towel
weirdly, I don't usually find cevans that attractive
Uh hang on I need to see what he looks like again
like
fellow marvel nerds do yall know what I'm talking bout
<@173668455856340994> you didn't have anyone else's nude shoulders
anyways the best example I can think of of glasses making someone more attractive to me is probably chris evans in that one scene from CA:WS
<@!173668455856340994> I sent you my nude shoulders where's my verdict
Big sad
I need some nude ass shoulder from you Gene
Damn I hate Costco styles rn
Rip
^
outside Costco, not many do
Rip that's all I can afford
I don't think so
Do they sell like sub-100 things?
the frames on my face were $250
uh I'm not a good person to ask bc I add a shit ton of stuff
I own 3 pairs of absurdly expensive glasses bc of it
Like the marked price
<@173668455856340994> I showed you shoulders pls respond
insurance covers all
$0
Cindy how much does it cost you?
Ohhhh ic lol
it used to just be eyes on the city
the funny thing about my new frames tho is that the brand is "Alan J"
I think they changed it recently
For instance, Keira Knightly is too hot to be fuckable, a different word should be used
1. "Cute" is not exclusively for people you wanna date
2. "Fuckable" is objectively not a cute word
Huh it's called eyes on sammamish
üëã
üëã
high five
same as alan
eyes on the city
<@503787499605458954> wait where did you get glasses?
by what is happening
baffled
lmao
WORDS MEAN THINGS
What
i am
stop
you're wrong
no
what
no
fuck
well
fuck is for people you wanna
It's such a cute word though
cute is for people you wanna date
^
fuckable is for anyone you wanna fuck, tf?
jk jk
how's your right hand feeling alan
strong disagree
Not hot people
Fuckable is only for cute people though
alan wants to fuck himself more now
this just in
People look better with glasses 50% of the time and just look different (but again, not worse) the other 50%
lmao
till I got new frames
I thought that about myself
Unless you've known them for a while with glasses and then it's just kinda weird
fuckable is well desserving of word status
Personally I feel that 90% of the time people look better without glasses
Rip
fuckable is a word
<@258094439636008971> why not?
fuckable should be a word
Oof my insurance for glasses sucks
"fuckable" should not be a word
sometimes when guys wear glasses for some reason my brain immediately considers them hotter
OK SEE
but it can make them less so
i don't think glasses make people eminently more fuckable in my book
200-300
I got glasses from Mod Pizza. Totally.
anyways idk like I think I personally look really weird without glasses but that might just be bc I'm so used to them
spendy
Eyes on the city I mean
What are their prices like?
I have never seen someone made worse by glasses unless they choose something objectively ugly to wear (I know that sounds like cheating, but like you know what I mean by "objectively ugly")
For a lot of people though, they look different but not necessarily better
And then of course a lot of people look amazing with glasses
**not that anyone noticed my new frames /s**?
also my fave spot
eyes on the city!
Eyes on Sammamish I think it was
I read that as "I got them from mod pizza"
about a week ago
I got my new frames from the place next to Safeway/Mod Pizza
as a concept it depends on the glasses for me
costco
Oh btw where do you guys shop for glasses?
I'm kinda neutral on em
I'm still looking for a new frame
I mean, of course it depends on the glasses, but like as a concept
they can be either a blessing or a curse
depends on the glasses and the person
i think that's all i have to judge
depends strongly upon the glasses
They're good?
i don't like glasses on me
eh
Also, how do you guys feel about glasses (on both genders)?
I liked it just being that though lmfao
oh nvm
I think that's the point
Ah shit you right
ends
it just
i don't think you finished jiayi's analysis
Also, that doubles as my day three pic
also jarrett
<@173668455856340994> that's as much shoulder as you get
Your bones are truly a wonder to behold
Congrats
lmfao
should i be proud of having the best shoulders
``HUNKS UNITED``
from a photoshoot I did in 2012
Sleeves rolled up por favor gene
you judge bone angles?? damn
bitch i am cackling
"lithe slender muscle"
woah that's really detailed
Can I have a shirt on?
Send me a picture of your shoulders
have you even seen me with my shirt off
Hey alan
wow a thorough analysis
excuse me
that is
The god has spoken
Jane: 5/10 shoulders are proportionally rather large and rather square-shaped and your neck doesn't create a very sharp angle with the shoulder

Cindy: 6.5/10 while shapely, your clavicle-acromion joint protrudes upwards from your shoulder a bit more than I personally like 

Helen: 8/10 quite exceptional shoulder in my opinion due how it tapers off into the arm as well as an overall good general curvature

Salina: 8.5/10 while very similar in proportion and shape to Helen's shoulder, a slight edge is given for the vaguely smaller front to back width as well as a slightly better neck-shoulder connection appearance

Jiayi: 2/10 while the shape/height combo makes it very nice to rest my head upon, your shoulders are rather bony and do not have a nice, plump appearance that is inherent to the rest of this group minus me. Much of a shoulder's rating lives and dies by plumpness.

Noah: 7.5/10 during the time of freshman year, Noah was not overly muscular as I assume he is now. This meant that the lithe, slender muscle in his shoulders created an appealing shape, especially for his height. With that in mind, he loses points for the way his neck flows into the shoulder

Gene: :(

Alan: :(

Myself: 3/10 I actually believe myself to have quite unsightly shoulders because my upper shoulder is rather bony in addition to the fact that my upper arm does not have a good ratio with them, making them seem too large at times
<@!193229269076279298> agreed
i think i got lucky with my legs bc they have't actually atrophied that much appearance wise since the tkd days
Guy focus too much on upper body, girls too much on lower
Lmao thanks, Cindy
Girls and guys workout routines are reversed often
work it gene
I'm obviously a tad biased tho lol
I've skipped many a leg day, yet my legs can still look p amazing
Oh lol
skip leg day
How exactly do you neglect/not neglect a leg?
^
holy fuck he's jacked
girls know the value of the Leg
speaking of saint nicholas
see I think guys tend to neglect their legs
He probably thinks it's close enough
Well, he's seen Nicholas
how many bicycle sprinter legs do you think you'll see in real life
Secret twin
Lmao I was about to say "or at least they can be"
sigh
You obviously haven't seen Olympic bicycle sprinter legs <@503787499605458954>
can be
Male legs are still attractive though, mind you
I was going to say that if neck down was in play, calves would be my answer
male legs are objectively far less attractive thank you
now i know what i'm gonna do for the next text based art thing i make you
I'm just SAYING
well
`-LEGS holy jesus bless the female leg
`
Don't get all the fuss
that's like a lot oops
ok for me - for girls:
-collarbones
-LEGS holy jesus bless the female leg

guys:
-jawline
-forearms

both:
-back & abs
-cheekbones
Never noticed someone's eyes
Well, then my answer's gonna have to be eyes as well then
depends on the person
not really
as I said
eh
Aren't we all tho?
it's not even funny
i'm such a sucker for pretty eyes
Cuz everyone will say "eyes" or "hair"
I feel like eyes should be a bigger thing for me than they actually are
Yeah, that's the thing. If neck up is in play, none of the answers will be interesting
eyes is prob the winner tho
what is life
sigh
or noah when it comes to arms
or i need to join jarrett in the shoulder boat
My ibuprofen is gonna wear off any moment, yet I am still down for this lol
probably eyes
upon reflection
tbh
I'm honestly stuck between several things, and this is harder than it should be
man I meant to sleep like half an hour ago but y'all started talking about music and sex, 2 things I am literally always down to talk about
as long as it's consensual and you're not like permanently harming them
To answer your question tho
honestly I wouldn't judge that either
üëÄ
don't cut ppl thx
knifeplay
cough
^
Only overtly harmful ones
Not really
I feel like that's one of the fetishes that deserves judgement
no judgment if you are
I am indeed not
I hope you're not attracted to shit
I feel like it's not that hard to draw a line
I phrased that very weirdly
Ok, but then like isn't ass and shit technically non-sexual?
non genitalia
as in like
dick or not dick
basically
Just curious
What's sexual and what's non-sexual?
poll: what non-sexual body part do you find most attractive
I totally have a thing for collarbones
I don't have that much of a thing for shoulders
Mine are seen much more often
Acromion is what the end of the clavicle connects to
Collarbones can be aesthetically pleasing
top shoulder bones look nice
<@472541429130854421> boi, ya seen mine?
idk what acromion is
clavicle is collarbone
Use fucking English, mate
I have the worst shoulders
Yall are very blessed in the clavicle/acromion department
oh dear
Mb, carry on
Oh, did we?
we asked him to rate
I mean what else is he supposed to do
(assuming you're checking out our shoulders)
Not creepy at all
Im looking through all the photos I have of you guys
Man
Usually it's partway in at earliest. That thing was cursed from the get go.
ok idr what the actual muscle group is? deltoids maybe? but when those are filled out and you get like. deliciously muscular shoulders
I started hating myself for it before even starting to type it. That's a first lmao.
Alright, time to pack it up. That's the most cursed message coming out of this channel today, lmao.
*tips shoulder cap* "m'shoulder"
it's when your shoulders rock a fedora
I don't know what that means
capped shoulders are best shoulders imo
Bony anything is kinda yike tbh
I'm not very swole, so my shoulders/arms as a whole are kinda small for a guy. I'm simultaneously self-conscious about it and love it.
Sorry Jiayi
That's why bony shoulders are also not nice
Visual texture is important
LOL
Like nice dude your shoulder is a 90 degree angle block of wood
Like that aint a good feeling
really?? ok our preferences are p different then
ooh T
Stay away from my shoulders
Oh shit
They're rather off-putting
i could be wrong
or some of the other guys
Ah Gene I am not into super muscular shoulders
noah and cole
actually work out here and are remotely jacked are like
the only people who like
not offended either way though
lmao
If they work out a ton, they might be mildly offended
I think I'd be kinda relieved
Depends on the context
no
Is it rude for me to tell someone that I do not believe their shoulders to be attractive?
if that is deemed necessary
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Like
Should I add reasoning for my scores?
Ok, nice shoulders are really aesthetically pleasing, but I don't have anything near a kink for them
I think he's just more into shoulders than Salina is
i don't share, sorry
kinky
Jarrett's more into Noah than Salina is confirmed
noted
ok, gene doesn't have a shoulder kink
But also
No shit, Sherlock
i'd prob put noah at like 7-7.5 but i am fucking biased
They're shoulders. They're aesthetically pleasing, but they're not attractive. I'm putting them above average (5) because there's nothing wrong with them, and he's my friend, so might as well be nice.
if 5 is avg
are we saying 5 is avg or 7 is avg
I could give them a 6.5/10
lmfao
Cause that was a freshman year rating
Dunno if he's too jacked now though
I never got the greatest look at the dude's shoulders cuz I was mostly distracted by the fact that he was shirtless to begin with, thereby making me very uncomfortable
so fucking entertained rn
i am just
lmfao
Absolutely gorgeous
jk
;)
You seen that man's shoulders?
Hey what
damn
ok that's a bit high
8/10
wait how'd he rate noah's shoulders
LMAO
He can't bear to look at my face right now cuz it's swollen, so now he wants my shoulders
jk jk sorry
hell yeah he is ;)
lmfao
Jarrett is only interested in me for my body
rip
I am uncomfortable
Yes
Are you asking me for nudes?
lmfao
Gene is gonna have to toss me a shoulder pic then
rate the group?
since you gave noah's shoulders a randomly high rating
just out of curiosity
Shoulders maybe
are you *sure*
Hey I am decidedly not into incest
Jarrett's into incest
But like any decent human being, he wouldn't want to hurt his family
Thus, he's not into sadism
actually og
literally the chillest chinese teacher I've ever met
s/o to jiang laoshi
... do i want to know why it translates to yellow piece
You know, it's starting to add uo
Sorry Ms Jiang for asking that question last year
Also ÈªÑÁâá is generally the term for porn
i think sadism is fine
eh
don't fuck kids guys
Sadism is still pretty freaky
Most people's lists were p tame
only thing that freaks me out a lil is ageplay but if it's safe and consensual go for it I guess
yea
Everything on that list is pretty normal imo
It is to Jarrett
I don't think anything on that list is particularly wild actually
I don't think sadism is that weird
If it helps, there were some more entertaining lists that might've caused us to forget lol
oh right that was like 3rd on mine oops lmfao
Yeah, but we also did that BDSM test a while back
last time I said I could be
not necessarily
Someone's behind on the news
rip
cindy is def a sadist
this just in
scary world, being a shut-in
if you think about it, this is the extent of human interaction that most of these people get
lol
probably
honestly, if I was in the mood to freak someone out for no reason
that you've also been *cough* hitting on for the last few snack runs
but do you ask it to an internet stranger
jk jk
I have an abnormal # of conversations w yall about furries
*these are the degenerates i consort w*
Yeah 12 maybe
I'm 17
so they're just immature
ü§î
........
*hmmm*
they also didn't know what opt meant
they claim they are 17
this person had text chat which is for the teens
but like
(18+ and has paid money)
there's a good deal of ppl w open chat
You could be not the only non-kid playing a kids game, but the wording of that sentence makes me feel like this is really a twelve year old somewhere
rip my faith in humanity
i also got asked this on a kids game
welcome to facts i didn't need to know lol
I'm pretty sure shipin was not the word she used for video but that's what Google gave me so
Ë£∏‰ΩìËßÜÈ¢ë
It was this
what was the context that this came up in o.O
Press F to pay respects
I definitely can recognize it if I heard it again
Sad thing is I can't actually remember the word
(even tho we could just use Google lol)
S p i l l
what is it
I learned the Chinese word for porn today and it was from my mom of all people
***gasp***
I'm still right
actually no
*gasp*
I think I may have to actually revise my thoughts on sadism
Fair enough
unadulterated sadism is deriving pleasure/joy from inflicting pain on others regardless of consent
but sadism as a concept in kind of a different story imo
in a sexual context, yeah consent is heavily stressed
like in bdsm after-care is super emphasized because you don't want to fuck the other party too hard emotionally
Per my understanding, there's typically consent involved
so what are your thoughts on it
so Gene you can't just say `That's not how sadism works` and then not back it up
That's valid. I respect that.
but i don't feel like airing them to the world
i have my own share of thoughts on this
don't care
i honestly
eh
And judging by her reaction, for Salina in particular
This is just a very uncomfortable conversation as a whole
what is the point here?
Noah, I think you're missing the point here
wait so what do you think sadism is?
4. ....
1. That's not how sadism works.
2. They're right. That's rape.
3. Wtf Noah
.... yay
yay!
noah is considering rape
What the actual hell is going on
oh boi
...
the problem is if you know they do want it
you just have to know they don't want it
no they can be aware
the other person can't be aware
you can't ask her for her thoughts
<@!340319804747415553> thoughts
please don't commit a crime to find out what true sadism is like
lol
your point being?
that's also called rape and that is illegal
or at least you can't be aware of the fact they want it
for it to be true sadism I don't think the other person can want it
interesting convo guys
oh boy
pain is a state of mind
since pain is a subjective thing
seeing as if they want it you're not actually hurting them
well yea, but doesn't that mean it's not actually "sadism"
in any safe bdsm interpretation that's what it means
in your guys (?) interpretation sex sadism doesn't involve hurting the person when they don't want to be hurt, it only involves hurting them when they want to be hurt
see this is what separates sex sadism from actual sadism
ok I'm definitely a bit of a masochist, I think I *could* be into sadism
personally ill take the masochist side over the sadist 9/10 times
that's pretty fair actually
'cause you're trusting them to hurt you enough for you to feel it and like it but not enough to like. actually harm you
the pain part plays into it too though
but thats just consent i guess
submit and trust i can see
also, I can see how it'd be pretty damn hot to see someone submit to and trust you completely, even when you're hurting them, and loving that pain?? that might be a bit TMI but there's my take
tbh I think another big part is just the power trip like gene said
I guess I'll just leave it to them then
Hmmmm
3) find someone who you find sexy and is a masochist
2) ever heard of dom/sub
and just for completion's sake
4) big brain means big brain problems
1) I imagine that people with social disorders that can't empathize with others fall victim to sadism more often, especially those who have been the victim of violence, humiliation, or abuse
1 and 4
4) how did we, as a species, evolve to have sadism as an aspect of our culture
3) how to get into sadism
2) how sadism is an attractive trait
1) how people enjoy the pain of others
are you asking
"How the fuck are people into sadism"
that is a surprisingly pure sentiment
Feeling of power? Idk
Even if they want it
Like how can somebody just hurt someone like that
idk, cutting people up is also kinda "not safe for work"
he put it in nsfw so I assumed sex sadism
cause those are kinda different
actually first we need to clarify if he's talking about like sex sadism or just normal sadism
I don't really have an explanation for you
I think I could be into sadism, haven't really had the opportunity to test that out though lol
Maybe someone's into feeling guilty
do you want to fuck the person?
Felt *realllly* bad doing it
Someone told me to slap them to wake them up
is there a reason for the outburst
How the absolute ***fuck*** are people into sadism?
*today's 6/9/19 huehuehue sex lmao so funny*
(Also, having access to infinite lube is definitely a superpower. It's basically the power to defy friction whenever needed.)
How to start communist revolution provided that you have "enough" lube (infinite supply until it's deemed "enough"):
-Spread propaganda offering free lube to anyone who joins
-Lube everyone up so well until bullets start sliding past their body
-Stage an assault on target government
-Inevitably win since it's impossible to get shot due to excessive lube
-Threaten to over-lube anyone who dissents: literally put so much lube on their body that they will slip wherever they go and fall over
-Use the power from this to collectivize the economy and redistribute wealth
-Export lube from your supply to offset the inevitable transition recession
-Use lube to speed up machinery, enabling you to farm potatoes faster
Buy it
Absolutely iconic
It did get spilled on his crotch, so maybe that's it
Why is tea going in #nsfw
a link to one of the standards described by the committee
http://www.std.gov.cn/gb/search/gbDetailed?id=71F772D80523D3A7E05397BE0A0AB82A
aka those who SHOULD'VE been the ones to define the standard
a link to the National Tea Standardization Technical Committee of China
http://www.std.gov.cn/search/orgDetailView?tcCode=TC339
An actual copy of 3103
http://www.mus-ic.co.uk/images/blog/2006-04-27/bs_6008.pdf
ISO 3103 was defined by a British authority
sources to back up what I said
that's it
yeah
actually
I will also stand by my stance that Britain likes stealing things from other countries
I stand by the idea that China should be the one to decide what is a "international standard" in the realm of tea
Britain thinks it has the authority to define what is an "international standard of tea" even though they weren't the ones who originally had it
I'll revise my opinion thusly:
reviewed it just now to make sure
I've seen it before
Then come and apologize to us all for how wrong you were
Now go watch it again
You actually managed to get the exactly the wrong idea from it
<@478706068223164416> you are stupid and missed the point of the video
Is just the plot too much?
"Way too much"
so my takeaways:
-jarrett knows way too much about hentai story arcs
-we now have incest porn in this channel
-alan have the ability to talk about tea regardless of the context
/rant
Britain is a few hundred years late to the tea compared to China, if you want a "standard" cup of tea, you're better off asking the nation that it really came from
And just like everything Britain does, they stole it from another country and proclaimed that their way was the best way to do it
I'm quite familiar with the standards of British tea
Wow y‚Äôall need Jesus
... wtf
no?
wait, you don't love and look up to your family members?
we have Noah who's in love with his older brother
and Jarrett who watches hentai about siblings who fuck
ok so
........
So far this life I have comitted no major sins
he is both
yes
christian
Pure
Can't exorcise a pure Christian
Sike
https://tenor.com/view/jaiden-animations-demon-exorcism-exorcist-cross-gif-13466324
send jarrett back to wherever we summoned him from
hence his vast knowledge on the deep lore of the story world
if you can't tell, I asked Jarrett to find me a clip
Then they all bang in episode 2
wait what
Other sister walks in
They do their thing
*is this your vibrator???*
Does a little magic trick
Guy walks in
Shit ass plot too
Yes that is incest you are seeing
That clip is from the hentai Imoutou paradise which in Japanese means little sister paradise
I didn't know that
interesting
really?
Fun fact
But anyways
If you dunk from the 3 point line after being fouled you can get 4 points
we have a music channel you know
in this channel?
you guys wanna listen to my favorite song rn
I think it's honestly p wack, but if no one's getting hurt, whatever I guess
Hentai is not my thing
Yuk.
i saw what Noah sent
I think she did just see it
How can you hate without first seeing it?
i'm not scarred
i've just never seen hentai before and i hate it
you're welcome
How considerate.
I put time and effort into it so you wouldn't have to download the audio or video
I went through several audio formats to find one that worked
Well, Jane seems scarred for life
and yeah you don't have to download it
Oh lmao
oh
well that's one way people do exposure therapy
discord has a built in player for both
?
although some people suggest throwing yourself into the deep end first is the best way to adapt
I mainly just don't wanna download it on my phone tbh
yea that does make sense
if you wont listen to it then don't watch it
don't
And I haven't even watched the clip yet
Honestly, I'd prefer the situation where I'm not getting railed in the ass by Noah while wearing a horse head
i think this is worse than railing <@!258094439636008971> in the ass while wearing horse heads
see the spreadsheets
I imagine he's done worse tbh
yea I do like taking on weird projects when I'm bored
i feel like i've seen what Noah does when he's lonely and I don't like it
please don't
unless someone wants to offer a competing clip and then we can have a vote
for our group it is now
I mean, not really. It's standard
so that's still pretty good
Yike
yea but the most you can get is 3
Slam dunks are only worth 2 points still
NOAH
oh GEEZ
<@!472541429130854421>
yike
8/10?
noah's a slam dunk
jarrett's rating, not mine
<@173668455856340994> what do you have to say about this?
not a chance
with those 8/10 shoulders?
i dunno man
i could see noah getting rejected by jarrett
give up gene
"pretty desperate. i have jarrett on my list first."
"hey noah how desperate would you have to be to hook up with gene?"
mine
nope
He mine now
boyfriend
Not anymore ya don't
math slave
who's multipurpose i guess
i just have noah
no i don't
...?
Salina's got a lot of toys hm
noah's mine
nah
I wonder what sort of school voice actresses go to to learn this
<@193229269076279298> if you're ever jealous, you're always welcome in my room ;)
..... oh boi
we'll have fun üòâ
idk
good question noah
well guess rooming with you will be interesting
<@!340319804747415553> handle or rake end?
damn jane
Either, any sort of visual helps
<@!340319804747415553> gladly
slowly with a rake
I was kinda thinking about doing it during lunch, but everyone is kinda dying, so I'm kinda scared that's not the greatest idea
fuck me
<@!472541429130854421> so do you want like the whole episode or just the video that goes with the audio bit?
ME TOO
W H Y
WHY
2+ pages
why is it
as i do this tok writeup
slowly hating life
i am
rip
the time is past
nvm
y'know what
the french thing that salina said
https://youtu.be/6tMoE8siNo8?t=224
it's <@!193229269076279298> and <@!340319804747415553>
I only exported it as audio
I need to compile the video though
<@!472541429130854421> uh sure
<@478706068223164416>
you if want an understanding of standards watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAsrsMPftOI
:(
i dont
i love you Helen
ü§î ü§î ü§î
dear god
lMAO
*NO*
oh god helen
Can you send the video instead
see this is a common misunderstanding of standards
you don't have to download it
I would very much not like to download an mp3 with moaning thank you very much
that's not sexy at all
idk what that means
oh that's gross
je'bate se quois
je'bated
bated
this is the clip you must try and recreate for your official rating
but here it is the standard audio clip
I know everyone has been waiting with bated breath on this
What part of my answer is confusing
It's almost as if Discord gives you notifications when we're talking, allowing you to join our conversations
when i left last night you guys were talking, and when i'm back today you're also talking
could you actually expand on your answer
yea
Is there other things you want explained <@193229269076279298>
Yours tend to be very weird
Particularly yours
some are weirder than others
we all have weird thoughts sometimes
hey that was the first thing that popped into my head
I can tell you right now it's not horse heads and Ram Ranch for me
`you can have passionate sex without being animalistic`
exactly, passionate all depends on what the people involved like and find brings them closer
G'night
aight night yall
...idk what else there is to say on that
you can have passionate sex without being animalistic
you can have rough sex without being animalistic
solid
yes
does that mean it's 3 to 1 right now?
I'm probably gonna sleep in like 10 mins
didn't jane say she was gonna sleep like half an hour ago
I went to do other things and was kinda amazed that this convo was still going when I came back
Also omg you're still here
I mean, I agree with him as well
and all of his descriptions for different descriptors + sex
tbh I agree with noah
``just kinda short`` I'm sure people are used to that by now when something has to do with you and sex
and not really backed up by why
just kinda short
I guess
`I just think of animal sex as very passionate sex`
Also, she kinda already did
All three expressions of interests were ironic
<@!520095106888630348> you ever gonna explain your view?
that's unexpected
huh
I express interest in all three at different times depending on my current mood
Yeah
really?
But what I said before holds true: if we played fuck, marry, kill, I could still put Noah in any of the three categories
and it's not really a but
i just don't see it the same way as you
hah noted
Not that that's not settled, I would just like to clarify that I would not like to have animal sex with Noah
I feel like there is a but there
i get what you're saying and that's definitely valid
I just lack any further comments
Yeah, I do
do you get what I'm saying?
"I just think of animal sex as very passionate sex"
"animal sex" to my implies rough, hard, fast, self serving, shallow, etc 
basically animal like sex
"passionate sex" could be either slow or fast, hard or soft, ect, it depends on the people
rough sex is rough, it's in the word
so that's why I brought up "rough sex" in relation to "animal sex"
I feel like they have overlap, but also have people treat them like the same thing when they're not
Gee, I wonder why
Merriam-Webster doesn't have an "animal sex" definition
the problem here is we're playing with a word that has no hard definition
some people are fine with a one night stand
So not Noah?
maybe it only happens for some people who need emotional attachment
other than that
i dunno
I just think of animal sex as very passionate sex
I think you've overanalyzed this
<@!520095106888630348> <@!258094439636008971>
Pass
anyone else want to give their thoughts on it
not "rough sex"
but we're talking about "animal sex"
if you said "rough sex" that's a different thing in my mind
so animal sex is basically "you trying to get your fix"
Based on Noah's description, it sounds pretty one-sided
yes, but animals want to get themselves off, they don't care/aren't even aware of the other side getting off
don't couples want to get each other off tho
Thank you, Noah! Very cool!
basically based on the UD definition and the implied definition
"animal sex" is humans having rough carnival pleasure sex, like animals
it's not something you're sharing necessarily, its more each party just trying to get off
you could do that with a one night stand just as well as in a committed relationship
so I feel that kinda defeats the "couples" part
And anime girl moans
Literally porn
what was last night's convo
Tbf, this is somehow less uncomfortable than last night's conversation, so sure
unsure
What is even happening right now
no shit
what do you think I'm about to do
No
Discuss the extent to which animal sex is useful in the satisfaction of both parties in a relationship
no I'm saying animal sex feels like it kinda can defeat the purpose of the "couples" part
I will not discuss
No
can i interest you in an IB command prompt
Also, in theory, shouldn't the Minotaur be considered a reverse centaur?
that's for you and <@!258094439636008971> to discuss
ok man
i'm not a relationship counselor
I feel like that can kinda defeat the purpose
you don't want animal sex?
ok now that I understand the statement, I must personally disagree
oh dear god
human body and horse head
and just think of it as a reverse centaur
i did not agree to this
lucky couple
animal sex
really fucking weird sex
that's just sex
that's not masturbation
masturbating only ok if it's noah and gene with horse heads
jkjk g'night
noooo stay and talk about incest/masturbation/clone sex with us
night
i gotta go to slep
yike
if using something completely sci-fi, it depends
wait is it 1
if using somatic cell nuclear transfer, then yes
i mean
you have virus dna
and even nonliving ones
are they a part of your family if they're newly formed
you share dna with a lot of living creatures
then sex with anything would be incest
define incest
so it's still incest
but you still have the same dna
though I guess cloning isn't actually too far off from where we are now w science
I feel like the sci-fi part kinda cancels out the familial bond of having the same dna
well, the clone didn't pop out of the same uterus as you did
or almost
i think that's literally narcissus
"if you have sex with your clone, is it considered masturbation?"
this is the first time i've heard about it
yeah
do they talk about that
people always talk about having sex with a clone, and i just feel like that'd be weird cuz it'd be the same thing as trying to have sex with your identical twin
and he'd probably try to have sex with his twin
valid. he is one of a kind.
being noah's twin is 100% unacceptable
i can accept being your twin
are you sure about that?
im not noah
mmhm sure
i don't have a cousin named jack
does he live in alabama?
the first thing that came to mind when you asked that was "my cousin"
so who exactly is jack?
keep up with the lingo, old man
lmao
`most couples want animal sex`
Wanna explain this a bit more?
wait what
me out of my desire to kill noah or noah out of his desire to satisfy his necrophilia kink
i'm not sure who'd kill who first
all i'm saying is that you two are a lucky couple
also, this is peer pressure
i dont think this counts
most couples want animal sex
listen
it's entertaining when you're not the one noah is talking about ass-fucking with a horse head mask on to the tune of ram ranch
i feel like it'd make a romeo and juliet situation with noah and salina
and what?
No this is entertaining
what if we just booted noah from the discord server
but you decided to be the one to do it
correct
^
no it was his idea
this was your idea
maybe we don't ask noah questions anymore
uh
dear god
well this is where that last thought came from at least

glad you asked now
`is this like

"masturbating furiously to the thought of railing Gene in the ass while we both wear horse head masks and Ram Ranch plays in the background"
was my first thought
i jumped back via pins

noah
my brain is like "quick, what's the most ridiculous possible response"
why were you scrolling that far back? that was a while ago?
do i want to know what popped up
am I the only one that has really weird things pop into their head when someone asks questions like that
what yall do at night
is this like
I do it so much
lol
i never noticed noah spell incorrectly until the day he got his wisdom teeth out. then i couldn't unsee it
might as well make them at least the same
I'm like it looks kinda right
well no shit
it's even better cuz he made the same typo twice
lmao
do they include images
what kind of imagines
images I don't need
this has spawned images in my mind
i do weird shit with my kazoos
i don't
cuz sasha uses his kazoo tastefully
idk
i don't think it was sasha
sasha is the og kazoo master
i passed someone on the stairs and they blew their kazoo it felt like directly into my ear
is that the thing with the kazoos
not mine, but i happened to have my own that day
oh
someone bought a pack of 50 and distributed in one of the band classes apparently
no one did it on the bus though god bless
and it actually got so annoying
ok a bunch of people bought kazoos at silverwood
<@!520095106888630348> basically i trust you again but don't stab me again
what
however, i will give it a 4 if i have access to a kazoo
also, if we're using that video for reference, the answer is still 0 lmao
oh lol
<@!472541429130854421> ding dong your opinion is wrong
we turned 4 months into 4 minutes
Hot dogs are not sandwiches
right?
wait hold up you guys don't have the same bday
you gotta trust that
being told by future you to avoid dumb shit
which is like
which makes her a better version of me by 4 minutes
but she is the older twin
some mild reservations about trusting jane tho, cuz she affirmed with me that we were twins in TOK today, and i don't trust myself, so idk where that puts her
ok, i just watched it. i trust all of you except noah again.
lmao tea
<@!520095106888630348> unlike trying to murder my ass with something i gave you
also, it's ironic and funny that cindy wins, so there's kinda that. helen's thing isn't that atrocious
<@!472541429130854421> yeah fam, but you shot down grad cap decorating, so cindy wins based on the past 24 hours
I'm annoyed @ me
I WAS HOLDING MY WALLET
<@!503787499605458954> you were open about it and it was an honest mistake, and i said no rush, so i eh
I LITERALLY HAD THE MONEY ON ME
I actually paid you back in a timely manner tho
weak
yeah, he gave like a 3 or 4
he rated himself a 3
yeah
give a number
did _Noah_
wait
I am dumb
yeah, i didn't, helen
I forgot to pay you back again tho
O:
<@!503787499605458954> you haven't tried to stab me with something i just gave you (jane), asked me what my moans are like (noah), or canceled an idea that you planned (helen) in the past 24 hours, so you win
Wow you didn't trust me earlier? I'm hurt üò≠
Helen also said that you could listen to it
<@!258094439636008971> _listen_
see she gets it
i mean, it's a well deserved one
^
of all the people to trust
also probably misplaced
it's an honor
woah you do?
<@!258094439636008971> I still want your real score
i kinda wanna check it now cuz i actually trust cindy
oh hahaha
I listened
what do
jane i love u
at least in cartoons
you just throw overripe fruit
you throw tomatoes at bad performances
that's just like the thing you do
Why tomatoes?
<@!193229269076279298> if we're doing that, can we also throw tomatoes at the loser?
I think I would enjoy that
we'd all need those score cards they have in movies though
that sounds really fucking weird out of context
I kinda want to watch Jiayi and Emily have a moan off
surprisingly, i don't either
also true
I don't doubt him
<@!193229269076279298> there's your new record
lmao
dear god
10
fam, i already gave a rating
but it is reasonable
i don't like this reasoning
ok well if you're going to be dramatic, you may as well give your best performance as an anime girl
the wound is still healing
you shanked me
i _poked_ you
you asked me to give you my pen earlier today and stabbed me with it
You can trust her
i like dogs
how much can i really trust you?
just listen to it
you see, when i said i didn't wanna look for reference, i mean i don't actually want it playing through my computer
i'm laughing so hard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bbsfGsrqhs
lol
so i'm giving myself a 0
i don't know what the goal is and don't really wanna go looking for reference
same
I wanna hear Gene do it
i said 0
or 8
didn't she say 9
well <@!460689096646590465> currently has our top self ranked score
<@!193229269076279298> ok i don't actually know but i'm a little afraid that it would be pretty accurate if i tried
idk whose, but it's somebody's
it's somebody's fetish
like some girls really like low voices
no just
being turned on by high voices
care to give a number
also <@!520095106888630348> seeing as you're here
I just thought it was too ridiculous to be what you were saying
oh so yea I was right
moaning so high that someone moans?
I dunno, are anime girls turned on by high voices
I don't get the `"is that a lesbian porn thing"`
no I get that
i did not understand
and Emily said her voice wasn't high enough
I thought you were asking for their ability to make anime girls moan
i mean, i get what's happening
no the `"is that a lesbian porn thing"`
it was a misunderstanding
nvm
i didn't either
I don't get it
?
yeah i saw emi say her voice wasn't high enough and i was like "is that a lesbian porn thing"
that took me like 5 reading to understand what you were saying
yike, that's even worse
at first i thought he was asking about ability to make anime girls moan, not moan like one
i'm questioning why he's such a degenerate
what?
why is this happening
which is what im getting at
well, we have classes in a wider variety of subjects
you missed the point though `variety of things` 
just having more of something doesn't make it different, it's still the same thing; just a lot of it
i giving academics three points solely by virtue of us having more classes at once:
-academics
-academics
-academics
-social
-music
-chill stuff (video games, youtube, reddit, poll party, etc.)
-umpiring
-random shit i do for CAS here and there
-watching the mariners die
-skyline clubs
-questioning your weird shit
idk, I don't take it
<@!258094439636008971> how would you divide IB then?
my list would be
-academic (differential equations) 
-exercise (lifting at the Y)
-Engineering (aluminum monocoque and suspension research)
-working with my hands (Salina's math project)
-social (this)
-relaxing (video games and youtube)
-fixing myself (therapy, physical therapy, and massage)
-weird shit (anime girl moan friend ranking)
but i dont think it's just one thing
i don't think the fact that it's one thing is the problem
eh i mean
so I'd count it all under one "thing"
eh that's like all academic stuff
it is very much not fun
i mean, IB diploma has a large variety of things for me to occupy my time with
because life is more fun when you have a variety of things to occupy your time with
why the hell is noah so invested in this lmao
For fun maybe I'll record some lines by Lucy from Fairy Tail
I'd be better at voice covering some anime girl's lines tho
Same
I‚Äôll try to imitate if I get an example.
*still judging*
._.
stop judging me and start helping me look
wtf
also I'll need help finding a 5 - 10 second clip that has a good range or vocals
<@!173668455856340994> 
<@!472541429130854421> 
<@!503787499605458954> 
<@!340319804747415553>
who's down to be recorded
so basically you're saying "exploit me while I'm drunk"
there is no way in hell i will record myself moaning while sober
if you get me drunk enough i will
to make it slightly less subjective
I feel like we need an audio clip for people to try to recreate
but I feel like just saying "moan like an anime girl" is gonna be too subjective
pass
also now I want to compile sound clips of everyone doing their best attempt
0 - 10
now give me your number
<@!105508293522264064> I'm glad this is what you come back for
anyway
he could be hearing them soon
you don't know what he beats his meat too
i‚Äôm glad you won‚Äôt be hearing that any time soon
well then
its like unpleasant to listen to
since i cant stand that shit
is it just me or is anime girl moans a giant turn off
<@561219716429905920> I know you're here
my voice doesn‚Äôt go high enough to be a 9
Hmm, small asian girl, yea that would make sense
8
0 is bad, 10 is good
Of course
also what does a 0 and a 10 constitute
am i still allowed to join
0 - 10
`Please rate your ability to make anime girl moans`
What list?
cough up
@everyone I want more numbers for my list
....
;)
*b i t c h*
To make a comment or to not make a comment, these are the hard decisions that define us
6 or 7ish
Based on context I would say like
But um
I‚Äôm afraid to open it at home too
Lol
Yeah don't open it at school lol
I‚Äôm afraid to open it
Scroll up for the link
What counts as an anime girl moan anyway
Wtf
.....
Please rate your ability to make anime girl moans
I feel like you have to answer the question
Wtf did I just read
Well
ill give him credit for that
idk if he's better or not, but he certainly has less shame
you've been here since the start though
hopefully each version is better than the last
I've been a very different person every year of high school
Noah really changed after he left skyline
*is
sophomore noah was a bitch
mother fucking Ansen
always wrong
oh dear god i remember this
I think it was during the "art" argument
He said those exact words to me in sophomore year
yea
Prostitution isnt illegal if you film it
... you did?
why does filming it make it any better exactly?
I made this point back in LA/SS sophomore year
it's just some countries make it weird
the US has the weird case where you can't hire a prostitute but you can hire a porn star
no, no it doesn't have to
porn is always gonna have really questionable laws around it
and the interpretation
Japan are you stating to see the problem with this wording
so what exactly is the problem here
and it's "not indecent"
I mean it's not violent
oh so with the censoring it doesn't count as indecent, so we can show it to kids right
<@!472541429130854421> lmao
Porn is meant to be a solo activity in all respects, including conversation on it apparently
this is a very long one-sided conversation about porn
so if they released an uncensored version in the US, Japanese viewers would still be able to watch it
because the internet doesn't have borders, but what you can film where does
it just seems like a really weird system
idk
maybe they're just not allowed to profit in any way off of the uncensored material
is that illegal?
what if they contract and American to do the editing and he then releases an uncensored version for American and wires them the money made
is it just straight up illegal to let the uncensored version of the film out of the company in any way?
or does the Japanese government still have a problem with that?
like if they created an American LLC could they release it uncensored?
what are we talking about?
I have to wonder how it works
But its extremely popular despite that
Well yeah
Japanese censoring laws
Not really sure what youre getting at
like are you even trying, or are we just all pretending this makes it totally ok
because Japan is weird
<@!173668455856340994> well it is if it's made in Japan
yike
Behold the power of yellow fever
wait that's kinda surprising then
oh
hentai is hentai
Japanese would mean ethnicity of the person
basically the title "teen" just means the person could pass as a teen... a Hollywood teen... a really questionable Hollywood teen
so the joke is they go from "teen" 18-25, straight to "MILF" 25+
just hentai or
what does "japanese" porn mean
MILF is apparently 25
"many actresses have started making this type of pornographic film at age 25"
You know I'm surprised that japanese is number 1 and 3 when its all censored
that's why
^
also porn age titles are an interesting thing
But why would they search specifically for teen porn then
I note that there is no teen male category
18 and 19 are a thing
Men like Teen porn
This corroborates the unfortunate fact that humans are naturally pedophiles and find younger females attractive
the system is smarter than that
a view it's just a 5 second watch
Hmm
youtube figured this out a long time ago
no
lol
Yes
are you trying to say that accidental viewing makes up a large percentage of the views?
I cant be the only person who has read/seen gay Porn accidentally
Aight Noah
Japan is really killing it
yes, I'm confused what you're getting at though
I'm fascinated by pornhub insighta
Accidentally or otherwise
Have you ever seen any type of gay porn?
I'm confused what you're trying to say
<@!173668455856340994>?
pornhub's year in review are always an interesting read
https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2018-year-in-review
Noah have you not seen gay porn in any medium?
But yaoi manga is I think a big market
you know they're trying to make money
that's like complaining about the lack/low quality of female porn
no shit, it has the smallest audience
*concern*
The yaoi stuff is the lowest quality of them all
That being said
Clearly you havent seen enough hentai gene
dear god
cervix bruising here we come
Ahhhhhhhh I hate this image
All the way into the uterus
everyone you're welcome for that imagery
so basically face down ass up with me railing you
<@!193229269076279298> idk, i think i'd need some setup to get into character üòâ
really get into character
<@!258094439636008971> practice some more and then come back
we were all there for karaoke
he can hit those high notes
exactly
I imagine he'd be pretty good
Gene has a good vocal range
<@!258094439636008971> put some effort in man
yea, so I guess people can act up or down as necessary
0/10
Yes
it's Naruto voiced by a girl?
<@!258094439636008971> you're here, give me your answer
Some male voices are good at imitating anime girls
<@!472541429130854421> got a least a 4
no I'm more disappointed it what I would guess it your lack of effort
she's right
and you don't have a particularly deep voice
I just don't sound like that sorry
you're disappointed in my lack of ability to make hentai moans
<@!503787499605458954> if you make a comment about me not having a deep voice, idk I'll insult you or something
what the shit kind of degeneracy is going on in my christian discord server?
<@!503787499605458954> I'm dissapointed, me and Jarrett have the excuse of being guys and having deeper voices, you don't
I avoid everything scat
ah
Negative
One word
Like
Dogshit
is that "dog shit hentai" or "dog, shit hentai"? cause those are very different
imo like 50% of it just comes from having a female voice
2
I really have seen some dog shit hentai
as we get more
will update
Noah: 3/10
Jarret : 3/10
Helen: 4/10
Cindy: 2/10
Salina: 7/10
Emily: 8/10
Jiayi: 10/10
like how slideshow and headset mic can we get
I'll give myself a four
lowest quality hentai ever produced by a professional studio?
which now gives me another question
that is also fair
Not gonna lie it could be a 5-6 depending on the quality of the hentai that we're talking about
Fair enough
give yourself a 2 or 3 then
eh that works
Unless you want some ahegao voice cracks
ok that's fair
My voice really cant go high anymore
really?
1
Um
"I don't want to go on xvideos that shit's fucking gay" the conviction in his tone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MspwEKdt_ko
also them taking it down spawned one of my all time favorite videos
click any video
https://hentaihaven.org/
What channel are we in?
are you asking me to post hentai in the chat?
I need some sort of reference
<@!173668455856340994> <@!233062637922025472> I need you two right now
well try it and return back with your score
I have never tried it and cannot rate myself
need to work on it
I rate myself 3/10
second question, rate your ability to make anime girl moans 0 - 10
question, have you ever done helicopter dick?
Damn come thru queen
<@258094439636008971> <@340319804747415553>
that didn't feel that much longer than the shortened one tbh. maybe i did take the full one last time. idk hto
update: mostly the same as before
i'll do it now cuz im bored
i didn't have as much time
did yall not do the extended version the first time? smh
we could also kill time by all taking the extended version
<@!173668455856340994>
Hmm
cuz the rest of us all have
did we ever make jarrett take the kink test?
so scandalous
what about nudes of my face
despite the fact that noah has tried before in the past
i do not need to ever see any of y'all nude
no thanks
just send your whole body
you're right
Ugh I‚Äôm not sending nudes of my knees lol
the alternative is we can all post pictures of our knees like we were suggesting yesterday
Rip
not saying we should make it one
i mean, that could be its own channel
what you don't want to turn this into the "Weird Porn Noah Has Found Browsing Reddit" channel?
but is it shit for the sake of posting shit or a thematic thing worth having a conversation around?
oh I got more shit I can dig up
there are def ways to tho
im not sure how you do
Question of who‚Äôs willing to top
Well
<@!193229269076279298> if you have any degenerate ideas to bring to the table, now would be the time to do so
is there anyway we can top last night's conversation?
so
gotcha
^this is why <@478706068223164416>
But are you a slut for them
I love cheezits too
why's this <#503796012285165568>
Apparently I'm a bitch for Cheez-Its as well cuz I just chugged a whole bag
So y'all know how Noah mentioned the Cheez-Its?
but of course neither of you are gonna respond cuz ya both are bad at that
although i know neither of you two are gonna sleep for another four hours cuz y'all are night owls
g'night
Bye
night yall
should not have sat around discussing dick/ass tattoos
I need to be up in like 6 hours
hey, i'm trying here
welp
No shit.
there's a joke to be made there
but not in reference to dicks... sadly
Ya left yourself wide open.
Salina also opened with a joke about my name
``prnis``
as the wise katya once said
what a queen
we stan an icon
iconic
LMAO
that was Katya's first ever message to me on discord
this is a shit diversionary tactic
Dye the bush green.
to get an extensive dick tattoo you need extensive dick
people might not even notice it's a micropenis cuz they're distracted by the tattoo
Baby carrot.
if you had a micropenis but got an extensive dick tattoo
well actually
actually yeah I agree
d r a g o n s w o r d  s u r p r i s e
better than a micropenis surprise
surprise her on your honeymoon w a dick tattoo
noah definitely does not seem like the guy to get a dick tattoo
I just remembered how appropriate it was in context
no we've done it before in this group
actually
you are far from the first person to interpret my name as a dick reference
i feel like salina might have some reservations about that idea
Yike
lmao
noah dragonsword needs to dragon his sword, noah, it's your destiny, get a dick tattoo
just had a thought that has me in stitches even if it's totally unoriginal
this is why you need the hyphen
i read cheetos first too
oh
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524132913219108876/581194272854769866/unknown.png
which makes a bit more sense even if
cheezit facial
I read cheetos at first
how do you eat cheez-its sluttily
I did not
i understood that reference
Ew
sorry sluttily eating cheezits makes typing hard
^
lmao that was so aggressive pre-edit
Ikr.
great show btw
Or maybe that was ears.
which one?
oh god I
That one panty and stocking episode.
it's somebody's kink for sure
well that's horrific
but yes you can
and it's a bad idea
the answer is yes
i mean, good luck actually fitting something up there
Would it be like tattooing the inside of your nose.
tbh noah I feel like the correct answer might be me, even though I've already said i wouldn't get an asshole tat
?
Mucus membrane.
It‚Äôs not outside skin.
more dense with nerves
one is like
ok but like
you could probably have one around the area?
dick and clit are the same cells
Like reeeeally painful.
Um
Probs painful too.
^
I don‚Äôt think it would work on the skin type.
just had that thought
def not jarrett
are clit tattoos a thing?
wait
I wanna say jarrett but I feel like that's mean
fredboat
who is mostly likely to get an asshole tattoo in this group?
wait you never answered where on your body you'd get tattooed
hmm
nsfw will never truly stay nsfw
we went from asshole tats to jsa in like 10 minutes
i relate
he's been to like 3 meetings
gabe doesn't actually come to stuff
no
lol
gabe
hm
it was a guy
not lia
sounds like something lianna would say
and it's accurate
I know
It‚Äôs a pretty common thing to say.
no it was at JSA
whomst've
damn I can't remember whomst then
idk who you're talking to, but if it's me, no
I don't really do one liners
nope
are you the one who came up to me to  be like "the bigger the hoop the bigger the hoe" that one time
lol
Ya just gotta be careful not to look like a b list pirate.
again, i feel like i have
<@!258094439636008971> she means like hula hoop sized ones
cool
no, yeah, i feel like i've seen this before.
and even them I'm very meh on earrings
actual hoops not like lil ring thingies
i feel like i have, but i couldnt tell you who or when
yea I don't like piercings I think they look bad, earings are the exception
and I feel like they'd actually look really good
yknow I've never seen a guy wear hoops
Bling.
oooooooh
also, i'll consider that offer for the future
true that
see I love how earrings, nose rings, even belly piercings sometimes look but fake ones look just as good so
tattoo yes, piercing no (more for safety reasons, same reason I will probably never wear a metal ring)
I have a lot of em if you ever wanna borrow
For you gene. Clip ons.
basic is valid
tattoo no piercing no
sorry, i'm basic
opposite, I want a bunch of tattoos, idk if I'm ever gonna get a real piercing tho
smart actually
Tats no. Piercing cartilage ears.
I know but I don't wanna tag people who are online but not actively participating
and cindy you can just do @ here
what if you need to shit while getting an asshole tattoo?
@ everyone here:
-would you get a tattoo and if yes where
-would you get a piercing and if yes where
true that i guess
But hell if it isn‚Äôt a move.
also, i'm in agreeance with everyone else that an asshole tat is not the move
what the hell
like "oh yea most people get their elementary school PE teacher tattooed on their assholes"
Painful. Difficult to remove.
but like I wouldn't know
more power to those who would and do
I wouldn't tattoo my asshole, to answer the earlier question
is there a standard for this I'm unaware of
idk man
like "why X", well what did you expect
thanks bethany
just "i had something private/inappropriate/personal, so i'm gonna put like a blank space or something in my clipboard"
EXACTLY
what would you get?
I feel like that almost makes it worse
She gotta beak for an asshole.
yeah why an octopus
in quality or in some other way?
sometimes
the dick was definitely worse
random off topic other question, do other people religiously clear their clipboards?
Out of all things an octopus
I don't need to be looking up something boom "oh yea that was that last thing I had copied"
go for it
also, idc either way, but i don't wanna be the only person greenlighting things
can I get an answer, so I can clear my clipboard
i think piercings anywhere near any sexual organ is just gonna be scary and painful to look at in general
I'm trying my best to not kill anyone's eyes today with them wanting them seared
is that a go ahead on the comparison photo?
labia/clit piercings freak me the fuck out
on the female side
Yessir i would like my dick stabbed many times with a needle
should I post a photo for comparison?
but it's a low bar
less horrific
i mean, that sounds
also people that get asshole tattoos, like really?
very much yike
now that must have been painful to get
yike
i mean, you gave us warning beforehand just now, so i'm ok with it
that ok?
<@!173668455856340994> stop
I'm gonna say because you all had to click past the +18 thing I can just post straight photos
i think they are by definition interesting. it just depends on what you mean.
<@258094439636008971> A tattoo of Richard Nixon
Body mods on intimate bits are interesting.
not that this is particularly better
something very different in mind
i had
ohhh
like specifically the dragon ones
what
ok have you guys seen dick tattoos?
one, look how big I am
two, look how hard you got me
three, look at me forcing a picture of my dick on you I'm now gonna go jack it to your disgusted reaction
i trust you, but i'm now confused
trust me when I say yes
does anyone *reeeaaally* like how a dick looks tho?
I am not one of them
it's more one of three things
some people like how they look
yeah
I don't think the point is the dick is necessarily attractive
gonna go out on a limb here, but i don't think the dick itself is attractive to anyone
I already don't find dicks particularly attractive? and if it's basically unusable then what's the point
for the answer to do you measure it hard or flaccid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmbXJ7LGCSo
oh hear is the video
on that
I would probably pass
thank you, cindy
anyways
you did indeed
smh I was just responding to gene
I said *visual*
lmao
I have regrets.
I got what I expected
lol what did you expect
not that I care, I'm alone in my room
I clicked, immediate pics
``visual learners`` that's one damn risky click
oh I have a video for that question
for the visual learners among us
https://www.reddit.com/r/MicroPenis/
i hate to be the one to ask this, but flaccid or erect
i've seen a little bit of variation. 3.25 or 3.66 also both show up
That thread said 1 and a quarter
I was thinking like sub 1"
damn reddit's sub really gives a very different expectation
around there
wait really?
apparently a micropenis is defined as 3.5 in or less
ah
also, i googled it
thoughts on dem fun sized dicks
oh yeah, micropenises
I guess you could have the guy wear a strap on?
i dont even remember lol
what was the original question
penetration can feel good regardless of whether you think guys are attractive or not
Butch.
Lesbians can like dick but not guys
good point
you could just like the guy aesthetic
doesn't mean you have to like it though
is the thing
see if you're getting into a relationship w a guy you expect dick
but they're kinda a *package* generally
I mean you could just like guys but not like dick
I think it's implied if you're straight and a girl you like dick
but they may not like dick
fair point
I will say that lesbians get it done with literally 0 inches of dick
which reminded me of this great thread
because based on the reaction to in the AITA thread, I assume they think you should treat micropenises the same way you treat waiting until marriage
https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ahd1ug/should_i_f23_tell_him_m29_that_im_waiting_until/
lmao
Funsized.
depends. at what point is it a micropenis?
thoughts on micropenises?
do tell
sparking a question
I mean u/heythere360 could love ass, but that's not what the flair means in this case
also the sub is "Am I the Asshole" hence the name flairs
lmaooooo
oh, actually, this is vaguely familiar now
the whole first comment chain is just great
found it
https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/anyom1/aita_newlywed_husband_32m_wanted_to_wait_til/
it's true though
this is an oddly strange time to be calling me out
Gene all your memes are from reddit, you should have seen this (yes I'm calling you out here and now)
we're asking you to spill
wait what?
That‚Äôs rough.
i have not heard this story and I am intrigued
that's oddly specific
like that reddit couple with the surprise micro penis on wedding night
hey if your Christian that may be the first time you see them naked
Undies is more than half naked.
Gene to answer your question, I can't say for sure but I don't think shoes matter all that much, if you have a foot fetish bare foot is the way to go
lmao
too bad
so much for wanting to marry him
i don't mind hearing inappropriate things. i just don't need half-naked noah in my mind ever again
or this server
gene, if you don't wanna hear wildly inappropriate everythings, get out of nsfw
noah, if you wanna talk about what you're wearing, go on omegle or something
I don't think I have but I don't remember
Damn
And no camera around
god dammit
*nothing but my underwear*
guess what I'm wearing right now <@!258094439636008971>
speaking of which, this group needs to go to pine like at some point while it's still hot out
That's where the 8/10 comes from
i think we all have at this point
noah, you fucking video called us at 2AM with nothing but your underwear on
Sophomore year yeah
Jarrett has seen me shitless before, right?
so you'll have to wait a bit
this is gay and I ship it
jarrett: *talking about having a shoulder fetish*
also jarrett: noah i showed you my shoulder please respond
my phone is currently recovering (hopefully) from water damage
Speaking of which Noah you owe me a picture of your shoulder still
idk man
super harmless, but also really common for some reason
<@!503787499605458954> agreed, but does this still do anything?
That's why shoulders are superior
foot fetishes are... interesting
I feel like a nice pair of strappy sandals n shit would do a lot more for you
does the hideousness of the shoe offset the foot fetish?
which is an interesting question
like come on, can we not get some doped up super solider shit to do it
flat out hideous tho
they're just
A foot fetish is mostly based upon the shape of the foot as well as the skin on it so I would say that they would matter mildly as you can see a more defined shape of the foot
I just find that hard to believe
clothes are for the weak
can we talk about the fact that no woman has even gotten with 10 seconds of a 4 min mile
if he's playing botw, tell him to have link take off his clothes and start talking to people because it's the only way to play the game
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-distance_running
<@!193229269076279298> a sprint is 200m or less
He's playing breath of the wild rn so ill give you the answer that hes kinda told me
"Middle-distance running"
I mean what else?
<@!233062637922025472> we need your insight
long distance?
also, sincere question, because jiayi never fully answered this: are people with foot fetishes into those shoes with toes (which are objectively horrifying, but i imagine they exist for a certain audience)?
then what is it?
No....
1600m not a considered a sprint?
Also whoa there a mile is not a sprint
it's like for engines torque vs horsepower
Most world class sprinters also dope so i dunno if theyre a good measure
it's the ratio between how often you can put your feet on the ground vs how much power you get out of pushing off with your legs
also <@!503787499605458954> i think i'm officially correct on the knees thing
most word class sprinters are 6'
Type 2 levers Noah
that's the move
and if mario kart is any indicator
if anything, being shorter gets you a faster acceleration
to a point it does
also ^
being tall does not help you run faster
a stiff breeze would blow jarrett off the track
that's only bc
you're 6', I'm 5' 6" with arthritis who hates cardio
rip
That is most likely true
speaking of ankles, do men's ankles and women's ankles have significant differences?
Jarrett I can beat you in a mile run
Ever flex on Noah by having a functioning body?
you just want ankles to burn bc yours burn you lol
ankles can be great
they can burn too
chaps can look good
I think ankles can be good looking.
oh fuck ankles as well
yeah, that's probably it
ankles can be weird, but I think this is a you thing
elbows don't have the floating knee cap
it's weird tho
no one finds elbows problematic
no one finds ankles problematic
knees are fucking terrifying
if it looked good it looks better, if it looked bad it looks worse
Covers the knees whilst leaving access.
ass-less chaps just augment it
ass-less chaps
Chaps are the solution to ya problems.
ok so you're on "not seeing other people's knee's is salvation" side
we wear pants so people don't have to see each other's knees on the regular idk
I can't tell if you consider getting in someone pants salvation or not seeing their knees salvation
only if they make sense
let me make my thanos quotes
salvation?
<@!193229269076279298> a small price to pay for salvation
ooooh
relatively nice
<@!258094439636008971> then why do we try to get people to take them off?
less ugly is different from nice
like I think in general knees are p gnarly but I have definitely noticed that some people have less ugly knees than others
<@!193229269076279298> no
Why cant people just have stick legs and no knee?
this is the real reason we wear pants
idk, everyone whip out your phone and take a photo of your knee
you just have to like ignore the knees exist on people
lmao
Man its such a turnoff when the person I'm with has knees
yes
yes?
^
Can a person have nice knees?
<@!278660908212027392> hey you never told us about your knee fetish
upper leg can be nice
lower leg can be nice
the center is just disturbing
or does that mean you can only run like hell
again, knees are like the opposite of a fetish for most people
come up with a better kinematic system
that means you can't run like hell
does anyone here really
if your knees burn in hell
do you think knees are attractive?
but I'm sure there's people who are
they can go burn in hell
dude idk I'm not into it
I can say I hate knees
What about them tho?
someone is gonna find knees hot
katya go off
damn jarrett coming in with the rating
gene cannot be correct
lmao
im here
what's the opposite of a fetish
why was a summoned for this
cindy
wtf
legs in general look best when you start to get differentiation between the muscles in the legs, not just them being big
knees are fucking scary, fam. i'm sorry.
<@193229269076279298> your shoulders are like a solid 8/10 last time I checked
alright @everyone who's got a knee fetish
knees cannot be attractive
rarely knees
the knees
or like
when people compliment legs, are they usually talking upper or lower leg
I don't pay as much attention to specific details tho
guys with good Legs in general are very attractive
`The attractiveness of a shoulder varies wildly from person to person`
"attractiveness varies wildly from person to person"
fixed it
guys can have amazing calves too
üëå
ESPECIALLY when a girl is wearing heels
when you can see the line of the muscle
on everyone
so many people are top heavy
nice calves are really attractive in general
good calves are hard to come by
tbh I find good calves really attractive on girls
it was like the thing
The attractiveness of a shoulder varies wildly from person to person
yeah
*everyone* back then did
remember when we had that person come in when we studied romeo and juliet and they were like "yeah, fam, shakespeare had a fetish for calves"?
well ok yea noah's correction applies
something something mixed messages
depends on the quality of the shoulders
they can be
they are
Seriously though are shoulders not an extremely attractive part of the human body?
a kink would be if you liked biting people's shoulders
go gene go
hahaha
*big kink
<@!503787499605458954> you do not get to deem what is acceptable
do the big think
everything is a kink if you think hard enough
Ah yeah my bad
i'm pretty sure that's a fetish and not a kink
I just think it's funny
shoulders are an acceptable kink
"we can only hold hands when the moon is waning"
i do not want to read anything other cindy wrote
what was this
If people can have foot fetishes then shoulders should be an acceptable kink
document?
oh dear god
oh god
we all find people attractive
also you gotta share the (other) Cindy relationship document you wrote
what if
we protect the herd
utilitarianism
Less of a thesis and more of a general outline
it means we get rid of you
no gene
if i find people in general attractive, does is mean we can ban everyone from school?
wait this is an actual thing
oh god
Shit man I wrote it like 2 years ago
rip
please I want to read your ***Thesis***
lmao
are you the reason off shoulder tops are banned in schools
said you find them attractive yes
thesis no
Both male and female
and yes it should hurt
go get a deep tissue massage
Noah have I told you my thesis on the fact that shoulders are one of the most attractive parts of the human body?
people... r e l a x
is that a compliment?
rip
like holy shit
everyone has tight shoulders
oh one other thing
shoulders: just have them

those are my thoughts on shoulders
well defined shoulders can really help bring form together
often neglected muscle group in favor of the arms and chest
How do you feel about shoulders Noah?
and I want to hear
well I'm a person
Probably nothing people want to hear
<@!173668455856340994> anything of note
how is the nsfw side of everyone's life going
well it's been a while people
Oh
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Syrian_Army
What is FSA exactly?
which applies to most of the middle east actually
Google spat of FSA as being "flexible spending account" or "federal student aid"
who are terrorists depending on which government you ask
was FSA
also I was wrong, wasn't ISIS
na 4chan has a record for finding any place in under 24 hrs
https://imgur.com/gallery/5P1N1GI
That doesn't sound like helping take down ISIS. That sounds like being part of ISIS and being an idiot for somehow even more reasons than just being part of ISIS.
So they helped take down ISIS by having people be part of ISIS that Russia decided to take coordinates from?
mostly because Russia is willing to take random internet strangers coordinates as a reliable form of information for airstrikes
Also, I feel like they've had a net negative impact either way
Explain?
hey they've helped take down ISIS
How about we just exterminate 4chan instead cuz it's fucking 4chan
don't bother, they'll be gone in a bit
isn't ok 4chan will exterminate them eventually
and like a lot of theory, isn't not very accurate
I clearly do not understand much about this and kinda feel bad for not now
***in theory***
**in theory**
*in theory*
you identify as an animal, animals also have sex but the point isn't supposed to be sex
Because with pressure, you're not gonna break anything unless it's sharp enough to puncture skin (at which point it's just a cut)
furry is like transgender from what I understand
And probably impact
at least not necessarily
Good to know
and yes furry is not sexual in nature
so pressure or impact
That's cool then
Oh ok
If I'm correct, bruising is the breaking of capillaries underneath the skin
I did know you were typing though
<@!258094439636008971> I was at the top of the conversation and slowly typing my thoughts as I scrolled down, so I never dropped to the bottom and couldn't see your messages
alright I'm all caught up
`I think I've mentioned this before (possibly at a party) but I'm weirdly into bruising
not like getting beaten up but like for example marks on my wrists n shit`
now I need to look up how bruises are exactly caused, can you just crush veins?
<@!340319804747415553> care to enlighten me
`I like how the description for bondage just includes "Reddit has a number of communities dedicated to this"`
`and doesn't reddit have anything
and everything`
<@!520095106888630348> is correct
reddit has a community for everything you know of and everything you don't know of
`and here i had asian slurs thrown at me in gym class by one asshat`?
`Btw the fact that this is #2 most popular in 2019  kinda says something about the anime community haha`
remember eromanga sensei
remember domestic girlfriend
the anime community is trash and that's why we love it
I feel like I'm being ignored here
just a solid show?
`So I just watched the first episode of this anime today called "miru tights" which is literally entirely about girl's wet feet in tights, and no particular sexual attraction felt so I think I've lost my foot fetish by now`
uh so why are you watching it <@!233062637922025472>?
So is being a furry not sexual in nature then?
That's actually surprisingly useful clarification
just wanting to bang animals is bestiality
furry is when you think you're an animal
`The only thing I'd be concerned about is if someone had a lion fetish`
`that's called a furry`
no, that's bestiality
saint nicholas
Eh
Nukes
Guns
`Also lions are better at killing than people`
hmm 420 pounds of raw killing muscle, what do you think
Ancient Greece
Also we're talking like
Can you though?
`Are there lions in Greece?`
if buy lions and bring them to Greece then yes
oh yea incognito does nothing to hide stuff from your isp
Talking about necrophilia again
you have fun noah
well my internet's out in 4 mins so
... oh no
Oh boi
I should got back through it and say my parts now
I was reading through it while playing Overwatch with Jarrett
oh I forgot about this conversation
"Hey, doc. How about a booster shot?"
"Fam, we just got you one last week"
"JUST DO IT OR I'LL JUST START STABBING MYSELF AS A MEANS OF GETTING OFF"
And how do you even go about that
That's so oddly specific
Why is there one for vaccinations
So I read through the whole thing
Uh
Also, there's something in here based off of electricity, so the Detective Pikachu kink is legit
that's kinky
It's a running joke that Lifan is a tree, and Ansen keeps making not-subtle jokes about him being a "sexy tree"
what
Make a group chat with Ansen and Lifan, drop that definition, and leave the group chat
it's like uh
to the lighthouse and the phallic shape of lighthouses
"Dendrophilia:¬†also known as Arbophilia. A sexual attraction to trees, either because they are phallic-shaped or because of the texture. May overlap with xylophilia."
Ok, I think I found one
Reddit has too much
hickies are nice, not entirely what I was referring to tho
and everything
and doesn't reddit have anything
hickies?
lol
I like how the description for bondage just includes "Reddit has a number of communities dedicated to this"
not like getting beaten up but like for example marks on my wrists n shit
I think I've mentioned this before (possibly at a party) but I'm weirdly into bruising
Lol don't apologize for the website
it's the first thing that came up when i googled lists of kinks
anyways. interesting
oh yea sorry
I just skimmed it I didn't really pay attention lol
oh right
Links to shit
There's like
Are you guys not getting that?
what
I'm trying to get through this list, but every fifth section is an offer to "give my man better oral sex" or "have better orgasms"
blindfolding
no pressure I'm just curious
I'll look too I guess then
Oh ok
i'm trying to answer Cindy's question
Why do we have the list pulled up again tho?
Ya gotta catch 'em all tho, right?
I mean
i mean
you can't possibly get them all
So like the bugs and the scratching and shit??
there's way more than like 240
This is a list of the most *common* stuff??
Wait a sec
Clear it
You could just like
I mean I could've copy/pasted the link into a new incognito tab but I'm lazy and again my internet history is already fucked
Where your incognito at
good thing I wasn't on incognito
pulled it out of my internet history LMAO
https://badgirlsbible.com/list-of-kinks-and-fetishes
Is that what it's called?
i was looking for the bad girl bible
Noah also has a spreadsheet somewhere
Pinned messages
where's the kink list again
Sorry I don't have much to offer lol
I think it's pretty clear where I'm headed if my highest rating was 99% at vanilla
right, but it wasn't particularly specific
We literally did a test on this a while back
Also in regard to your question
Idk how that would work but interesting
I'm sure some people get off on the fact that their partners are vanilla
probably
Can you have a kink for not having a kink?
one you have and are willing to share
gene i'm sure that's a thing
like if i had the kink, i'd admit it, or what are my kinks?
Maybe someone finds it kinky that their partner has a kink(s)
before we went down that race rabbit hole I was gonna ask what the "worst" kink yall are willing to admit to is
Well like
what?
Having kinks
Or is that just like
Is it possible to have a kink for kinks?
KINKS
Midnight and whatnot
Since it's like
Do we wanna talk about something a little less heavy
It just wasn't something I had ever really considered before then
Idk
again, valid
Idk if I said like "um why you guys doing this" before leaving or just left, but I know I did leave fairly quickly cuz I wasn't really comfortable being a part of that
and they're also of that race
if it was clear that it wasn't serious
intervene
I never said I support it, just that I wouldn't like
So I can't really say I can support it
which is why it's weird/bad/offensive for people who aren't of the race in question to use it
I've never really seen it in Asian American culture tho
reclaimed it as a cultural thing
but they've like
for example it's become kind of a cultural thing for black kids to use the n-word addressing each other, happens a lot in music etc
Exactly
Yeah
Even if I did, I still don't know how I'd feels about it
it makes other people feel like they can use it with you
I'm not someone who grew up around having racial slurs thrown at me, so I don't feel I'm in a position to throw them around jokingly
approve
I don't like
situational
i don't really think it's ok
well, that's valid
I was not necessarily ok with it
so i had to go find that
my parents insisted that i send them the address for the training
well
I don't really care if parties involved are a) of the race in question and b) joking/their friends are ok w it
Going to sleep much?
rip
I still to this day have no idea what to make of that
I got thrown in a group chat with a bunch of Skyline people using a racial slur, but everyone there was Asian, and I was like "I do not know how I feel about this" and then just left
oh I know lol I'm just saying I don't think I've ever interacted w someone like, very overtly racist
Yike, that's pretty problematic tho in its own right tho
I don't think I've ever had an actual unironic slur thrown at me, I've only been casually objectified for being asian
but idk
Cuz I see no other reason to live in Idaho
yknow I wouldn't be surprised
Do people have potato fetishes?
Btw
G'night
She's talking about potatos
so g'night lol
enjoy
night love
i've got cpr training in the morning in seattle
I know you know I don't know what the hell you're talking about
anyway, i'm off to sleep
all the complexity without any of the emotional baggage
Lmao Salina
who needs human interactions when you can have complex polysaccharides
Be was nice while he was here, but he's kinda gone now. I hope he's doing alright tho.
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
again I don't remember this dude at all so
That's what I'm inclined to believe, but I haven't seen or heard from him in four years
well, some people require human interaction
i'm kidding but yeah
become one with the potatoes
or you could like
^
idk if he has a ton of choice in people
and i'm also inclined to agree with jane
i don't know if that's true anymore if those are who he's calling friends
yeah well there were kids at pine lake that were also full of shit
Got stuck in Nowhere, Idaho tho
Luke's a nice dude last I saw of him
Some Idaho randos he met
Not Luke
It was a Skype group chat with people I never met lmao
wait what
I thought they were just being edgelords for a solid 15 minutes
and here i had asian slurs thrown at me in gym class by one asshat
damn
damn
First time I ever had someone use a racial slur against me
I have basically 0 recollection
I feel like I should remember this guy but I do not
what
wait
Yeah, his friends were interesting
But yeah, he thought Jane and I we're twins for the longest time
*rip*
Kinda nice but then moved to Idaho and become a lowkey redneck somehow and introduced me to some of his friends in a group chat who turned out to be unironic racists which he subsequently had to apologize for
yeah
Blonde kid
He played clarinet
whomst?
From middle school
no
Y'all remember Luke McGarvey?
you guys should try to convince someone you know that you're long lost twins
yea
Less and less so as the years of on tho
but it happens
not that often
People actually think we're related every now and then tbh
Oh
We've discussed this
but sure
I was more thinking of just the last name thing
Maybe you two are long lost twins separated at birth
In the thinking alike way?
we kinda already are aren't we
Idk
We can be siblings or something tho, Cindy
this is true
yikes
<@520095106888630348> is my real twin anyways
Fair
at least you admit it
I will never accept that
except your mcu ranking is blasphemy
We did it again there too while we were calling it out
Dude
<@503787499605458954> twins
great minds think alike
Just his pelvic region
put the eggplant emoji over his dick
No
Somebody should make an edit of infinity war where they replace thanos with an eggplant
like a full helping of dessert
Is it a flannel salad?
looking like a real snack
that's the real dish
üçÜ
flanos
stop
Sounded like a dish for a second
I'm aware lmao
oh god
is cursed
That
t h a d d y
I can make more daddy thanos jokes then
Oh, good
not really
if anything i'm calling myself out too, i do it a lot
nah it's fine
I feel like there is some shade being thrown in my general direction
Excuse me
sorrryyyy
better than most people in this chat
Thank you for this, uh, knowledge, Jiayi lol
I mean, at least he put it in nsfw
Btw the fact that this is #2 most popular in 2019  kinda says something about the anime community haha
oddly specific
that is
well
... uh
https://anilist.co/anime/106967/Miru-Tights
I'm not even kidding
So I just watched the first episode of this anime today called "miru tights" which is literally entirely about girl's wet feet in tights, and no particular sexual attraction felt so I think I've lost my foot fetish by now
People are free to like what they will
Never said they shouldn't
yeah they can be funny and I'm sure the participants will also often find it funny/stupid sometimes but yknow what unless it involves anything non-consensual and/or permanent harm they can do what they want
Then again, people just like sex jokes
I think it's less that people see them as bad and more as like people find them funny for some reason
Alright, I get you
a whole other league than liking to be spanked
ok but that's like
I get what you're saying tho lol
Necrophilia
But then there's like
at least
pretty much everyone has one
I wish kinks weren't seen as weird/bad
Example?
i would argue that there are ones that exist
When people talk about them
Cuz to my knowledge, there's just "less weird ones" and "bad" ones
Is there a such thing as a good fetish or kink?
i should be really concerned shouldn't i
yikes
Ok, real question cuz that last idea was boring
Wait, this was a bad idea, cuz the answer for all of them is Noah
Who does that best describe in the server?
Formicophilia: arousal by insects or by insects crawling on and nibbling the body. The fetish for bees and wasps specifically is known as melissophilia while an attraction to spiders is known as arachnophilia.
Scroll randomly and pick a random one
I'm just scrolling through but they have links to like. a bunch of wikis, reddits q&as, etc etc for almost everything
for both of those things lol
i... don't think i ever needed to know that
yknow, this list is actually impressively sourced
But hey, in defense of the furry community, they actually pay their artists
Oh you're right
hahaha jane
Actually, knowing Greece, that's probably why it was a bad thing to be a lion
that's called a furry
The only thing I'd be concerned about is if someone had a lion fetish
who knows
Also lions are better at killing than people
so
and nemea was in the area
but the nemean lion was a thing
shrug
Are there lions in Greece?
see hercules/heracles
and wearing your skin
people like poking you with sharp sticks
I see this as an absolute win
if we're talking ancient greece
simba and nalaa
well my dude
What's wrong with being a lion
i'm sure there's more but i'm *tired*
atalanta and meleager got turned into lions bc aphrodite got salty they didn't give her offerings after they got married
I won't ask
Rip
I don't really give a shit tho my internet providers have seen enough weird shit from me
a lot of bad endings is bc they don't honor aphrodite
if you think about it
discord didn't let me open it in incognito
I like how we can't even stop being nerds while talking about a list of fetishes from the "bad girl bible"
a p big part of their happy ending is that they just kept aphrodite happy and brought her offerings and shit
"aw, shit, this is way less kinky. Buzzkill, Aphrodite"
not piss her off
that's why you gotta
yeah i know
false salina aphrodite was the pettiest bitch usually when she gets involved it is v v bad
she also thought galatea was pretty enough to warrant her attention basically
aphrodite was salty that the women on the island didn't honor her so she made them all sluts
and the Pygmalion was like "all women are sluts i'm just gonna make one myself" and Aphrodite liked him so while he was doing the do with his statue she turned the statue into a real woman
goddess of lurveeeee
especially aphrodite
Everything ends happily when the gods help satisfy your kinks
*surprise*
nvm! rare case
that's what I meant w the reference/allusion thing
they lived happily ever after basically
nah
I think it ended badly but idr
pygmalion and galatea
where a sculptor sculpts his "ideal woman" and then one of the gods brings her to life or smth
Oh?
Like wtf
ah the name is an allusion to this greek myth
I think that's just incest and pedophilia
but also that sounds so fucked lmfao
U H
`Pygmalionism, an attraction to items of one‚Äôs own creation`
"AW YES GIMME THAT SWEET SUNLIGHT"
u sure you're not a plant if that's how you feel
I know I was about to be like
It's just photosynthesis
Photosynthesis
Lmao
rough way to live
`arousal by the rays of the sun`
nails can be sexy but when you say it like that it's just awkward
There are people who have sex with mannequins
like I get what they're going for
why does that instantly make it sound less attractive
Lmao
`arousal from scratching`
but i think cole would sooner murder me and i enjoy being alive
Sorry what did I miss
well there's a joke to be made there
jk jk
yikes
....
been there done that
*sure*
are you
i'm not about to have sex with a mannequin if that's what you're asking
is this really something you're just searching up for shits and giggles
also uh jane
what are you hiding
so gene
i submit this one as worse
"Agalmatophilia: a person with this fetish is aroused by statues, mannequins or other figurative representations. This may be related to Pygmalionism, an attraction to items of one‚Äôs own creation."
hell, we've literally had this image floating around on the internet for over a year now|
you guys think i'm kidding, but i genuinely have trouble understanding this
but like that can't be it, right?
but he's far from the only mcu character with bde
ok, facts
He's got that bde
like, is it cuz he's powerful purple shrek?
or maybe the best part idk
but the worst part is that's actually a thing
daddy thanos
so yeah
i was in film, watching infinity war with michelle, and michelle just says ‚Äúdaddy‚Äù really loudly
<@!460689096646590465> yes, daddy thanos
it goes back way before the ant-man thing
Probably started with the Ant-Man up his ass thing
daddy thanos?
why do we jokingly sexualize thanos of all characters
ok, i have to ask
an atrocity that makes me want to no longer be a part of the human race
What is that
"ribbed for your pleasure"
i hate everything about this
I'm dead
LOL the comment
and i was just going through reddit innocently
bitch
spill already
a perfectly not terrible day
i was having
For some reason people just dont like vaping in certain bathrooms
Depends on the bathroom
Ohhh that's pretty fair
the smell of vape is probably more common than the shit smell
Synthetic blue raspberry is a stretch
Shit yes
<@258094439636008971> I think you need your sense of smell checked out by a doctor
"unisex" for having one sex
in my experience they're not necessarily always gross though
yeah they are
Oh is that the one that's unisex
I think I recall it being a DECA thing tho, so that sounds right
<@472541429130854421> Wait, the hell? They're single bathrooms?
Also @theguys I need to prove a point, but the bathrooms smell strongly like a mix of synthetic blue raspberry and shit 80% of the time, right?
because they're very private
people probably have sex in it pretty regularly
probably the single bathrooms near the deca room on the third floor
@everyone There's a really sketchy bathroom at Skyline, right? I forget which one it is, but y'all keep mentioning it from time to time.
Spoiler alert: Thanos actually goes up Antman's ass
Sure, Endgame was fun and all, but it would have been nice to have had a 4D theater for that scene when Ant-Man went up Thanos's ass

jiayi some subs you may like more
it's the embodiment of the internet
reddit is everything at once fam
na reddit is nice
Reddit is a scary scary place
i.e they're not joking when they post
oh dear god no
but I can direct you to some subs of people that actually like what they post there
top-tier pin skills
of course it is
that's r/copypasta
Like what sub reddit do you go to to find stuff like that
Noah where do you even find posts like that?
Hahaha I'm sorry
speaking of which how many upvotes did that get
possibly a pint of bleach to wash it all down
ok that thought was way more disturbing than noah's shitpost
i need holy water and pure wholesome hugs
time for me to leave
...jiayi
... welp
oh JESUS
***a b s u r d i s m***
We were actually talking about serial killers one time in LA/SS, and I remember somebody said that the creepiest thing about surviving a night out with Ted Bundy is that his penis that was inside you was inside several other dead bodies before
*a b s u r d i s m*
oh, wait
* a b s u r d i s m *
yeah I was laughing my ass off
i don't know why that's so funny
(I've discussed this with a disturbing number and variety of people)
oh my gosh
i'm laughing so hard
i would say yes
i'm looking at you medulla oblongata
if you fuck them after all signs of life have scientifically stopped
is it necrophilia if they die in the middle of sex
bringing up the age-old question
noah's into necrophilia confirmed
well, we're putting this server to good use
my takeaway
That was something
ok
My goodness
wow
what the fuck
so you have to suffer as well
oh boy
i'm concerned
nOAH
and I read it
.......................
because I want others reaction to it
here read this
physically cringed in pain reading some of that
oh wait
i
or very small teeth
2nd thought was kinda giving me memories of stuff that I've read that I've wanted to forget
dickshark
..............
gotta have a pretty big opening
dick with teeth, hmm
no thanks guys
2nd thought was sounding
thanks for that helen
ok my first mental image was literally a dick w teeth
we're not into sounding here
nothing is supposed to go up it
oh god
but consumes?
how about covers or something
consumes?
just void
there is nothing beyond
noah's dick consumes all
what's next
hands ---> skin ---> noah's dick ---> ???
damn
if you don't, don't
if you got a comment make it
yeah he can keep flexing about all the sex he's not having
then don't bring it up
noah will not be so generous\
Shit she has experience
nah I'll keep that part of my life to myself thank u very much
make them then bitch
I could make a lot of comments
we got that already
don't use lotion as lube for sex
i have no comments on this conversation, yet i feel the need to acknowledge i've witnessed this exchange
ok clarification
not speaking from experience?
That sounds awful
Maybe when masturbating maybe? Idk might help if you're beating it so hard you start to get friction burns
when you're tryna fuck but don't have lube
I can't really think of a situation where you put lotion on your dick
uh no, I'm not that dumb
yeah really don't, i'm speaking from theory
yknow what it's for the good of the order this time
there he goes speaking from experience again
PSA: don't use lotion as lube
oh wait yeah gene you're right
or at least is sold that way
make things *moist*
yeah, hand lotion is its own specific thing
is it really
one use is different from the others...
kinda the point
i just want to say, the lotion applies for all 3 body parts we've discussed
i like having someone pay for my chipotle
i hope so too
none of which involved noah's dick, I hope
for...
lotion
is the...
from three separate incidents
*lotion*
speaking of hands, i have three deeper-than-papercuts on my right hand
oh wait
I haven't clicked yet and I'm already mildly insulted
...............
hands, skin and my dick
i'm not going to watch that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryA4PNdzj-U
this is relevant to all these things
here.
hands, skin, and now specifically noah's dick
we've just gone from one body part to another
this is a fat mood
rip
speaking of skin, i keep sabotaging my own efforts to improve it
we've already talked about hands. let us talk about skin for now until another body part/organ catches our interest.
this chat is for holesome conversation
this is too wholesome for this chat
hye to you too
hey hey hey
i've never seen someone irl give a backhanded compliment or being patronizing that way
nah it's usually genuine
rip
i admire people's skin but don't generally compliment (now that i think of it, probably due to my own insecurity)
pretty much all of my friends are fucked up in some way to some degree so like
i have never seen another guy been given a skin compliment, and hearing that they get them makes me feel more secure, cuz i was paranoid for the longest time that people were being patronizing whenever they mentioned my skin
not that i'm one to talk
i think you need to find less messed up guys
h
u
so that's also pretty dark
usually when I compliment guys on skin they joke about me sounding like I wanna cut it off and wear it
i mean
my mom's a good person
it came out meaner than intended tbh
that got dark
yikes
.....................
thanks. it comes complimentary with my mom's problematic personality in my family's genetic package
gene you have super nice skin
american sunscreens suck ass
lliterally feels like nothing
thanks
any recommendations?
i recommend biore aqua rich watery essence
i have people comment on my skin a lot, and i'm not sure if they're trying to be condescending or are genuinely curious
some are really nice
sunscreen makes my skin so gross tho
Asian don‚Äôt raisin. But also wear sunblock.
i just use moisturizer then spf
I think I need to find a moisturizer I actually like that has spf
jk
things just got salty up in here
rip
i would tho if the usc gods had chosen to bless me
same, but i'm indoors like at all times anyways
I should start doing that tbh
90% of skin aging is due to sun
if you use sunscreen all the time you'll look much much younger
i think my mom looks 40 and she's actually 46
and i don't get it
the last years have been a bit more noticeable, but she still looks really young. like, shave off 15-20 years
mid-to-late 50s
I think she looks younger than my mom
I think Gene's mom looks like 50-55
yea so you've said
*i was a mistake*
bc your mom looks. a lot younger than she actually is
dude gene I was shooketh when I found out you had a 13-years-older brother
could have taken her husbands last name for all I know
idk
what did you expect
is maners an asian last name
my mom looks younger than her, but that's more of a testament to my mom looking 20 years under her age
well then
no
she has wrinkles and stuff
is manners Asian?
my mom looks younger than her tbh
i think she definitely looks her age
ok another twin brain moment
I KNOW RIGHT
i always thought late 30s, but then she hits us with the whole 20 years
she talks about teaching for 20 years but I keep thinking she's like 30something and it throws me off so much
almost as old as my parents
she keeps saying she's old, but she looks fairly young
45
dude ok how old is maners
damn
my math teacher explicitly told us last year she kinda had to drink to get through grading our math tests cuz it was kinda disappointing
seems about right
but a mother who partakes in getting wine wasted on occasion
not like an actual alcoholic
60% sure she is
didn't someone say maners seemed like a wine mom?
ah, the good ol cycle of alcoholism
it helps you get to Fridays so then you can really drink
Thursday is the perfect day to day drink
i looked away for five minutes, and you guys start talking about having an orgy again smh
I resent your comment about day drinking on Thursdays
oh that remind me
maybe you were day drinking like <@!472541429130854421>
it's not even that late why am I like this
me neither
I don't even know what's happening anymore
oops
oh I already used loaf
yote the loaf
yeet the wheat
loaves
the
acquire
get that bread
jk hahaha
i love me a good sugar daddy
good point
not when it comes to my wallet
your loss
i think i'll take noah instead of the writhing mass of orgy limbs
sorry yall it's loopy hours
yikes
fuck I said I would stop
if noah's not doin it for you come to our orgy
I mean
oh wait
or triplets
I know but I couldn't come up w an appropriately offensive response to that
i don't think any of us have the genetic capability of having twins
Wow
i was gonna say i have better things to do than noah
lmaoooo
damn
ok I'll stop lmao sorry
better things to do than use a condom? that's the kind of attitude that leaves you w triplets up for adoption
too bad she's bitchy and infuriating as an actual teacher
i have better things to do!
it's times like this that I actually do appreciate her personality
wtf cindy
"As a teacher of 20 years, I know the kinds of things you guys do after hoco/prom, and I don't want to know about it."
<@!193229269076279298> <@!340319804747415553> use protection thank u
Triplets met their mother "it was a prom night knock up sort of thing"
Maners: YOU HEAR THAT? Make good choices
that's not incredibly shady
lol
hahaha
lmao
right
Movie: You don't just roll around on the floor with someone you just met
Maners: Well...
it was a sex insinuation idr what it was tho
<@!258094439636008971> <@520095106888630348> what was the thing she said during the movie
always tells us to make good choices etc
?
she kinda shady
I'm so sorry
what was the comment?
I regret everything
(fuck that class)
maners is our tok teacher
go back to the other chat
so
`maners kink thing`?
does knowing which hand make a difference
to be fair, jane thought he said Mariners when she connected it to kinks
just assume every guy jerks it it's nothing to freak out over
NO
GENE
let's not mention it ever again
the most horrifying thing there was the maners kink thing
Hey, I mean, I've been cursed with this extensive knowledge of Noah's habits since sophomore year, and it still haints me
*laughs in sad*
but seriously if you want to talk about college choices feel free to msg me
i came from the prom chat
I was like ???
holding the mouse w both hands at the same time
I'm lost what's so bad?
alas alack wherefore art my precious innocence
I thought you meant like
do you mean to have caps on?
oh
OH NO
AND I CAME BACK TO THIS
I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE TO GO FOR COLLEGE
?
AHHH
NO IDEA
I JUST COME BACK TO
DID
WHAT
also i love how as soon as we move over to nsfw the conversation moves away from it
if you're writing with your right hand and want to use the mouse too
wtf is happening
when your right hand hurts from using a mouse too much
when one side gets tired
why would you ever tho
me
also how many of you guys can use a mouse with both hands?
so I want to know what percentage of people use their dominant hand for jerking
two inches'n sucking
one inches suck
I've come to the conclusion I can't talk to anyone in inches anymore
let's say like the top 5-7 listed for each person
<@!460689096646590465> lots of people
yeah
so do I take both people's high points?
but each person has different high and low points
how did the spectrum get so big
the middle ones are usually less telling
ah
yeah
like instead of comparing every single point, compare just each person's highest and lowest points
the first few and last few?
i think those points are most important
?
wait can you change the algorithm so that it only reads the first few and last few results for comparison
yes
i dumb
oh right just backwards
just reversed
it's the same graph
uh yea
do you have a similarity graph? i feel like that's more revealing
that's true
yea
looks like jarrett just generally gets very different results from the most people
Jarrett you and Emily now take the top spot for most different
They don't think it be like it is, but it do
Speak much in few words.
No, I feel like I have learned a lot.
it really do be like that sometime
<@503787499605458954> and to answer that, this is very definitely the lowest quality conversation we've ever had
They be like that sometimes
Kids? Kids be out there sayin such stuff.
Did not mean to pin that
W two c‚Äôs.
I believe that the kids on the street these days would describe it as "thicc af"
Thicc
A phat ass?
not everyone has an ***ass***
everyone has an ass
having an ***ass***, is different than having an ass
Noah would beg to differ
Accepted.
Bitch and thot are not mutually exclusive terms.
This deserves a pin.
I thought thots had asses.
this is either the lowest or highest quality conversation we've ever had
Yes, bitches usually have asses.
No, ass bitch
Why.
Rude ass.
bitch ass?
Big. Whoop.
Ass indeed.
Bitch.
Ass?
Die.
Sheesh.
Yikes.
Damn.
Fuck.
Just ass.
Ass.
***a e s t h e t i c***
the periods make me think she's angry
a e s t h e t i c
Assthetic
do it for the
It‚Äôs all right but my phone autocorrects anyway. And I have an aesthetic to uphold.
exhibit A: `what the specific grammar rules`
the appropriate use of the word the
I like coming off as more casual
what the specific grammar rules I ignore?? idk it just kinda happens
Thought you knew this.
Ya. Have for a while.
fascinating
wait Bethany you use snapchat?
oddly specific
that is
^
Bethany types a lot of periods in her snaps
to punctutate
hit enter
idk I just
I tend to ignore capitalization and not use enough commas
i would describe it as just really punctuated
We have all degenerated.
It best conveys my feels.
it sounds v formal
you remind me of how ramya used to text
you have really good grammar
Material.
Found it. And eep that‚Äôs sensitive.
the pins in this channel are particularly interesting
it's good to have power
like the vids i have of noah dancing
instant blackmail material
basically posts that have been marked for easy viewing at any time
Question what are pinned things?
but at least he finally reciprocated
<@!503787499605458954> we're twins
sad
alright
definitely less
less
less
is that more or less nsfw?
yikes
dick me down hard gene
pinned cuz it's probably the most nsfw thing ever said here
that's a mood
i want hugs
idk
or turtles
or pikachu throws
in hugs
<@!258094439636008971> will pay you to
if it's about noah, not only is it acceptable, but it's also encouraged
Then this aught to be a good time.
and even then as long as the roast was fair
as long as nobody dies
any and all
I mean. I don‚Äôt know what levels of savage are acceptable.
so my vote still goes to jane
also, the only people you'd be comfortable roasting here is me and noah
you hardly contribute anything to this server, so it's hard for you contribute that much savagery
then you must infiltrate it
i mean
But my savage levels are limited by my knowledge of this system.
Hey das me.
I'm pretty sure she's the most savage
well we have <@561219716429905920>
https://tenor.com/view/phoebe-buffay-friends-thank-you-gif-10408632
it's good to have you back I missed our resident savage
damn
gene
some dumb shit
Quick, someone say some dumb shit so we can pin it
yea it has
that was before the airpod revolution
damn it's been a WHILE
oh wow the last thing pinned is still "you can store things in a vagina"?
like the graphing era
"the era's of the nsfw chat"
yea we need more like a summary for new members
Yeah, if you have that much time to waste, you kinda deserve this info
if you have that much time to waste
please don't
go off
I have no shame
...........................................
<@173668455856340994> if you have like 12 hours you can read through all this
._.
hate you
i
we can only learn from it
the past is the past
That's something only Sasha can do tbh
frack
nope
lock this shit up
can we like
oh god
That's your fault
we haven't used this in a while
oh lol
How about you sleep more than 5 hours
Hahaha legendary sleep schedule
I did. From 5:30 to 10:45.
BETHANY,  S L E E P
I got up at 9:30 today lmao
4:45 is a very reasonable time to be up.
rip
But yes, Noah's a very questionable individual.
What's more questionable is what you're doing up at 4:54 AM.
This is all very questionable. Congratulations.
ü§î ü§î ü§î
hm
Something something ice bath
Are we sure it's just a meme in Noah's case
rigor mortis, bitches
sleeping with cold hard machines might explain the necrophilia meme
i mean
why
Do you speak from personal experience?
....
I would agree, sleeping with people isn't something you should do at work
sleep is nsfw bc you're not supposed to do it at work
Well Gene do you have some nsfw topic you wish to discuss
I'm sorry. I hope y'all get the chance to rest soon
Y i k e
no sleep for the carry
i CANNOT
S l e e p
i like black coffee too
so tired
jk
what's coffee w/o sugar anyway? :p
Im
a b s o r b
get you a sugar daddy first ;P
I need to immerse myself
someone buy me an espresso pool
sad
it's like an espresso pool but like
look i've just been over here wallowing in my depresso hole
That was neither confirmation nor denial
L M A O
Jkjk
<@340319804747415553> *O h*
O h
Oh
Sorry all my degeneracy has been focused... elsewhere
You laugh, but it's the truth
lmfao
This server is so much more tame without Noah being a degenerate on a nightly basis
He has a  r e s p o n s I b i l i t y
Doesn't matter, Salina
Wait I'm confused
but rip
he's at wsu doing college things
<@193229269076279298> w e a k
TOTAL DEPRAVITY
hm is this about religion or about this chat
is this a thing?
so i didnt know this was a thing
uh yeah
anyone else want to weigh in?
uh not that i know of
do girls have a similar reaction/phrase?
so Gabe just sent me this as a joke "https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fap%20on%20it"
oh no
question then
alright
make me regret this
it's gotta be degenerate up in here
lol what
we'll see
idk
eh
<@!193229269076279298> WELL??
humans are ok, generally
what was the original general description
On it
since it applies to pretty much everything we say here
maybe use the new one as the General channel description?
tho this current description is also pretty rad
Also <@193229269076279298> are you gonna deliver on that promise or what?
I petition to change this channel's description to "Do you guys think that because we are on Discord, we are going to act a little more unhinged?" -David
ah, good luck!
one more to go
answer the question first
that depends
uh is this the right channel?
you have any more left to go?
<@!193229269076279298> how are finals?
does anyone else want to offer their insights
I can really feel the progress
well this conversation is obviously going somewhere
|the only reason i live is to smell the lilacs another day|
because it isnt any fun üò¶
I asked ***why***
her bday is in aug
that's not an answer
oop
nope
wait, is today your bday <@!271149039020408843>?
its no fun because being legal isnt any fun üò¶
I never got an answer
mmh that's fair
Math is stupid there I said it
So I need to grind now
L
Equates me not doing any of the work then showing up presentation morning
don't die
take care <3
Just perhaps not tomorrow
rip
Yeah I'll prob make it on wed
just saying
they can't go w/o u
L
uh
But my tok group is present at on wednesday hahahahaha
I dont know if I'll be able to come tomorrow either
i'm sorry :(
ooof
Feels like someone is doing the max cohen pi thing to my brain
Goin into hot flashes every 4 min
*larynx and trachea
oof
Coughing my bronchioles out of my throat
that was an interesting sentiment to pop in with
I'm still 2 seconds away from straight up death
well i hope jeesoo is doing okay
lol
i agree
this is excellent advice
then do a yeet
lmao
ok maybe wait until after the ib test
ib tests
don't yeet yet
uh
therefore the logical conclusion is you must memorize, pass the test, then yeet it straight out of your brain
lol mood
having this knowledge stored in your brain is not conducive to good employable capacity because it will hinder your efforts to further your useful skills
not super-helpful for work
LOL
this math test is nsfw because it will never ever be relevant to your work
if you remember how to do the steps
don't need rigorous logic skills
a lot of it is memorization
i guess that math test was not safe for work
i agree with salina
i like how this is just a math discussion now
like recognizing the right patterns
a lot of it is just adapting concepts
Sounds good
you are good
if you can do the review and ib problems
i'm not gonna give away explicit problems but
i was quite confused
same tho
rip
It took me 30 min to even wrap my head around the question for the first time
Other than the stupid problem 7 was there any other significant stuff
the breakdown part is important bc it helps you adapt to that fucker of a test
and then broke it down step by step
but why is it no fun?
i did ib and review problems twice
Probably that is wh6
yes
i just checked my work until we almost ran out of time
Did you do the stuff
i thought it was okay
Wtf was math I heard bad things about it
It's just no fun being legal :(
a lot of people came out of math doing a hot panic
rip
I havent ever been so sick that I needed to stay home but here we are
even if the dodge was really being sick
I'm confused, are you saying it's more fun when you're not legal, or are you say it's no fun now that you're legal?
but today was prob a good day to dodge
Aww thank you
we missed you in school today
hang in there
rip
Thanks for the concern I appreciate that
ah rip
I'm just a little sick but itll be over soon
I meant drunk
you ok?
Hehe druno
mood
Yes I'm sober I just act dumb even when I'm not druno
We are all legal but it sure isnt any fun
<@!271149039020408843> you sober?
^
as noah has corrected me about many times aren't we all legal
Things like this are legal
quite confused
im
care to explain
It's no fun being legal :(
lol what
Its no fun being legal :(
Rip
it's hard for me to move on from something so scarring tbh
if you just don't respond I will stop caring
im aware
also telling me to forget about something has the complete opposite effect
just subtle morbid curiosity
it's not like an actual burning desire
but idk if you really want to see it
if you tell me how, i'll do it
i mean
or maybe not
it's possible for you to recover your own messages i think
i dont think i can
Don‚Äôt fall to the dark side
Don‚Äôt do it gene
Nopenopenope
Nope
part of me wants to dig into the server's log and see if i can undo the deletion
but the unholy was quite real
or at least he's pretending to be
and i sure as hell aint looking it up to send it
he's asleep
well you'll have to wait for tomorrow
i'm also curious
if you get it from noah, dm it to me too
understandable
I'm just curious
if you really wanna see it, just ask noah to dm it to you or something
salina very much has a point
but regardless
i think she's referring to the "intellectual insight" bit of the definition
nearsightedness?
I don't think that's the right word lmao
lack of imagination?
myopia as in
noah's standards for degeneracy are skewed by his own myopia
yup
^
unholy in the most literal sense possible
...
smh noah said it wasn't even that bad
it was
is that it was unholy
all you need to know
is anyone ever gonna tell me what it waaas
also <@!340319804747415553> i thought that was the joke you were making
<@!472541429130854421> noah brought uncomfortable nsfw to the cursed images channel earlier today, and i deleted it cuz i physically could not exist with that there
......... oh dear
<@!258094439636008971> yeah I'm sure noah has tried
i was wondering when we would get there
oh damn
oh so we might actually talk about nsfw tonight
bc nothing else round here is gonna get finished
f i n i s h  h e r
just finish it
y'all can figure out the implications
yknow what I'm not gonna finish that statement lmao
brace for impact
brace for impact, bitches
cindy found the caps lock
oh dear
i MEAN
lollll
^
can't you both be the beggar?
i mean
am i really the beggar in the relationship lol
<@!340319804747415553> lmao dont murder me sorry
question
also gene
yeah y'all are pure as fuck
cindy must have a wider range of friends than the majority of us then
damn gene
just that he's not the most degenerate friend I have
the nice thing to say would be "opposites attract"
the mean thing to say would be "beggars can't be choosers"
I'm not saying he's not a degenerate
congrats on dating a degenerate
you can get that checked off your bucket list
i now understand what you mean, and i am sincerely sorry for you
but usually he does
mmh that's fair
he did not censor himself at all earlier today
oh
like evidence
he censors himself a lot here
wait, receipts?
i have more than enough receipts
<@!503787499605458954> there you go
yes he's a fucking degenerate
hi
i'm here to cite some evidence
<@!340319804747415553> yes or no, is noah a degenerate?
<@!472541429130854421> lol
i used to think that
not actually that bad
When I typed that sentence auto complete suggested this emoji üí™
yknow noah's
noah's officially probably the most degenerate friend i have
I'm very proud of you for having your priorities straight
agreed
You should never aspire to be Noah level
so that's fine by me
i mean, i'm not at noah's level
oof
A sended the tears
but it's usually katya's job to come in and say "prnis" so idk
Congratulations you have ascended the tiers
at the time it was true
i mean
incredibly false
`that's the most I have to offer this channel`
oh jesus christ
also, this sounds like an extraordinarily cursed experiment, so let's not
<@!193229269076279298> books are made from paper and paper is made from plants
We will need clinical trials to prove a hypothesis
Uhhh...
discuss
nsfw time: if animals are allergic to plant sperm, are plants allergic to animal sperm?
That's the most I have to offer this channel
üÖ±enis
We don‚Äôt speak of that terribly phrased comment
....
I mean there was Salina's JSA comment, but that's about it for this month in nsfw group conversations
You‚Äôll be back to your regularly scheduled programming the following week
He has finals next week
come back there has been a distinct lack of "uncomfortably" inappropriate conversation
Lol rip
i would not be surprised
sometimes i wonder if you muted the entire server except this channel
it's because I've been talking less
yea
this is a record
just realized we haven't used this channel in almost a month
yes
are you feeling better
just wondering
a bit why
is <@!520095106888630348> still in physical pain
noted
you're still a dick sometimes
I'm glad
I'm fine
Don‚Äôt mind me
look to be real if he didn't want her to go off on him he should've a) not literally asked for it and/or b) not been a fucking ass, get off his moral high horse, and apologize when due
Nvm
But idk
I think she has the right to be salty
^
I think she has a right to be salty
i apologize for that
And I probably should not have included you in it
But i'm a little annoyed with his general assholery
Shrug
But maybe that‚Äôs how you meant it
It‚Äôs kind of nasty and mean spirited?
which line
The impression kinda crossed a line I think
I‚Äôm gonna be honest
and i've noticed he's been very quiet since he asked for it
Yikes?
oof!
Noah wanted my impression of him
are you good jane
what is happening
Rip?
Get ready to get thrown over so <@193229269076279298> can chase after Cole
That‚Äôs fair haha
Eh
Then I guess Noah doesn't find you adequate either
I am a weak bean
40
I can bench like
Lol
No
<@340319804747415553> can you bench your own body weight?
As said girlfriend, yikes indeed
Yikes
‚ÄúI have so much sex with my girlfriend‚Äù
Also L
"also <@373181327916269568> is the only one I find adequate because he can bench his own body weight"
L?
"oh look at me. I'm Noah. I'm super jacked and y'all are fucking weak. You should all be more like me. I'm a dick who likes to wake people up at 2 in the morning because fuck you. I'm so in shape and I have so much sex with my girlfriend. AND my brothers are just as jacked and hot as me. What do you losers have?"
Yes
<@193229269076279298> do you want my impression of you
They really aren't
-_-
<@193229269076279298> same thing
huh wat
I'm not being an ass
I'm telling you to acquire mass
i think you're right
<@258094439636008971> I think it's too much to ask for Noah to not be an ass
not the good kind
just
hey, i have mass
am I not allowed to be disappointed in the lack of mass in this group
^
note how he isnt an ass about it tho
<@!373181327916269568> thank you, at least someone is in shape
<@184405311681986560> could take noah in a 1v1
I used to be able to, I haven't benched anything for a while though
Is that why you're obsessed with my boyfriend
Noah shut up you're off the ark
<@!105508293522264064> can you?
<@!373181327916269568> you seem the most likely to be able to
actually can anyone here bench their body weight?
which is extremely sad
uh <@!520095106888630348> I'm pretty sure I'm the strongest person in this group
Whoever loses to Noah is a disgrace
i think we should vote cuz otherwise noah might outdo some of us
Ark
Whoever is too weak to survive will be fed to the other animals on the arm
We're going to do this hunger games style
it's now jane's ark
I vote we toss Noah out of the ark first
If the restart starts with you, I'll pass
a restart doesn't seem that bad
I mean have you looked at the people around you
yea
damn
You agreed to help drown the entire world
it's biblical?
Naming a movie or book "50 shades of grey" is equivalent to naming your child "Noah"
because damn, the title is about as bad as it can get
and why it got so many people annoyed
hey can we talk about how bad of a title "50 shades of grey" is
I'm shocked I tell you, shocked
wow I wonder who got similar results
medium attractor/moderate behaviorist/strong intimate/moderate sensualist
NVM I quit idk how to answer these questions lol
Sure
why not
it's not like I don't have time
Are we all doing this?
and here's the description but you prob got the same thing
strong attractor/moderate behaviorist/strong intimate/moderate sensualist
I accidentally closed mine but I got strong attractor / moderate sensualist / moderate behaviorist
lol yeah p much
get someone else to post too
idk what to do with em
well i did
r i p
I  D I D N ' T  G E T  R E S U L T S
are we posting results lol
reigns supreme with?
<@!503787499605458954> noah reigns supreme
lol it wont let me take it again
im assuming something didnt load
lmao it didnt give me a score
my phone didnt have a submit button, so im trying again from a laptop
h m p h
my wifi cut out after i submit
i genuinely have no idea how to answer the bulk of this, and i feel like i'm picking random answers
Lol one sec then
imo this is not as bad as the bdsm test
you've said this at least 5 times tonight already
I'm concerned
*most*
honestly most of us probably don't have enough experience to know for sure
<@!258094439636008971>
http://artofconnection.org/arousal-types/
I did find and take this
not a kink of mine, more power to you if it is tho
I don't need to defend myself
ok I just wasn't paying attention but yknow what
... sigh
no, she's just leaving things to implication
so... you're being a presumptuous ass lol
so...
well she's not defending herself
....
<@!503787499605458954> I don't judge
<@193229269076279298> "someone" meaning you?
........
someone will get off to anything
some people probably get off to it
idk
Why the hell would you tho
though I guess I'd also find it a bit funny to wear something that's been up my ass in public as a fashion statement
I'm still laughing @ the one they said you could wear as a necklace
entertaining
u h
not really what I was looking for but
.....
https://www.joe.ie/life-style/nsfw-quiz-look-at-these-pictures-and-tell-us-whether-theyre-sex-toys-or-not-511137
this is the only thing I've found so far
lmao
(kidding noah's like objectively a better person than me)
rip?
my dude I've been annoying salina for a decade he ain't got shit on me
But forcing people to take it is valid as well
Oh, mb
he just forced people to take it
...
I shared the bdsm one
Also to annoy Salina
oh
<@503787499605458954> To find nsfw quizzes and compile tea related to them
At that point, we won't really need him
what's noah's job
........... rip
Cindy's just out to prove she can do Noah's job better than him
oh boi
huh I dont know any others off the top of my head but gene you've inspired me to look for more
ok other times I just automatically think of something so violently depraved that I feel compelled to either share immediately and drag y'all down w me or at least go "fuck why must I think of these things" at which point noah will egg me on
i mean what else is there
rip
If the pulls out more nsfw quizzes, I'm interested tho
unfortunately lol
:p
usually the latter
<@193229269076279298> jk luv u
Cindy does it to entertain us and add a humorous light to an unexpected situation
Noah does it either to pry for humorous info (which can be interesting and fun) or to make us uncomfortable
I'm a believer in small doses
unlike noah I don't get off on "corrupting" you
<@!193229269076279298> which i, ahem, don't appreciate lmao
noah just lets things go full death spiral
i am in agreement
valid
ok
Just not those that involve Noah for starters
Degenerate you is fun in certain situations
in more ways than one üòâ
"fun"
degenerate me is so much more fun though
the last vestiges of forlorn hope?
anyways sadly I was a bit too slow but I'm also in support of you passing on him anyways
I like wholesome Cindy better
good question
but why
i believed in youuuuu
c i n d y D:
..............
oh before you made that last comment I was gonna say some shit about how it'd be more fun to play w other things if you get what I mean
what have i gotten myself into
rip
avoid the sandy lube
smart
bc i sure ain't gonna after this
or go smash him
go play apex legends with gabe
n o a h
.........
S t o p
lmaooo
oh sorry, I forgot he can play with toys on his own
I mean, I fucking hope not
you don't know that for sure
n o a h h h
yeesh
it's not like the lube thing will ever effect you
b e c a u s e
why?
<@193229269076279298> <@503787499605458954> the least you guys could do is limit your tainted conversations to here
Lol rip
thanks
<@!460689096646590465> is really messed up right now, @everyone be very nice
Oof!
bc i‚Äôm desperate
Of all people
Why would you invite Noah to the threesome
Emi what the fuck
oh dammmn
i am fucking fabulous
noah doesn't qualify as a man
ofc i am
ur right
:p
more like snobsplaining
mansplaining
*pretentious noah mode activated*
<@193229269076279298> Good. That's the last thing I want to be inspecting.
You will never be allowed to work in a Inspection department with your current attitude
you have a tolerance and you stick to it
As someone who has a fascination with metrology, the uncertainly is quantified, none of this uncertainty bullshit
That's because he was trying to insult you
well i mean
Gene I am insulted
<@340319804747415553> We know you're joking
sorry emi
i'm just joking but like this is going into a no go zone
<@460689096646590465> what did I do
let's close this convo rightttt here
okay
this is why we don't like you guys
lmao
e w
who said i was guessing :p
damn
<@193229269076279298> I mean, I'd assume she's mostly just guessing. Using magnifying glasses tend to make things appear a little bit blurry, so I have to assume there's a fair amount of uncertainty.
<@258094439636008971> but <@340319804747415553> is
Probably not. He can't really use his own dick.
does that include noah
per person
wait
Also, my math is perfectly fine. I don't see Noah claiming otherwise
^
the nile isn't just a river
emi
i think your math is wrong gene
i don't GET hangovers
d a m n
I don't think Noah should be a part of a threesome. Basic math suggests that there'd only be one inch of dick per person if you divide evenly.
damn, you really must be nursing that hangover
fuck you, he's mine
well my answer is the same as his
lmfao
i was inviting <@!193229269076279298> but k
no place like nsfw
no time like the present
then make em
There are so many dick jokes to be made here
so fuck you, she's mine
<@!460689096646590465> I assume you're referring to <@!340319804747415553>
I can't do it all
spread the load out
It spreads
that was a very noah joke to make
sorry sorry sorry
No complaints
*not doing anyone
Well, y'all have fun now. I'll be over here not doing that thank you very much.
damn
threesome
<@!460689096646590465> care to clarify
possibly?
hmmm
Orgy?
I am confused now
ummm ok
no this was right
I'm just going to assume this was the wrong chat
the more the merrier
feel free to join us
rip
*and we're not all around*
just ask <@!503787499605458954> when you're both not drunk next time
thanks im really single right now
well I wish you luck with Cindy
nice
wow <@!460689096646590465>
lmfao
maybe we just reject the straights
but *nooo* Salina and me can't
Jiayi and me *fine*
Jane and Salina *fine*
Cindy and Em *fine*
Salina and Cindy *fine*
for some reason -_-
but only me and Salina
because apparently me cuddling with Salina is *nsfw*
why did you put this in nsfw
<@!193229269076279298> it's because we hate you
i think its just you
I sense a double standard
Why can all you guys cuddle and nobody cares but the instant I start to cuddle with Salina *it's a problem*
Wait I just realized something
that's why the industry keeps going
i would guess so
but there are still some really amazing work being done honestly
people hate where fashion is rn *generally*
fair enough
i keep tabs on the fashion scene
uh huh
lmao overdramatic fashion hoes
but she really does do some amazing stuff
the overdramatic fashion hoes of the world are calling her the saving grace of high fashion
yeah
alright that's cool
oh wow
implementation of 3D printing and stuff
oh interesting
she does a lot of really cool material work
L
sorry who
iris van herpen's designs for her last show were really cool
sometimes i like it
sometimes i really hate fashion
welcome to fashion, folks
but also a symbol of sexuality/sensuality
damn
<@520095106888630348> the thing you really missed was some peace and quiet away from noah
the red bottoms are a tribute to the ladies of the night
Ugh, Noah's back too
but anyway
noah, be quiet lol
flexing
luxury brands
*meat*
high fashion
did i miss
what
whores walk thru the meatpacking district
that's where it came from!
lol
Color archetypes
walking thru a meatpackng district
power walk
something something
a powerful color
idk red is just like
i just love the proportions of their shoes
oh
I'm in love w the red bottom aesthetic tbh
I want a pair of louboutins
i do want a pair of shoes
actually scratch what i said about never buying luxury brands
louboutin sample sales have some really cool stuff
Usually, if you wanna flex that you have taste in games, you have to play indies, which tend to be cheaper (but can also be soooo gooooood)
you might need to punch a bitch, but the prices are generally better
bc in the long run it's often cheaper than replacing stuff every season
if you can, go to sample sales and shit
also
I'd say if you have the extra money to pay upfront buy yourself at least a few nice pieces that will last a long time
ragequit is a thing even in good games
I'm mostly kidding
gaming is great but it def falls out of favor
*some video games
i disagree with that
<@503787499605458954> video games are classy
it might last forever but there's the question of how justifiable is it
if you're gonna buy expensive stuff buy something classy
Ehhh
it depends tbh
will last you forever
good quality shit
that big gucci belt energy
that I disagree with
not the clothes only for flexing thing
I meant the spinoff thing
do it for the flex
oh I know
I feel like there's sometimes justification behind luxury items when it comes to other things (e.g. cars, house), but with clothes, I feel likes it's purely for flexing
also if you track certain styles and stuff, there's a lot of cool dupes/spinoffs in midrange fashion
lol all good
i'm sorry
working next to a gucci store left me quite jaded about buying luxury brands lol
I kinda love the versace aesthetic
idk
well ok then
rip?
Nintendo : ' )
none of them?
me?
luxury brands you would buy if you had the $$$?
anyway
it just kinda happened
why not
idk
Why are we talking about fashion in nsfw
but anyway, i'll shut up
a lot of people are actually really pissy about high fashion rn a lot of brands are being v eh both design-wise and ethically
cool shit happens
and then you have your gallianos, diors, YSLs, etc step into the scene and voila
where people are like "high fashion is dead"
esp bc it has very distinctive on and off periods
tbh haute couture fashion is really interesting
Striped white shirt
i'm disappointed
He would usually wear a white shirt under the jacket
all black or bust lol
boo
Black is the predominant color
Well, black and brown
and cole is very eh about that
the main thing i remember is that he acts like cole is his best friend
Brown and black bag
met him before but he just didn't make enough of an impression i guess
idr what this guy looks like
and is this accompanied by a black soul
is the bag black too
question
it's a solid look for him tho
lol
leather jacket + black jeans + messenger bag = nate blumenstein
of course they become impractical if you add stilettos
they're warm
insert *fashion isn't meant to be practical* joke here
also thigh-high boots
yes.
LEATHER JACKETS
messenger bags
what's a practical fashion I really like
oh wait gene's messenger bag thing
messenger bags
wait how'd we get from fashion to how I group people's brands of assholery
asshole is kind of the in-between but idk how to describe the other distinctions I make
it's a bit of a spectrum I guess
like just outright mean
rude
blunt
what about dicks?
like more likely to be nice to your face and shit talk you behind your back
more fake I guess
I know
thats ironic
like bitches are cattier
I just have had this in my head for forever
idk how
can we define these categories?
abhay sunil is a male bitch
who's a male bitch or a female dick?
not really
is that organized by gender?
^
dick
bitch
what are the other classes?
but I'm not that dickish
w some bitchy traits
I fall pretty strongly into the "asshole" category
*main classes
between the 3 classes of shitty people
there are distinctions
you're right
hm
you're not a dick tho
*objection*
I'm enjoyable and lovable in more ways than one if you get what I mean
ehhhh
I am tho üòÉ
but noah is not an example of that
i will say, just cuz someone can be a dick towards others doesnt mean that they can't be overall enjoyable and loveable and even nice people
nah, no worries
oof my b
that's what i thought too
oh
this is what i thought you were talking about <@!520095106888630348>
oh
fuck fashion if need be
you wear what you want to wear Gene
<@!520095106888630348> ouch
they're still my friends, and they're wonderful people, but they're dicks nonetheless
@noah
we gotta get Gene a messenger bag
.........@phillip wang
damn
LMFAO
like today lol
i will note, everyone who i've ever met that carries a messenger bag is kinda a dick tho
i've made fun of him for it already
yeah he knows
hahaha
it is objectively untrue
do not tell him that
you're super fashionable, bitch
<@!193229269076279298> you hear that?
messenger bags are lowkey super fashionable
tbh, i'd totally carry a messenger bag, but it's too much work, and i'd rather just wear pants with large pockets and carry things in my arms
can't fit that in most womens pockets if I have any
like even if I'm only bringing a wallet
assuming you don't actually have much to carry
not a necessity 80% of the time
bags should be an optional accessory
lol
"shit, i forgot my pants"
and you're like
sometimes you just walk out of your house
if you would rather carry a bag that's fine but i want the options
for example
<@!503787499605458954> i mean, while pockets help, they dont completely solve the bag-forgetting problem
^^
_give us pockets_
pros and cons
i'm fine with either tbh
see: me forgetting bag today
I'd rather have pockets than have to carry a bag
rip
THE FACT THAT THEY PUT FAKE ONES ON WOMEN'S JEANS IS THE BANE OF MY EXISTENCE
besides
but cool bags are cool
POCKETS
eh
yeah, but having pockets is like a basic human right
fashion isn't always impractical
<@!258094439636008971> it's a ploy to get women to be helpless
change your life
touch the fashion
fashion, darling
bc
wear this to something you need to look cute at but won't be moving much at
why is fashion so impractical
so like
it's weird to raise your arms above a certain height
I mean it doesnt look like it would matter much but it's just kinda awkward around your shoulders
this kind also like
https://www.pinterest.com/pin/AaR3Jy1ioyDBazpqdF9CvQN9Fvd8eibFCSSfUo5hhRgm2QwjwcS7T9A/
i've never understood how those work
i can see how those are annoying
*too
if it's stretchy it'll pop back up if you move to vigorously
ok i have a shirt like the one i sent in
like this
https://www.pinterest.com/pin/140807925829962459/
like this?
oh wait
that's only like super low isn't it?
but they look damn good
they restrict your arm movements
they can be kinda annoying to wear tbh
I don't own any but _nice_
ok off-shoulder tops are _really nice_
my fave trends:
-bell sleeves
-super distressed denim
-crushed velvet
-camo
-off-shoulder tops/dresses
-bomber jackets
-faux fur
-bodysuits (big fan of the sheer lacy ones tbh)
-high-slit skirts
-clear heels
-lace-up everything
-CROP TOPS
-JOGGERS
-S A T I N
I used to wear more jewelry and then i got too lazy to put any on
but I'm a magpie
I like don't actually wear it that often
I have too much jewelry
I just think they look pretty
I don't think he's talking about chokers for himself
I don't have any chokers
your fashion sense aligned w his taste
I'm a lil concerned now that my fashion sense has aligned with Noah's
you have to change your opinion now
Noah agrees with me???
I agree
chokers are pretty
improved
but like
90s nostalgia
they're back
or did they ever leave
are chokers back
it's raining like heck
@ anyone who's interested
favorite fashion trends of recent years?
it ain't ending for a while
have you looked outside?
i almost don't want winter to end
_i love sweaters_
I have a sweater addiction
same
I _love_ womens' winter fashion
MM
https://www.pinterest.com/cindy_wang2001/fashion/
oooh can i see
I have a board for womens fashion
aw that's a shame
but he showed me a few times
I don't have it saved
can i see the pinterest board
i could look decently dressed if i cared to give a shit, but i dont
anyways he kept/keeps a pinterest board for mens fashion lmfao
awesome dude
he got me onto a p big congressional campaign team last summer
great speaker, great guy
one of the greats from JSA"s golden age
Sunny Malhotra
who?
good dude
lol
YES
who's a very well-dressed guy
sunny?
I just remembered someone I know
OH
possibly yea
I feel like I have way more female celebrity crushes lmao
Heidi Klum is a beautiful woman
yeah but also like streetwear-wise
<@!340319804747415553> did you finally stop spamming the other chat?
i mean they get styled right?
but idk names
have better fashion sense than like actors
tbh I feel like a lot of models
a lot of kpop stars
rdj either looks like perfection or utter trash clothes-wise but he gives 0 fucks so
‚ÄúMaybe‚Äù lol
maybe david beckham
george clooney
ryan gosling
or a celebrity if you're struggling
damn good question
that I know personally?
that is a guy
who has a good sense of style
(but that's harder to achieve)
(also abs)
good sense of style is p much the single most attractive thing you can do as a guy tbh
hmmmmmmm
oh I just realized I never answered my own question
savoring our misery would be like sending us a video
:D
why must you savor our misery
Muahaha
I‚Äôll save myself thanks
BEGONE
intrusive thoughts
And I‚Äôm a good Christian girl

until you just said that
imagine it
actually
i deleted her message for her
ok I didn't
*image
<@!340319804747415553> that's preferable to this
don't want the imagine of Noah and Salina fucking in my brain
Drink it too
pls bleach
So pure
my pure christian eyeballs
i resent this
You ain‚Äôt wrong :p
Lmfao
but noah does
false
You wish u could
;)
<@!340319804747415553> fuck you
that's unreasonably low
i'm not mad just disappointed
out of like 10k messages
in this server
19 times
damn I've only said fuck you
:D
boooooo
No regrets
???
Yw :)
Oh
W h a t
you fucked up the alphabet
what the fuck
also
Eh
Overall
And don‚Äôt be too bent out of shape
Have some nice eyes
Like
I don‚Äôt really have that much of a physical type
she's the opposite of me:
she likes people who go to the gym for dates
Oh
she does?
I know you kinda have a personality type
hey salina do you have a physical type
Uh hi
and when done poorly oboe sounds like utter trash
the few make up for the many
Percussionists
but they're so rare
a good oboe is actually p fucking nice
oboe
least attractive common instrument?
lmao no
I am one
right
*asshole pianists
oh I've met tons
i've met more asshole sax players
sigh
i've met some asshole piano players tho
üòâ
ayyy i see what you did there
Piano is p sexy too
hands down
piano is the sexiest instrument
his saxophone tone is attractive
<@!503787499605458954> why are you biased?
his tone is like
like heavily
I'm biased though
i have
HOLY SHIT, HAVE YOU GUYS EVER HEARD SIMON BREEDLOVE PLAY SAX
guys who can sing are really hot
guys who can sing!!
WHICH BY THE WAY
voice counts
<@!503787499605458954> in that case, i've met about 3 people who can make a saxophone sound attractive
<@!503787499605458954> does voice count
and I think sax is p nice
I was asking like, the ability to play which instrument is most attractive in it of itself
i know enough to know we're a bunch of fucking nerds
it's not about the person actually being attractive
...aren't you a sax player
i've met like 4 attractive saxophone players in my lifetime
also, contrary to popular belief, saxophone is not an attractive instrument
again, we're a bunch of dipshits
fuck band
*sexy sax music plays in background*
does voice count
what's the most attractive instrument to play
i like how old middle school rivalries like to flare up years down the road
but I maintain that band is far superior to orchestra
lol I'm not even in band anymore and haven't been in 4 years
i mean, band is full of dipshits, so i'm not disagreeing with you there
if the price is high enough
wow fuck you
because fuck band
i think everyone i've liked up until Cole was an orchestra kid
oh yea
no, i'm saying you've mentioned that <@!520095106888630348>
is that your type Gene?
if i may comment, musically inclined, but specifically orchestra and choir kiddos
all fairly relaxed people
they've all been fucking nerds
yeah sure
i don't like actively look for things but i've noticed trends if that's what you want
i wish to convert him to being normal
F
yea
my type?
<@!258094439636008971> maybe stop pursuing noah then
and cindy what?
I'm so curious
<@!520095106888630348> ?
that person knows what's up
i tweeted ‚Äúi like men‚Äù and somebody replied to me saying ‚Äúi‚Äôm so sorry‚Äù
smh
also, to answer your question <@!503787499605458954> 
my type is people who are normal enough to not go to a gym for a date
this is getting too meta lmao I'll stop talking about what I've already said
I know, I mentioned that
you've also said that before <@!503787499605458954>
short girls
oh I said that twice oops
oh god
just in general
I think I've said this before but I think in general girls are more aesthetically attractive than guys
<@!460689096646590465> don't you have a type for girls too
type in girls?
oh yeah i wanna know
what's your type as well
any guys who are lurking here
oh I didn't mean to exclude anyone
fit but not a dorito
lmaoo
like we get it you‚Äôre made of testosterone
that‚Äôs too much
not a dorito? why
not a dorito
<@!460689096646590465> that explains a lot actually
good hair good style
lol
I don't know. He goes to like this woodsy summer camp thing in Vermont or somewhere where they like live off nature and learn to be MEN or something
feminine and has a skin care routine
wait ok girls what's your type
is he a jungle boy what
but it works
stick/string is not super efficient
hiking is great
hiking is good
wow I love that
at the tkd competition Cole saw him from across the room and went " my _boy"_ in the highest pitched voice i've ever heard him use
keep in mind that Cole sees him through rose tinted glasses
ngl
he sounds attractive
probably
i can do that
sure!
<@!503787499605458954> do you wanna swim together then
<@!460689096646590465> im like p sure that Cole is love with Andrew too so you might have competition but
like idk how to use any of the machines
I also used to go to a climbing gym but that was almost purely for climbing
yea I used to do swim but I've only ever been to the pool areas
<@!258094439636008971> i've done that too
i've been to the y for swim practice
why cant you people be normal and have dates that have you do things that make you gain weight like watch movies or eating lunch together
we'll be dumb together
so
hey I've never been to an actual gym in my life
lmao i'm gonna look so dumb
I'm down if you're down
was that an actual plan
<@!340319804747415553> <@!193229269076279298>
wasn't the plan for them to take me and jane on a double date at the Y
next time you third-wheel noah and salina, do it during their gym dates
like I can feel it it is very sad
since school started tho
lol I've lost muscle
i like cindy‚Äôs idea
^
porque no los dos
why have abs when you can have food
yeah i actually met him at one of his tkd competitions
o k
o h
he does taekwondo
that changes a lot
he has abs
<@!460689096646590465>
<@!520095106888630348> there is both no supply and no demand
idk name a price
<@!258094439636008971> would you strip
i‚Äôm unemployed
god how much
true
You would have to pay Emily to watch Noah strip
don't really know how
as of right now
<@!193229269076279298> too, but for a large sum of money
ok but
as has <@!340319804747415553> i think
<@!503787499605458954> has expressed a willingness to strip in the past
the world is brutal
sucks
he's too innocent for this line of work
he‚Äôs out
okay nvm
<@!460689096646590465> so Cole asked Andrew if he'd come and strip for you and he's v confused and laughing awkwardly
<@!373181327916269568> is andrew free tonight
i'm on it
yeah do that
oh
<@!520095106888630348> get andrew
well who else do i got
yeah actual worst choice
that's not sexy
Why would you get Noah as the stripper
Also, <@460689096646590465> is everything ok?
<@193229269076279298> your services are required
Don't worry, I'm on it
call a stripper for you?
do i need to like
both
are you sad or horny or both
let‚Äôs play a game called am i sad or horny or both
I'll go see if Nic or Bethany will take my cardboard box, cuz idk what to do with this now
Well
Oof
I looked it up
No
do you know what a reserve is in bidding?
What's that mean?
hence the reserve
So I win
No one else will offer you anything
I offer you a cardboard box with wheels drawn on it
also no posted reserve
well if I'm on the open market now then let the bidding commence
<@193229269076279298> see? This is how we assert dominance
Lmao
all yours
he's yours
yea
And Noah is now dating me, right? ;)
<@!340319804747415553> you suggested it not me
i like my dignity
Nic's dating a junior and Bethany is single as far as I'm aware
nah noah
<@!340319804747415553> I'm down
well then
They hate each other
that would be funny
lol
that'd go well
aggressively make out in front of them
lol, no
No
wait are nic and bethany dating??
<@193229269076279298> well, it'll be more of a flex if you date me the next time we hang out with Nic and Bethany. Assert dominance over them.
no that's him trying to organize
lol
I thought you were responding to gene slidin into your dms
yes
oh you were responding to the negative laptop comment
i'm really fucking bored
my reply was with respect to <@!340319804747415553>
jk
this fine piece of ass ;)
no we're talking about what <@!340319804747415553> gives me and what <@!258094439636008971> could give me
they do smash a lot
Oh lol
though also maybe gabe's idk
yours
Gabe's?
<@!193229269076279298> no you're also getting his dick
a kindred spirit
ah
"gabe wants a relationship about as much as cindy does"
to quote
oh
yea cause that's *all* I'm receiving <@!258094439636008971>
why was I mentioned
do not wanna scroll
I
damn
Also <@193229269076279298> keep checking them dms we ain't finished here
It's more than dating Salina and receiving negative one laptops
I can draw some wheels on a box
exactly what I was thinking
yeaaaa
Actually, don't answer that. It's just gonna be a car if you do.
<@193229269076279298> depends. What do you want?
what do you have to offer
hmm
<@193229269076279298> then date me you son of a bitch ;)
<@!258094439636008971> if I was dating you I'd be a different story
:)
<@193229269076279298> Piece of shit lol
i'm special
on occasion
:)
maybe once and a while
sometimes
then possibly
No
are you <@!340319804747415553>?
hmm
Ok, what about Discord dms <@193229269076279298>
sometimes
so yes
BC texts me when school is canceled
hmm
<@193229269076279298> do you ever check your texts?
bye janeeee <3
Bye <@520095106888630348>
üëã
She'll roast the hell out of you
Dude, we need to drag Bethany into this Discord one of these days
when i say half nice things about Noah it means i spent too much time talking to him
True
and that goes to Bethany
it's snowing outside and i want go out in it so i'm going
you only get one 11/10
Bethany is 11/10 with sarcasm
Although Bethany is 12/10 with sarcasm
okay well
no
I love that guy
Nic is 11/10 with sarcasm tho
<@520095106888630348> Nic leans more towards funny as fuck and Noah leans more towards annoying as fuck. They're different flavors of each other in that sense.
did you just say positive thing about me?
<@!520095106888630348> are you implying I can be funny?
damn jane
it varies
so like you
Nic can be annoying as fuck or funny as fuck
Nic is a dumbbutt who needs to stop eating pasta
seems like quite the character
Nic is interesting
*dramatic music plays*
not well but i know of her
But how well do you really?
i know Bethany kinda
<@193229269076279298> we need to introduce her to Nic and Bethany
yeah sophomore me would've hated Noah
But you see what I mean, right?
yes
I don't think I'd get along with Gabe, from what i can tell
*sometimes*
I sometimes get along with Noah
One of those friends was Noah
so sorry
Well
i am
lmao rip jane
<@520095106888630348> I remember sometime our sophomore or junior year, I was like, "hahaha you should meet my other friends" and then paused and thought, "wait, no, you wouldn't get along with them"
Nicholas is also great in his own ways
i think it's time for me to go
Gabe also wants a relationship about as much as <@!503787499605458954> does
nah
so
they're from the same family Salina
and i don't really know what nicholas is like
what, doesn't have enough money?
not my type
but eh
gabe's chill and fun to talk to
Gabe is great
nah
?????
jfc
The only reason why Salina is willing to let go of Noah and give him to me is because it frees her up to date Gabe
but then again if i had the choice i wouldn't have met you either
he cuts through a lot of bullshit most people put out
I very much don't ever want to meet your brother
these are wildly conflicting accounts
yep
well that's the point, he's honest and upfront
mmh
`Gabe could care less about you`
`oh gabe's great
he's hilarious
bless his soul`
Lovely
he doesn't like most people
it's specific to each person
it's not because he doesn't like people
he doesn't like you for **you**
i don't understand how he can be that but also hilarious
but everything is personal
Gabe could care less about you
because if there was a formatting to describe turning your nose up at people I would have used that
makes sense bc herc is gabe's
HE CORRUPTED THE DOG TOO?!
well
gabe is like herc
why is other people italicized
Gabe has very little care for *other people*
you do that anyway
Gabe will roast you
jk
gabe's good for frying
i assume gabe is also good for roasting
noah is good for roasting
like what
But not the ones we care about
Some similarities
Well
rip?
He's not wrong
*doubt
Gabe is really nothing like me as far as you guys are concerned
<@340319804747415553> since when did we trust your taste in Righis?
bless his soul
he's hilarious
oh gabe's great
Yeah, I did
so it wasn't noah for once
i assume gabe is about a delightful as you are
also gene brought up gabe
we're talking about Gabe not me
like what?
why are you like this
lol
Gabe tunes everyone out, take it personally
<@520095106888630348> again, it's not worth an antibiotic apocalypse
<@193229269076279298> I was talking to your brother about Chinese food, and he turned me out until I brought up one dish that I described as "it's like bacon but..."
idk i've never had bacon
it's very eh
when not
when cooked properly
bacon is amazing
It's p good, but it's not worth an antibiotic apocalypse
ok is bacon even that good
<@520095106888630348> nah, let's shove them in pig feed to make the pigs grow bigger even tho there's no scientifically proven correlation, so we can burn through society's antibiotic supply faster
Let's use antibiotics on viruses <@!258094439636008971>
I've seen worse uses of antibiotics
do you want the poison then
antibiotics don't work on vermin
vermin?
maybe we do need antibiotics to get rid of this vermin
geez he's working his way through the group corrupting everyone
<@520095106888630348> Noah is mine now
what is happening
rip?
I did not start this
I wish to point out <@!340319804747415553> made this conversation about me specifically
Extra y added for demonstrated flirtatious intent
Oh wait, I did that wrong
<@193229269076279298> heyy
Sweet
he's all yours
gene
k bye then :p
don't waste them on things that will adapt
then stop wasting my time :p
how else do you get rid of disease then
^
S T O P  W A S T I N G  A N T I B I O T I C S
you don't "hang out"
we're not "soaking" it
a round of antibiotics should take care of it <@!340319804747415553>
<@340319804747415553> sure, I'll take him
can i get rid of noah then
hi
.........................
generally men like to hang out in the vagina
well
<@520095106888630348> I mean stuff that doesn't normally hang out in a vagina
it just means it's well suited to not getting infected
Like stuff that isn't already there
bacteria is foreign life, it's not you
it doesn't mean it can't
I think he means foreign life
I'm saying it's designed so it doesn't get infected
:p
shut up noah, the bio people are talking
I know that
and yeast infections are a thing
there's a lot of stuff in there
^
microbiomes
that's the point of the pH value
<@!193229269076279298> false
uh the vagina is rather inhospitable to most forms of life
<@520095106888630348> it won't clean that easily
then it would be a perfectly comfortable dildo while still being a pringles can
<@!193229269076279298> the vagina
ok but if we crush it down to a comfortable size, clean it and lubricate it
an infection of what?
At this point, this is way more expensive than a normal dildo
No amount of lubrication will prevent an infection
Uh, put a condom on the refurbished Pringles can and then lubricate it I guess
yes but this is a hypothetical situation where someone is turned on by pringles cans
Just because you can doesn't mean you should
can you lubricate the pringles can
Unless you put a condom on it I guess? But like, still don't??
Don't make dildos out of refurbished Pringles cans
This sounds like a great way to introduce something to somewhere it will cause problems
like if you recycle something it's no longer what it was
Why would you stick that in anything
ok but is it still a pringles can then?
Why
But like
<@520095106888630348> you can probably melt it
and form it into a dildo-like shape
can you crush the pringles can
Sometimes I feel like I need Nic and Bethany here to shut you up
Dude, you were the one who asked
well what counts as "stretchy"
Noah, no
or is it both?
<@340319804747415553> that won't stop some people
is your mouth stretchy or can you can you just train your jaw to open more
If that was your next question
the external sphincter generally doesn't want to expand to that size
You can't deepthroat a Pringles can
i would like to interject
No, Noah
er
question
rip
<@520095106888630348> I said I didn't want to test it
um have you seen the edges on a pringles can
I still don't know if that's well
DON'T put a pringles can up your butt Gene
"well"
then there you go, both genders can fuck a pringles can well
I'm not sure, and I don't want to test it
Probably
yes
is an asshole stretchy enough to fit a pringles can in
<@!520095106888630348> what are your other questions
anyway
Because that means someone paid to have this song made
it's not a joke song, good money was paid for this to be created
Not much
Paid*
how much better would you feel to know someone was paid to make this song
^^^^^^
B i g  d i s t u r b
far too catchy for its own good
No, it's not
it's a good song though
I hate you <@193229269076279298>
your welcome <@!258094439636008971>
wtf?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2dJ-JUzhVs
Serious
I can't grab Pringles out of a can with hands or a penis. I can't eat the product in any way whatsoever.
<@193229269076279298> if you make me listen to that song again, you're dead
I have no body part I can use to grab those Pringles
and skinny hands
pringles
horse cock
What IS supposed to fit in there?
^
Too small for hands and too big for penises
abrasive and it's salt
Who the hell designed the Pringles can?
Oh dear god
also think of the salt
<@193229269076279298> but the typo was a puuunnnn
then you're not fucking the pringles can you're just being weird
Nice typo
see `neither can do it well`
correct
there is no way that a male penis is the right size to fit snugly inside a pringles can
also
salina is death now?
Mmmm
bc he's a sap
<@193229269076279298> why are you like this?
Oh, I have one
I only have all day
<@!520095106888630348> come on get the questions rolling
You could play me in Smash
rip
I have nothing better to do while falling into the sweet embrace of ~~Salina~~ death
Oh dear
then ask them
Oops, sorry, guys. I kinda crashed during this conversation
i  give up
I feel like this is my call to action to do the opposite
more
leave
and Salina will be taking a day off from school
mainly because I'll be dead in a ditch somewhere
you guys will know if I'm not leaving things up to your imagination
thank u
leave something up to the imagination
just stop
I'm sure they're bad don't get me wrong
noah i beg you
you're doing it rn
and you guys think I hype up our DMs
^
just cringey as hell
this isn't quite nauseating
don't ruin her ENTIRE life
noah let her have some peace in her life
maybe I just like seeing everyone else throwing up
:(

i really don't like her
Her name has "tea" in it
lol rip

she'd have to get paid back eventually
I always thought her name was shusta
i'm not sure there are regulations on that
ciustea
Who is this??
u prob right
yeah
Still tho
but like she was fuming
katya didn't do it
oh
<@!520095106888630348> bluntly and without consideration
I feel like that breaks some ISD regulations
we are annoyed
how do you ask a teenager to pay for 10 hotel rooms
so
yeah
What
You can't like
WOAH WHAT
science
which is like wtf?!?
and she told katya to pay for 10 hotel rooms on her own credit card
What club?

I'm sorry
riperoni

business and physics ias are due fri
But I feel like I expected all of next week off so much that I can't focus on reality anymore
<@!340319804747415553> night love
And the snow
Prolly cuz the EE being done
yes
Does anyone else feel like it's break?
sleep well
Oof I'm sorry. Good luck.
macbeth doth murder the innocent sleep, but my parents will murder the innocent me if i don't sleep
G'night
anyhow, i actually gotta go sleep
I sure won't lol
it's really interesting actually
... provided it lives long enough
an ant that walks on an increasingly stretched cord will eventually make it to the end
BUT
no u
we are all just ants who have a tiny blip of life in the span of time
appropriate meme usage
*Salina has left the chat*
knowing that i don't matter
exit the chat now
i will
good to know
yeesh
you people still will not though
<@193229269076279298> me not mattering is still more than you thanks to negative numbers
if I invent hypersonic missiles I will matter
apologize, bitch
ok
ok
ok
N O A H
^
none of us do
that is NOT true
intention can be taken into account but ultimately
damn noah
you do not matter <@!258094439636008971>
impact
I matter more
hmmm
Me
intention or impact
Unsurprised
at least we're in nsfw
what matters more
but where my mind went
rip?
Not where I was going
`It works for some Pokemon evolutions`
Pokemon sex, the start of furrys
I need that picture of the guy drinking a cup of tea with his foot now
I am intellectual
the intellectual side
that was like
lmfao
lol
lmao i forgot
It works for some Pokemon evolutions
oh this was about the joke
oh wait
do I need to continue
that they copulate furiously to try and fuse together
the reason people have sex is they want so badly to be one person again
yeah
remember that myth about how people used to be connected to their soulmates and then got ripped apart by the gods and that's why we have genders or whatever
She could go TOK with it or something
Yeah, true
idk, depends on how deep she feels like going
it's going to take 15 minutes to explain it?
explain the joke
work it
well you have your 15 mins of fame
Try us?
tbh
idk if it actually would make sense to anyone else
Subtle humor is subtle I suppose
i don't get it either
now I rarely do
about every third joke I'd have to stop and explain it
<@503787499605458954> wait I don't get it explain
<@!340319804747415553> remember how much I used to have to do that
I haven't seen that notation in a while
Still don't get it
damn
`no u`
`you need the other half`
wait sexual about what
ofc noah wants to
I know you do
I prolly don't tho
<@!503787499605458954> I wanna hear it
I confuse
What
so like yall prob don't wanna hear it
but in a sexual way
it made sense to me
this isn't making sense
rip?
no u
he said thank so i said welc
you need the other half
bc
Then why ping me boi <@340319804747415553>
i know we're in NSFW but DON"T
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<@!193229269076279298> I don't want to HEAR about _work_ you do on Salina
here it is
@jane i think you dropped half your word
<@!258094439636008971>  ome
....
<@!258094439636008971> welc
I do lots of work on her
everybody put your hands up
My idea tbh
<@!340319804747415553> is a work in progress degenerate
so like
this group was renamed `wholesome degenerates`
<@520095106888630348> thank
i acknowledge that
our dm's can get hella bad
he's right tho
i blame noah
u
me
Who a degenerate
i'm glad u know your numbers cindy
I'm proud
idc
I just wasn't paying attention tho lmao
you stole my one (1) job
i think you expect Cindy to be more degenerate than she is
why are u complaining
problem solved
voila
and then i did both
acting all offended
I expected <@!503787499605458954> to swoop in and say it then you to give a face about it
:P
I just expected better
I know I did
not me
you picked the wording
hey
-_-
you sure that's not just one part
the package hmm
you objectify a person's whole body
not just one part
you gotta look at the package
We get it Noah
and abs
and legs
Lemme find the meme
Yeah
and chest
does he have a lot?
I mean, it's not Christian Bale levels of change
n o a h
and traps
-.-
lmao
and back
like arms
that's horrifying
smoller
hey there is a lot more to a person than their face
YES
just
still robert downey jr
that was _Robert Downey Jr?!_
don't notice?
Cindy who is this person
still hot now
i just
shrug
like you like their face
i don't care about the star shine of celebrity of whatever
ok but aesthetic crush
hELLO young rdj I see u
I say that only somewhat ironically
on the virtue that i don't think i'd ever get to know them or that they would ever give a flying fuck that i exist
I feel like <@193229269076279298> this RDJ is attractive solely cuz the "air" around him suggests someone who would work on cars with him
but
i acknowledge that they are v talented
ok hang on I have pics now
they do cool things
I never said she couldn't
cool
like
I do not
<@!193229269076279298> you keep her from dating me so i hate you
don't care
i just
yeah i'm with you <@!340319804747415553>
i don't have any celeb crushes
eh
tbh
I do not control <@!340319804747415553> is the slightest
eh
jane and cole being triggered about hugh jackman in the greatest showman last year
but no shade
"be careful who you call ugly in middle school"
if Noah lets you do that
<@!340319804747415553> tell us who you're attracted to
i remember
ok BUT
i'm late
hi
he really is tho
there is a reason people say he makes a perfect Tony Stark
it's the "air" around him
he's alright
no shit that man is attractive
big facts
That's what money do
Robert Downey Jr can get whatever he wants
also this is a recent one but gemma chan is so fucking attractive I cannot
he's like 35 years older than me or something but robert downey jr could Get It tbh
I like how Jane's the only one who unironically answered the question
<@!503787499605458954> who do you have a celebrity crush on?
LMAO
<@520095106888630348> I just saw "singing" and "cowboy hat" and thought, "he's the yodeling Walmart kid?"
Hahaha understandable
i can barely hear how good he is over the sounds of sobbing
he's meh
Yea I remember that
men get everything handed to them
he sent his agent a video of him in a cowboy hat singing just to show that he liked to sing and they sent the video to the casting people at Les Mis
he's aight
i feel like i watched an interview with him about how he got that job
There you can decide
he wants her to be more jacked
maybe because that's why they go to the gym together
https://youtu.be/qjjB1pUDAMY
LOL
<@340319804747415553> he thinks you're a Huge Jacked Man
<@!340319804747415553> Noah has a confession for you
<@193229269076279298> we know you like Nicholas
we been knew
thanks
I love Huge Jacked Man
_I will defend this until my dying day_
_Hugh Jackman is not good_
He's better than Hugh Jackman
he does sing
can't remember if he sings well tho
Right? Love eddie redmayne
And he sings
he's cute
Yea him
yeaaaaa
ooooooooooo
That's a name
What about newt
OH Eddie Redmayne
you're only into the Rugged Mountain Men
right I remember that
I don't know you like more feminine guys than me
i don't keep up with him so idk
Haha ok
Cole Sprouse is okay
oh
One of the Sprouse's right?
<@503787499605458954> Danny DeVito
Oh wait
<@!373181327916269568> who do i have a celebrity crush on again
I don't pay attention to enough celebrities for this
but i'm absolutely sure i have them
i'm suddenly blanking
Duh
Me
celebrity crushes?
I talked to salina about it a bit at wintercon
I like random
but I was just thinking of it
ok this is random
I don't particularly care either way
do you want to see another one
Precisely why I feel murderous right now
Which hurts me even more
she got a lot of money for it
i mean
Cuz you have to be a very particular kinda of stupid to write something that cringy and not realize it after many rounds of editing
you wanted to murder Sarah J Maas
No, I just cringed
i feel like that scene scarred Gene beyond belief
we moved here after the sex scene
Why is this in nsfw?
The boi was still playing 4D chess back in those days
You can't beat Albert, even in 4th grade
Mainly cuz Albert
Also, I lost all the wars
5th too
what a time
4th grade
Over our websites
We held fake wars
We all did
emi told me you ran a website
That one chubby Asian kid on the playground never forgets
I can expose so many people who had horse phases in elementary school
hoo boy hell yeah I did
wait Cindy had a scary horse phase?
and figure out how to put them both on chains for them to wear
Five-year-old me was also pretty terrifying though, so I'm not in a position to say anything though.
<@!193229269076279298> you would have to cut it in half
Oh, I know. I was there.
5 year old me was terrifying
I wouldn't even blame you
hoooonestly
Jkjk
LOL
<@503787499605458954> horse phase scared me away in 1st grade and I just never forgot
also I've known you forever but we like weren't friends until this year
<@193229269076279298> sums up my life
yea
Are people still considered long-lost twins if they've known each other for a long time but just didn't know it?
I will get you two the gaudiest fucking locket I can find but you have to wear it then
Jkjk
Actually...
lmfao
B i g  c o n f u s e
i feel like you guys should both have like one half of a locket or something
you can see it in the hair
omg Cindy and Gene are long lost twins
üëÄ
<@503787499605458954> like, we've been asked that so many times in different levels of school, but us immediately thinking the same thing there made me think we might secretly just be wrong about the whole thing and separated at birth or something
we've seen a glimpse of the sappy side and we don't want any more
therefor you're all on the same page
you've all been exposed to one side of me
i think we all have been exposed to noah enough to be on the same side
62k
crap this group has passed us
I like how me gene and jane are just on the same wavelength when it comes to this shit
<@503787499605458954> are we sure we're not actually secretly twins?
Too many
too fucking many
idk how many pages is 55k?
but yea esp considering there's just so much more content
I'll give both of you a pass
And hell yeah, way worse. Yes, he's overhyping himself, but he's also not wrong.
bc I feel like he just likes hyping himself up
<@520095106888630348> It would be better written despite every other word being spelled wrong
I'm hesitant
yes
gene do you think his DMs would be weirder than the sex scene you just read
But I can
Maybe not specifically
So I can imagine
Well, I understand that you're a degenerate and dms with someone you're dating is probably gonna be way more degenerate
but Gabe is also aware of many things you aren't
Gabe knows what to expect
well you don't
<@193229269076279298> I would like to think I know you well enough to have an idea of what to expect
i don't want to have to bleach my brain by seeing anything worse
but whatever
some lowkey cringe screenshots
you think that's anything
lol
she sent some screenshots into the chat
no you haven't
I don't blame you for being correct <@520095106888630348>
i've seen your messages to Salina
see my DMs
lol you think this stuff is bad
sorry Gene
oh wait
OK BUT TEA
Jane beat me to it
your messages <@!193229269076279298>
good question
ohh man
what is the worst thing you've read?
but eh
yeah Cindy don't write about people bursting into flames while fucking
it was scarring
nto even close
actuallyyknow what
I wasn't give that luxury
It'd probably score lower on the "the fuck" scale despite being way weirder because Cindy doesn't write like a degenerate
close
ok it wasn't the worst thing ever
smarter than <@!340319804747415553> and <@!503787499605458954>
smart
just by virtue of her being someone i know
i don't think I'd want to read Cindy's sex scene if she wrote one
lol
well it is why you have that name
thank u
It's a lot of cringe mixed with a little bit of weird
not <@!503787499605458954>
I would like to clarify that this is not me
nothing too special
I should pull out Cindy's writing
it's just some 30 year old white lady's poorly-written supernatural sexual fantasy
It's not the weirdness. It's the badness.
that is nothing
yeah that's not too weird Gene
you need to experience more internet
that's p low on my scale tbh
Hm?
that scores 5/6 for you?
wait
wait
Also, thank you
wait
Came very close to a full 6/6 tho
That scored a 5/6 on the "the fuck" scale
Pennsylvania
What the fuck did I just read
Who the fuck has time to write this
Why the fuck would you write this
How did the fuck did this not get edited more
Where the fuck is the author so I can stab them
L
.
I
.
Rip?
"Bite you all over" flirting
no it was them flirting
at least there was foreplay?
Iconic phrase for all the wrong reasons
well
‚ÄúVelvet wrapped steel‚Äù
with build up for THREE
Ah
this goes on for SIX PAGES
oh man
the cringe
Nice to know she's setting completely realistic expectations for women
yea she's on fire
Sounds hot
bursting into flames
i found the one we were talking about
"jane is typing..."
uh rip
No you're totally fine
<@!520095106888630348> i'm sorry. is there anything i can do? i probably shouldn't have said that.
Not that. <@193229269076279298> makes me uncomfortable
good luck with your essays
ok, cya
I gotta go
are we thinking of the same event?
stop using acronyms that the audience isn't familiar with thank you very much
It's literally a 10 min CAD job and then send it to the printer
how tf did you 3d print chocolate?
it was chocolate tho
Uh I have no clue what your talking about I always have ABS and have had a 3d printer for years
he doin' the big explain cuz i always explain thing in the worst possible way to make him look bad
I don't know how to react to this
i believe so
....did he have to get a mold?
<@!520095106888630348> not only that, he spent three weeks making it cuz he went out of his way to get the equipment
cuz if you won't i'll keep making this weirder
<@!193229269076279298> you wanna explain it?
Wtf
......
noah has historically proven to give people chocolate dildos on their birthdays, so i respect if that's something you don't wanna receive in mail
i've kept it ambiguous enough that he won't get it
You may as well just tell him my birthday at this point you've pretty much given me away
Gene
<@!193229269076279298> tell jane to respect her elders for me please thank you very much
Except noah
Respect your elders Gene
we love you dumb butts tho
Also
Yeah
<@!520095106888630348> y'all are old fucks

<@!520095106888630348> (hey, i'm trying to get you something for your birthday in a couple months. can i get your social security number so i can sign you up for this service i'm getting you?)
what? what do you mean?
Gene stop stealing my identity
yeah, but like it was several months apart, since i was born in november
Across the country from y'all lmao
I was born
Fun fact
Salina and Gene were born in the same hospital room
i had to think and then i think i choked a bit
for "reasons"
I only know Salina's birthday
my birthday is november, man
does Gene really expect me to know his birthday?
dude, no it's not
Mar 29, 2001
That's Gene's birthday
I'm not turning 19
If you end up with your identity stolen don't come crying to me <@373181327916269568>
damn
<@!520095106888630348> you're turning 19 really?
his is the 2000, 16th
also only one day older than <@!261949028994908170>
You didn't tell me not to
also you're only 10 days older than me
there is a list of birthdays in the planning chat
Cole you fool
<@!193229269076279298> she's turning 19 this year
Why
August 15th 2000
<@258094439636008971> stranger danger, I'm not giving my birthday to him
also if <@!520095106888630348> birthday is march 29th she's 17
everything

the guy
J E R E M Y
you have called upon the wrath of Jeremy Gunawan's list
<@!193229269076279298> being totally serious tho, jane's birthday is march 29
Why do we want birthdays in a list?
<@!520095106888630348> wow, way to blow my cover
jane's birthday is october 14
I said don't tell him, not lie to him
2000 I take it?
Gene what?

Wgy

I'll add it to the list
Nobody tell him
<@!373181327916269568> when is your birthday
<@!520095106888630348> when is your birthday?
S H H H H H H
I'm 18
s h h h h h
It happens because we make sex jokes elsewhere and don't move to NSFW
that stops no one
why are you people here then -_-
wait
there is an 18+ lock on this room
This is not the orgy room
there's no lock on it
No
for the group at least
this is that room
This is not that room
and this is that room
but sometime you need to "get a room"
but we all do that elsewhere
for when we all feel the need to be horny nsfw high schoolers
so someone remind me why we need this channel if the vast majority of our nsfw stuff happens in the other channels? i genuinely forgot
<@!460689096646590465>
why is nsfw in everyday talks
but I'm p sure there's a lot of unrelated demons
valid
They're both demons
why are salina and noah siblings now
what in the world
and that's 2 seconds of life i won't get back
I wasted the minimum possible time
I literally timestamped it for the segment
<@!193229269076279298> i resent you wasting my time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKiSPUc2Jck&feature=youtu.be&t=82
Works every time
thenere's i'm gonna assimilate into the righi household to turn noah gay
There's Gene?
and then
desperation
well there's
But I'm not wrong tho
Wow
I'm pretty desperate
well that's one way to get a boyfriend
If it'll convince him I'm basically his brother and therefore he should be super attracted to me, then ok I guess
do you want to be related to Noah
*oh yes*
_oh no_
Demonspawn or something
Isn't everyone
Then
And we're all related to them
But if they're both demons
the plot thickens
*l e  g a s p*
technically everyone on earth is related
they are related
wait <@!258094439636008971>
I don‚Äôt wanna deal with this bs
<@!193229269076279298> send help
That is true
that's not evidence
Ay, there we go
We‚Äôre not siblings
Still not an answer
I leave for dinner and this shit is happening
<@!340319804747415553> still not an answer
Jfc
They still haven't given us an answer
<@!193229269076279298> do you have something to say for yourself
Everything is nsfw
should the debate over Salina and me being siblings count as nsfw?
What if the penguin is her firstborn
or are we talking about your penguin
why are we discussing her firstborn
did Emily get pregnant
Konky
?
Konky
I'm sorry
Oh
Well, I'm sure it'll all work out for him in the end
in relationships he's unsure of how to act
Ohh
then when he had to stop doing gymnastics he picked up the gym
That sounds like a good way to get super hurt
While being swole? Damn
12 years of gymnastics
do you say that because you've only seen him when he's unsure and working out?
it's always been his outlet
Do you mean unsure of himself?
he's really not
na
that makes me think he's overcompensating with the working out
not to psychoanalyze Nicholas
he's just unsure himself I guess
But I would think if he's as nice a guy as you make him out to be he'd be fine
Well, if you don't wanna talk about it, you don't have to
How so?
he's arguably worse in relationships than I am
Isn't that good?
<@!193229269076279298> do you speak from experience
What do you mean?
he's super nice he's just idk
Cuz that is such a mood
Why is that a mood
but it's probably the thing he's worst at
Gabe doesn't date
He just smashes
so we are discussing Nicholas
Nicholas does
Gabe doesn't date
sorry corrected
you don't know if your brothers date?
just treat them well
idc if people date my brothers
Maybe he's tired of threesomes
Then again, I'm surprised as well
I doubt he gives up Nicholas
but we were discussing Nicholas
I'm guessing Gabe
One of them presumably
is <@!193229269076279298> giving his permission for someone to date his brothers???/
Except for when shit's coming out of his mouth
But Noah has a pretty nice face
That's true
well some people's faces you don't want to see up close
Why does how far away someone's face is matter in regards to attractiveness?
excuse me?
uh yea it does
<@193229269076279298> I don't height don't matter that much in regards to this tho
which one?
actually yes
thought so
no
do you _really_ want me to date your brother
Noah really stop and think about what you're saying
how about the king of iron
when Nicholas is queen of Egypt then we can talk
do you know who you're talking to?
<@193229269076279298> I'm not that tall
``power is sexy`` something something Nicholas can bench 285
<@!258094439636008971> tall boi
power is sexy
(That's a lie. Noah's probably more attractive than me if I'm being honest lol.)
Well, you're one to talk
wasn't Cleopatra supposed to be not that attractive ?
now, with modern technology, history can remember how extraordinarily mediocre most people are in stunning HD
only one way to find out
but there is contradictory historical info on whether or not she was actually hot
did she get mummified
maybe if she was alive
would not fuck her remains
now you've been exposed
idk
ok
would totally fuck Cleopatra tho
idk
fair
When did I say I wanted to fuck Cleopatra?
idk
No?????
isn't that exposing you?
_exposed_
necrophilia
cleopatra's dead
get out of denial, Cleopatra
I am not turning into Salina and Salina is not turning into me
weird combination of BDE and dumb hoe energy over here
uh
and then suffer extraordinary consequences later
i do whatever the fuck i want
im in ib
you Cannot
that's me
all three
it should be big sad dumb
which is why that chart is wrong
bc that‚Äôs impossible
why is there no big sad dumb energy?
ur wrong
this is wrong
tag urself
idk
what's the aries stereotype?
but people have very different perceptions of me
idk what it is so i wouldn't know
you don't match the stereotype much
really?
<@!520095106888630348> thanks
but a lot of people tend not to be surprised when they find out so eh
i forget what the stereotype is tho
<@!258094439636008971> yea you're an aries
and that i'm really violent
i think i'm an aries?
the stereotype is I will fuck anything and everything
ehhhh
sagittarius
power is just intensified
kind of
i'm a scorpio
power is like aggressively
what's the difference between power and soft?
at you
they say i‚Äôm a soft top but let‚Äôs be real i‚Äôm a kinky bottom
at who
how accurate is this to you and where do you place yourself
Lmao
but even Salina doesn't want to hear about it <@!193229269076279298>
of all people, I'd guess that you'd like hearing about it the most
No
Rip
:(
but you said `yeah`
don't
no
yeah
should I bring up my dick, Cindy loves hearing about it
Scroll up
this is not nsfw
arguably the american interpretation of the burger is its own thing (same with pizza)
philly cheesesteak
biscuits and gravy is american
southern-style fried chicken is also american
Ok. .. facts
orange chicken is american food
anything we can manifest density off of other cultures
although to their credit, kfc actually tries to make decent food for non-US countries and actually have some compelling products for a mediocre fast food chain (but there's still so much better out there)
what counts as american food
there is good american food, but this ain't it
nothing beats variety
very true
japanese food is so far superior
which is SO SAD
except for disappointment
you're not missing out on anything, noah
Japan is apparently kinda crazy for it
ye
idk if I've ever eaten kfc in the US now that I think about it
china's their biggest market by far
and a few times in tokyo
I saw it everywhere in china
used to get it in Germany
nope
but eh
which is ironic
except outside the US
irrelevant now
kfc is like
who needs bread and wine
john friend chicken
it's prob been like 10 years
Jesus Fried Chicken
damn idr the last time I had kfc
that too
what about kfc?
same cindy
every time I see `jfc` I think jfk
that's not what i was getting at
<@!258094439636008971> is closed minded
jfc
fair
but like still wack
for the joke it does
true
hey doesn't have to be a man and a woman
wack af
one of them starts licking the other's asshole
<@!193229269076279298> fuck you
well when a man and a woman love each other very much
I'd hope so
and i think i can infer what a rimjob is from everything else you guys have said
it would just feel like using snadpaper to wipe
oh
it wouldn't tear it open
l m a o
yep
I've got HL math
yeah I don't need a tiger for that
i don't need my ass to be torn open
so like
cats have barbed tongues meant to strip meat off their prey if I'm remembering right
i've had cats lick my hand till i bleed
yeah i'd rather not
h e l p
oh
come on
or not
wtf does that mean
Salina I have no doubt gets it
what does that mean
great
^
the cat tongue thing
is it
im scared to ask
I'd say "go get a rimjob from a tiger" as my response, but idk if everyone would get that
if we're going for degeneracy here
i MEAN
rip
i'm prob not winning any brownie points for that so uh
anyway
who knows
shrug
... for walruses?
lmao
polite bestiality
ah go politely fuck a walrus
it's going pretty well if I do say so myself
come join me
n u
._.
the effect is the same
also I can just drag you down to my degeneracy rather than raise myself up to yours
maybe she knows something you dont
you just implied it
I don't think I ever said I was?
you just might uh just maybe consider not being a necrophiliac thanks
but dw i still love you lol
at being a degenerate human being
false
"good"
what can I say <@!503787499605458954> I'm good
i'd say it's more chilling
shocking
I haven't yet personally
lmao rip
I rarely get the full ice queen treatment but indeed I have, and it is glorious
ftfy
*glare
na she doesn't need an ice bath, have you seen her glare at times
rip
the correct answer is "no, just disappointed"
i have deep concern for noah's future
are you surprised
r o o d
also cindy
lmao rip
my parents would be happy to hear that after how much they spent on those two bathrooms
ice baths and necrophilia
bc salina needs to get in an ice bath pronto
why are we talking about bathtubs?
it's a very clean design
it's also very heavy
actually aesthetic
the bath tub in noah's house is like
also side tangent
._.
perfect for your bf's tastes
oh so
the furnace is dead and so is my circulatory system
yea tell that to my dumbass best friend
because fuck it being the middle of the winter
people like noah are the reason people are scared to get into relationships
who needs an ice bath when your house is 48 degrees
you did comment on how "aesthetic" the tub was
I nominate you for the ice bucket challenge
look
quick salina
are you trying to tell us something, noah
I know you knew
unfortunately
I did know
._.
noah don't you fucking dare try anything
you know some people with necrophiliac fetishes have their partner lie in ice baths before fucking them to get that cold corpse feeling
good
so <@!340319804747415553> if your goal was to keep me breathing I think you won
._.
though I will say noah just reverse psychologied a reason for me to live
friendly reminder that christopher robinson is watching
hey look, we're in the right channel for once
it started so innocently

starfish
you can get the same result by just being bad in bed
I mean
weeeeeeeell
lack of response?
the uh
<@!193229269076279298> never talk to me or my children ever again
what's the point in it being a corpse then if it feels no different
N O A H
gotta wait for them to stiffen up
uhm
j f c
na if it's still warm it too like fucking a live person
._.
discord spell check is too pure
contextual clues
the novelty of fucking a still warm corpse
yes but
both... technically work
unless you were talking about "Neophile or Neophiliac, a term popularised by cult writer Robert Anton Wilson, is a personality type characterized by a strong affinity for novelty."
*necrophiliac
your 30 second grace period for spelling is over
the funny thing is what he said actually refers to something else according to google

I support you
solid choice
if you don't have any will to you'll die
life is for those with a will to live
I'm printing this out and framing it on my wall
amazing
"homework is for those with a will to live"
does this face look like the face of someone who cares whether or not you have homework to do?
this game destroyed it
homework is for those with a will to live
how is hw coming along
uh
it was nice knowing you guys
only one more level:
the infamous christopher robinson
I BEAT TIGGER
I DID IT
GUYS
do you guys think pooh is aware that all of his friends are sociopaths?
damn
because winnie the pooh is just so much harder
dark souls is the winnie the pooh home run derby of action rpgs
this is definitive
no
i think you can find which one came first tho
or winnie is the dark souls of obscure flash games
this is a chicken/egg thing
dark souls is the winnie the pooh home run derby of action rpgs
tigger is a sadistic bitch who changes speeds faster than an ib student changes ia topics
because this game is nsfw and will make you its bitch
of ALL places
is this in nsfw
why
update: tigger dont play by no rules
yet my most arduous challenges are yet to come
i have finally beaten owl in winnie the pooh home run derby
L
well
ok
oh
wait what?
lol
this weekend
when is wintercon?
I'm kinda dying
I think I"m just gonna bullshit the rough draft and do my experiment after wintercon tbh
yea
at least there is a correlation
well at least it will be interesting to talk about
ooooooof
i didn't exactly make up bs but my findings were near-opposite of my hypothesis
oh rip
L
just finished my physics experiment
elaborate
what
the amount of shit my brain feels like it's full of right now should be nsfw
lmao rip
I'm just giving you shit
idk why you think I actually care
what a surprise
oh look <@!340319804747415553> got it right
ayyyy nice one
me ;)
great minds think alike <@!520095106888630348>
and sorry <@!503787499605458954> it's not you
ayyy
gene
me
there is only one person who I care what they think about this
in reality idgaf what you think I am, because it doesn't change the reality
*"haha you are now and forever a bottom in our minds Noah
accept your fate"
no correction
accept your fate
haha you are now and forever a bottom Noah
"mission impossible"
maybe the name is the joke in this case
that was not a good series
not mission impossible
and if she rejects it?
your mission should you choose to accept it is to reshape my public image of being a bottom to being neutral
they're both bottoms and that's why both of them are just waiting for the other to answer
i've been summoned
er rip
i'm sorry i doubted you
<@!503787499605458954> you're totally right
isn't that total submissive behavior
<@!340319804747415553> I need you
I need to talk with my public relations specialist, because I am obviously not being portrayed correctly
ü§î ü§î ü§î
she‚Äôs right
ah
`I mentioned this at jsa Noah is totally a bottom`
-Cindy
what about tops and bottoms
but what I'm saying is on multiple different topics (not all of which have been brought up here) you need take your assuredness down a notch
for the top and bottom and I know you're referring to a specific person
Enjoy I guess??
Which like
Though I'm not sure what other people have been brought into this all I see are mentions of a cactus
Hey I was talking w the obvious context of a specific person smh
Lmao
<@193229269076279298> tell your brother I wanna play him sometime too
on multiple things
<@!503787499605458954> take your assuredness down a notch
well if we're bringing in random people
also how did I become a part of this conversation
tell them to fuck a usb port
seeing as I thought of it
I thought it was
really?
because that's not original
oh did you tell someone to fuck a cactus
not youngin
so I had to be sure
grammar and spelling errors in a insult are cause for instant death
if he's in IB comp sci he has to be a junior right?
jane I'm not fond of robbing the youngins
Hi Gabe
I just was asking Salina to double check it
I spelled it right
I do know how to spell it "cactus"
what
betting
also did you two bet on the smash game?
ok understandable Gabe, Noah doesn't know how to spell cactus
<@!520095106888630348> Nicholas would kill us if we called him anything other than Nicholas
"easy money"
-gabe
this ought to be interesting
I don't get challenged much at skyline
-gabe
but with noah as my teacher what did you expect?
yeah I never learned how to read D:
you're on
also did Gabe's brothers teach him how to read? My name is right there
_do you call him Nicho for short?_
Gabe: who spells Nicholas like that, who, who is that
Noah: That's Jane
Gabe: I'll beat her up
oh is Nicolas good at sweet-talking
but look where that got me
he takes after his brother
seductive
Gabe wants to smash tomorrow
<@!478706068223164416> you've been called out
A real love story huh
Lol
He sits next to him in CompSci apparently
Wow that‚Äôs very forward
he wants to smash
<@!478706068223164416> Gabe is trash talking you right now
Rip
Thanks
Nice
there i changed it
<@520095106888630348> I've never played him. Noah was referring to the time I played him.
"i'll make sure he doesn't beat me at smash ever"
"just wait until I run into your brother online"
that sounds mildly threatening
(gsp is a trash way of measuring skill tho)
Also, I might run into your brother online one of these days since we're in a similar gsp range
<@193229269076279298> I had played less than 5 hours of the game at that point, hadn't unlocked my main, and was using a single joy con.
Yea seeing as you and me are still 1:1 no chance
It's ok. Maybe if I beat Gabe in Smash, I can still impress him enough.
oooof
<@520095106888630348> when even Noah rejects you, that's when you know you've fucked up
what are you right about?
But I also know I'm right so
I'd just like to point out that they never answered the question here
lmfao
<@258094439636008971> I'm sorry I couldn't make it happen
profit: 4c
simple, get Gene to join JSA, get him to go to a Fall/Winter/Spring State, share a room, share a bed
Rip
Gene's body in a bed for a 4c, seem a bit too easy but ok I'll take it
What about in bed with you
Lmao
Gene's body in a ditch in exchange for a 4c, no questions asked I'll do it
Questionable
Uhhh
But not better than me
yea I agree
I‚Äôm better than a 4c
Come on
L o v e  m e ,  N o a h
What
like a 4c?
What if I get you a really nice wedding present when you marry Gene
L
yes
Are you threatening me
Rip
I mean, I really don't
It seems like some people really don't want to see tomorrow
Except Noah
I don't think anyone does
<@520095106888630348> wait no, I don't want that
Lmfao
I thought what we had was realllll
Time to fuck the brothers
Shocking development !
HOW COULD U
*dabs on 'em*
N O A H
Who isn't?
I mean
Conclusion: Noah is in love with Gene
Ayyy
the doc is public and editable
When I used the data Noah and Gene were together
uh I had Salina double check the data for me
And as Noah and Salina will recall
He doctored it so the people he likes are matched with him
Hahaha
what?
NOAH RIGGED THE DATA
idk how much I'd trust that data <@!258094439636008971>
Do what you think is right
Eh
I will withhold my answer
Technically we should know
We did those tests a while back tho, right?
do you really
Shrug
do you really want me to answer it though
I‚Äôm a switch so you can fuck off
Don‚Äôt pin it on me lol
<@193229269076279298> you're on the hot seat
Then you can answer it
Hmph
Jane wants her question answered
Why am I needed
<@193229269076279298> I mean, if you told us about your brothers, we'd be able to deduce enough about you
<@!340319804747415553> you're needed
Salina can answer that for you
oh
You and Salina
for my brothers?
Top or bottom
You still never answered my question
Gabe has better things to care about
Gabe is not a people person, because Gabe does not care what you think
So I'm pretty sure this means it's just a Noah thing
Well
Me: Describe Gabe in three words
Junior in band: unique, annoying, self-centered
<@193229269076279298>
Yes
you have Em in your class?
He's in my film class I think
did I mention Nicholas 4.0 Diploma
photos of Gabe are hard to come by
so he's quite a bit bigger now
oh and this is two years ago
Me: Do you know Gabe Righi
Junior in band: Yeah
Me: What do you the of him?
Junior: ehhhhhh?
grey tank top, blue shorts
Show photos of your brothers
<@193229269076279298> pics or it didn't happen
Gabe you just have to meet
Nicholas for more objective reasons
both of my brothers are amazing people
Or a foursome
They are, that doesn't justify this level of attraction
IM BEING HONEST
it's fucking impressive
Don't do a threesome with the brothers
WHAT
come on
Nicholas benches 285
Salinaaaa
Admittedly lol
His brothers are pretty great tho
Noah
Me or Noah?
Lmfaooooo
I'm scared of you now
He keeps talking about how jacked they are and how much respect he has for them
I'm a middle child too but that is outside of the norm for middle children
I'm the middle child
And he's got a thing for both of them
I have two brothers
You have more than one brother?
which brother are we talking about?
<@193229269076279298> <@258094439636008971> WHY WOULD NOAH KNOW WHAT HIS BROTHER IS
good point
tired drunk you is probably asleep
that's a beast of its own
idk bout tired drunk me
tired me is def worse than drunk me
i m s o r r y
i leave you guys for 15 minutes
yet
"yet"
... yet
i'm not *that* much of a ho
D:
it was all of her own accord
it wasn't on purpose
I did nothing
i'm sorry
tell cole
regret everything
i
._.
<@!340319804747415553> <@!193229269076279298> Cole is scandalized
idk
but like yeah
then i'm gonna do a list of expenses
i'm trying to write another 300 words for business IA
but things are okay
ok same
i'm tired
my day's been pretty good actually hbu
pretty sure it's too late to pretend to be lesbian
can't help you there
hi guys, how're your days going
so many things
i regret
it d o e s
this seems to be a very much you problem
i need a new bf
._.
I mean I don't have a problem with it
noah why
._.
what it was supposed to be like
that's not
gdi
no
üò≤
._.
post it
oh damn
no context needed
üëÄ
I didn't notice at first but I mean
hahaha
I mean do you see it
omg
LOL
this order of messages is concerning
and RIGHT you can
hi passive aggression
are you really bad at writing?
hi noah <3
you can totally store stuff in a vagina
oh come on
but
wait I just came back
i don't trust him with hw that requires writing
no homework no sleeping
but also
unfortunately
no
Noah does your homework for you?
and someone to write this business IA
I am perfectly capable of coming up with my own idea, thank you very much
i think i need hugs
you think I need ideas?
don't give him ideas
._.
maybe with noah
you're tired go to sleep
i want a hug
h i
but yes you can
SALINA
lmao
like drugs
you can store things in a vagina
noah, watch where you're treading, bitch
.....
does this mean you need to be able to store things in your vagina to be allowed to call it a hole?
that's rude
are you shaming non-storage identifying holes
sure
if you intend on burying something in it
how many inches do you need
I dug a one inch grave, is it a hole?
you dig a hole
how do you make a grave
it's a fancy word for a hole
i disagree
a grave is a hole!
no you call it a grave
"because we need to store her body"
who says they put something into a depression
"just a hole"
IT WORKS DOES IT NOT
"not a depression"
"we put grandma into a hole last week"
"so yeah"
salina i don't think your boyfriend likes me
lmao
what kind of definition is that
like a dead body
that's your definition
w h a t
W H A T
a hole has to be able to store something
ok so where do you draw the line
okay but a vagina is a deep depression
i think there is a small region of overlap but generally a hole is  deeper than a depression
no, my state of mind is though
holes that are tunnels are not depressions
but every hole is a depression?
not every depression is a hole
so how depressed does it need to be to count?
because it's a depresion
but why?
yes
does that make it not a hole tho
is the vagina a hole
back to the original point then
fine
anatomy & physiology lessons need not be in nsfw
yes
.... it does?
"the other end"
at the end
but it splits?
stop
because they have a lil hole for pee to come out of
are penises holes
which means if we're talking about a vagina both dimensions are non static
because it also gets deeper
assume a fixed diameter hole, with a fixed depth
but I'm not trying to argue a dynamic shape here
well yea if you force it into that shape
._.
it can be
I'm using the shape of circle because we can base any other formulas off of it
well
if that's what we're going by
I know that
well it's also not circular
see crater
it can be really deep but still not a whole if it's really wide as well
it all depends on the ratio
it started with noah and it's just spread
i've become the resident spellcheck
how is the vagina not a hole
I was like ????
to realize you were correcting noah as usual and not something I said
oh it took me so long
lmfao
is the vagina a hole
*hear
by your classification standards
but
this is like the first thing people think of when they think "hole" and "human body"
alright lets hear it then
ok I know
lol r i p
jOiN fReNcH cLuB
and I just repeated salina in a way that elaborated on why misterioso looks uncomfortable to us english speakers
one with the bread
he speaks the baguette language
yeah
for that matter
or take spanish
gene didn't even say shit
Salina already does it enough
you're welcome bitch
fuck off with the Spanish people
mister ioso
tru
that mystery/mysterious look so much better in english
can i just say
es muy misterioso
konky kola
no se
good question
konky
why did you say no
lmao
._.
why did i say no
wait
welcome to the internet
so how is that a "no"
well I mean you just proved me right
oh
some people might be into that (?)
or using a chocolate dildo
bc that's also a reddit thing ._.
weeeeeeeeeeeelll
that's the equivalent of fucking a coconut
so like
cuz they eat fish
no
not not technically a food kink
*not good to know
just because it happens doesn't make it okay
it's really not
it's technically a food kink
... good to... know?
... uh fun <@!258094439636008971>
is it ok to violate all females of a species because it's the societal norm
<@!340319804747415553> dolphins stick their penises in decapitated fish heads
big think
is it bad if they're all rapists?
no
._.
do i want to know?
what do dolphins do
uh
i guess that technically qualifies as a food kink if youre a dolphin
I've said so many highly questionable quotes tonight
r i p
it's not every day you realize the mallards you fed at pine lake as an 8 year old are probably rapists ok
not as much as gifs of dolphins doing shit to fish heads
rip?
and it scars me a little more each time
I've seen that fact on reddit at least 10 times
dicks are dicks when it comes to their ducks
we been knew
ducks are dicks when it comes to their dicks
the world may never know
yep
corkcscrew penis
but do humans?
but yes
most have cloacas
yep
ducks have dicks i think
they diff tho
and they have eggs
humans do eggs
birds don't have dicks technically
technically
i mean
yeah you really don't need to apologize
oh i forgot fish do eggs
idk why that's so funny to me but it is
well sorry
`sorry` lmfao
lol it's not a problem
i like fish
sorry
voila
oh
i don't do marine bio
i can't swim
gene
the least possible elegant way I could've explained that
<@!340319804747415553> dolphins would beg to differ on your opinions of fish
that was like
for obvious reasons
i keep 10 feet between me and marine bio at all times
post-body-exit
and then fertilize the eggs
but they're not fish
a lot of them lay eggs
fish aren't exactly in my wheelhouse
dolphins
do they?
well
how do fish have sex
yes??
idk
what
do fishes have dicks
something something bo burnham much?
I would
lmao
now there's a concept
don't drink and type kids
The first time I told Makenna I had a 3d printer she asked can you print me a dildo as a joke, so I made a chocolate dildo mold to make one and give it to her as a birthday present, no you're not supposed to fuck it, you're supposed to eat it, "eat a dick"
chocolate tea
damn
is drinking and typing
all that chocolate tea
"big brother is drinking is typing..."
judgment has been passed
we stan
sounds about right
a gloriously idiotic madman it is
prob true
damn lol
answer that question yourself
gene, i didn't need to know that
you knew this already salina
i mean, he might still have the supplies
am i dating an idiot or a madman or both
ok no I am not interested in putting a chocolate dick up my ass
i asked earlier and i'm still fucking confused
yeah explain
noah, explain yourself
eww
at least it wasnt noah's chocolate dildo
like body shots
but sticky
oh
<@!258094439636008971> lick if off their body
chocolate sauce üòõ
simple
you like chocolate with your sex
because that's different tiers of tea
both
seriously or jokingly
but how tf does that work
lol
and I'm still into the idea
we started talking about food in nsfw because I admitted to a potential chocolate kink
also to answer your earlier question
im dad
i need to stop being hungry
hi hungry
im hungry
go off queen
wow lol
i could go tok on this shit righttttt now
"do good explanations need to be true"
mmmh
but it balances out so that she's wholesome overall
that's news to me
cindy is p wholesome when she's not absolute trash. one extreme or the other
y'all can't say I'm not self-aware
^^^also seeeeee
only 30%???
that's too nice gene
I am at least 70% trash
sorry lol
jkjk
<@!503787499605458954> you are what you eat
^
it's my own fault lol
i don't eat that much usually
I feed myself trash 30% of the time
i like eating but like
idk lol
because food porn
but like
I love my body and was on a huge nutrition kick over the summer
why are we talking about food in nsfw
rip
i tell people close to me that their cooking is good to be nice, so just a heads up, sorry guys (although it might actually be good so sorry for devaluing any potential genuine compliments)
same
there are a multitude of examples
i love good food and health but eat plenty of terrible options
i will have a big opinion
unless they sell it to me
i cant judge their food
I don't feel bad for having refined opinions
like, fam, i get that some people just need nutrition
i am a food snob
I feel bad for being obnoxious
I do but I don't
i am, but i feel bad about it
sorry
I am a food snob
rip?
my brother turned me into a minor food snob so rip me
my grandma has cravings for raw garlic
because when they grew up they were starving with no good delicacies
my extended family especiallyy grandparents have weird tastes in food
this is the genetic disease we need the cure for tbh
i bet i don't because both of my parents love cilantro
unless you like soap
if you're not absolutely repulsed by it you probably dont have it
but now I love
I used to not like cilantro
i will try the next time i have it
tok
i have not eaten cilantro enough to tell
sense perception is flawed
some people have a thing where they perceive cilantro as soapy-tasting
???
<@!472541429130854421> it makes cilantro taste like soap
it's wavy af
i'm fine with it
cuz i thought you meant me
i don't
so i was shook
my sister has the gene
you even referred to it as the "cilantro gene"
what is the cilantro gene
it tastes occupied but with a taste barely discernable to human taste buds
are synced
the wangs
we both brought up cilantro at the same time
or not empty
<@!503787499605458954> wtf
it tastes empty
wavy!
wait
dragonfruit is godly smh
and then it bled into actual mangoes :(
cilantro: wavy or wack
does anyone here have the soapy cilantro gene
dragonfruit is gross
i first noticed it with the hi-chews
you are
i'm weird
there's like a weird tar aftertaste for me
favorite fruit by awesomeness is dragonfruit hands down
i used to love mangoes but i don't like it as much as before
`tap that before you wrap that` wrong order
banana is good for cooking
ooh i also love lychee and dragon's eye
mango is good taste but eh texture
idk
favorite fruit for cooking is def banana
mango is great
that was such a bad joke
but the shell of a watermelon doesn't rot as the insides get bad
sorrrrrrrrry
favorite fruit by taste is probably mango
tap that before you wrap that
bongo the shit out of it
like if you see a rotten orange you're staying away from that
listen to the watermelon's whispers
lol
because the outside doesn't indicate the inside well
gotta tap that shit to tell if it's fresh
^^
it's just more likely to get a bad watermelon
watermelon ain't consistent
that applies to all fruit
i live for pomegranates
lol
ok good watermelon is fantastic but bad watermelon is watery and sad
i like watermelon probably
and the alfa romeo 4c
watermelon is close second
blackberry
the faith of saint nicholas and saint gabe
my brother dont worship me this aint fair
that is difficult
hey I worship other things as well
go
favorite fruit
wait quick poll
HARD disagree
we've been over this
lmao
and yes he worships his brothers
kiwis are overrated as well
if you say "Jesus Christ" he used to say "you called"
we are always buying more kiwis for some reason
blueberries are great too though
worship your brother?
you
um
that is me w strawberries
``my god gabe``
we are always buying more
i did too
they're good to make sweets with
my god gabe eats a Costco bag of blueberries in like 3 days constantly
they're aight
they kind of are
but they overrated
i still like strawberries
excuse me, i have great taste
strawberries are the bomb
blackberries are underrated tho
you guys have shitty taste in food
strawberries are overrated ngl
now i want
and got it there with a shit ton of giant strawberries
she went to the met
ice cream always makes sense
it was for ‚Äòpractice‚Äô
ice cream makes more sense tbh
lmao
so i started licking the lid
try it huh? ;)
yogurt would make more sense
i decided to try it and the easiest way to try it was via the lid
why
what kind of cream?
like
weren't you listening
ok but
april
who just randomly brings a jar of cream to class?
eric took it and starting erotically eating spoonfuls of it
well what happened was april had cream
I'm trying to add detail to Kenneth's story
jkjk
bye
ok, im out
wtf
im back
what is happening
hey, guys
licking food containers is an enjoyable activity
._.
cumming?
i was very close2
p
but did you make love to it
and i loved it
and hey, I killed it
ok fair
i was licking cream of a lid
dead, yes, boring, I would disagree
fixed
L?
`boring and dead` like your romance life
not on task
exist
our class is like
just let it be
our math class is boring and dead
don''t explain
`depends on what you count as sex` I still want my answer
idk you brought it up
how am i supposed to explain this
i'm just not giving a damn in that class
I approve
gay
bc holy shit
in the back of the classroom
*tbh
what happens
n i c e
that's not a hugely contentious debate th
wtf
i was licking cream erotically with eric in math if that counts
thoughts people
`depends on what you count as sex` this is an interesting debate
hi kenneth
this is a real man
i like food
well, depends on what you count as sex
and I'm not taking the test
"the idea of"
i mean, you haven't either lol
strongly agree ‚úî
well have you had sex?
chocolate doesn't appeal that much to me
once i took an asexuality quiz cuz why the fuck not and one of the questions was something like "the idea of food makes you more excited than the idea ofsex"
chocolate is love
no it's just me
i like dark chocolate but for most part
b i g  w i n
yall really gonnna be THAT couple
i m s o r r y
i win
ok
wow
i will take both cuz no rule saying you cant
chocolate is like eh
yea cause you've only had chocolate
i'll take the romance
BIG facts
i love chocolate more than romance
lol
üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ
lmao
fucking laptop kink here
damn you'll be cheap to please
chocolate is sexy though so can you really blame me
jk lol
i'm a long term hooker bitch
oh I guess I alluded to a potential chocolate kink
how many hooker jokes in that?
lmao
not as bad as my french essay at least
it wasn't that bad
smh
I made ONE (1) hooker joke
gotta spread it around I guess
huh?
how can we not seem to keep it in this chat?
but the legs have hair now too
you're welcome!
i can't get that imagery out of my head
noah is just defending the fact that his buff brothers have become so barrel chested that their upper bodies are just eggs now, but they have legg, and he finds that attractive
1 single data point that was pretty clearly meant as a joke but ok go off I guess
`hot`
a kink kink
of the data point I have the trend is not in that direction
is it possible to have a kink for kinks?
yes
hahaha
you sure
at the very least, I don't have an egg legg kink
be me
and then like
if any of y'all had taste, you guys would legally change your names to "Gene Wang"
smh, rude
don't lie to us
egg with legg lmao
that was a thing
no you don't
egg with legg
I have TASTE
omg
i'm KIDDING
rip?
no
hot
it had a face too
it had fishnets and heels for some reason
but it was a fucking egg for whatever reason
they drew it one day during lunch, and the thing scarred me for life
<@!271149039020408843>
actually, i think jeesoo was involved in that monster's creation
but like really long legs and it was running
lmao
a couple of my friends drew an egg with legs
I think that's nsfl
in sophomore year
I think I have issues
oh my gosh
a million human legs
I imagined an egg with like
that was actually a typo, but a very convenient one
noah, stop creeping on the kiddosz
egg
lmao
`leggal`
I'm not
i am a leggal minor
most of us are legally minors
i mean, to be fair, some of us are legally minors
hi Salina!
no kids in the nsfw channel made tht instantly less innocent
like you bringing up
idk
literally the first thought that went through my head <@!472541429130854421> "trigger warning: pedophilia"
imagine how disappointed konky dong tang will be when she hears that you didn't contribute to her naming
but that's what doing nsfw shit can do
no children in nsfw channel
hi jane <3
hahaha
https://tenor.com/view/no-nooo-nope-eat-fingerwag-gif-4880183
it's for the collective good
come on jane
<@!520095106888630348>
^^
oh wait
konky dong
it is
i'll only vote for it if it's konky donkey
wtf
this is so unfortunate
i love it
lmfao
donkey kong but reversed
konky dong tang
dong
tonky
any middle names in mind?
alright, nice
^^
it‚Äôs gender neutral
both
is konky a girl name or a boy name?
the fate of the firstborn hangs in the balance
k o n k y
lol no one asked me anything else anyways soooo
this is important tho, noah
something something not tagging people
o boi
@everyone
lmaoooo
7 more to go
i pinned it
come on guys
I know, I wrote it
rip
10 thumbs up and i‚Äôll name my first born child konky
there's definitely a masturbation joke in there
you still have to explain yourself
ooo konky
noah
rip
yea for getting beat it seems
i have a ______ konk
I will find you and burn you
"konky" is exactly why we do not spell it that way
k o n k y
i wheezed
no
"konky"
as
what if we spelled kinky
mood
kinky
rip
i fuck myself over pretty hard with my procrastination if that counts
anything is possible
l m a o
it would be physically impossible for me to fuck myself harder w a vibrator than ib math is already doing
explain the chocolate dildo
broke financially and broke emotionally
rip
"Several people are typing..."
idk what life you‚Äôre living but ib made me a broke bitch
yes
lmfao
no, we make ib rich
sex doesn't make you rich, but ib does
or maybe the converse is true
explain, bitch
please don‚Äôt put chocolate up your ass
wait wtf <@!193229269076279298>
or to get ass ravaged by math
can we talk about that time noah spent several weeks getting the supplies to make a chocolate dildo?
damn even sex gotta be for the rich
gotta be rich to have a good time
basically you gotta be rich
^^
vibrators can be just as expensive as ib exams if not more so at that point it‚Äôs just up to what you prefer
so not fun
basically silicon is expensive
<@!193229269076279298> i think your perception of dildos is off cuz you're only familiar with chocolate dildos
~100 per test
also size
rip?
dildos are expensive but ib exams are more expensive
how much are IB exams?
i mean
probably not...
no...
cheaper than an ib exam
yeah but is it good sex
dildos are expensive
l m a o
"i don't need sex because depression fucks me everyday"
f u ck
damn
than ib exams
u right
dildo is cheaper
for real
why buy a dildo when you can take IB HL math
cute
oh, hey, she actually did the winky face this time
lmao rip maths
no need for apologies; this is the nsfw channel
jk haha
so
about every 3 weeks
anything else fucking you hard? ;)
math rips me a new asshole
everything has a line
math fucks me so hard, so yes NSFW
is about 10x better than my "optimally functioning"
but it's a bit too nsfw even for the nsfw channel
so i get that math is nsfw
salina your `not functioning`
laughs in functioning but at a great risk
ok, salina
maybe I just wanted to say it
it was hilarious
dude i was so dead in math
we still appreciate your presence
laughs in not functioning
ok............................... big facts, but you don't gotta say it
some of us are functioning
well
the rest of us are functioning humans and can't relate
I felt compelled to answer
i was just absent
noah asked
*derailed
the rest of us have deriled
human disaster
but we've moved on
hi it's me
cindy is still talking about the one thing by herself
i'm sorry for your trauma
my reaction time is usually too slow to stop from falling backwards lmao
cindy
sometimes I catch myself but like when I'm already sleepy
pants
so
is not there
the thing that supports your ass
it all comes back to smash
when you realize
c
and then there's a moment of pani
we've come full circle
idk man like I just go for it
smash bros
explain a WWE smash
since when was home depot ever right?
like how do you not notice?
do you sit down like you're doing a WWE smash on someone?
no toilet is displayed on home depot with the lid up
yeah my ass has touched that water many times
and it's hilarious
if people are careless, they get pee everywhere
if it belongs down then WHY CAN IT GO UP
in the middle of the night when I'm sleepy and not paying attention
C L O S E  T H E  L I D
BUT
it belongs down
pun intended
ok it doesn't actually bother me when people leave it up
and yes that wording is intentional
you put it down, put it back up
close the toilet lid and piss everyone off like me
then stop trying to get things to be up
you put it up so you put it back down
if I can put the seat up you can put it down
never done that <@!503787499605458954>
ME
well that‚Äôs not very NSFW of you
ok noah
girls who else has fallen into a toilet bc someone in your family left the seat up
uhm
no, I've always wanted to know what it would feel like to kill someone
we can just pee in the wilderness but that requires the removal of the pant
<@!193229269076279298> does it ever bother you that the guy on your left could just spaz out and pee all over you in the middle of the day
we gotta carry around bottles of our piss and lemme tell you life would be so much easier aiming as a guy
going for distance is always a easy way to pass the time
hiking/mountaineering at high altitudes
fun in practice as well
for example
unspoken but very real
ok but like
there is pissing etiquette
Funny in theory
*matters
but like lmao
loool
tbf i wouldn't actually do it
urinals are like chess, but it actually matters
note to self: salina would be a creep if male
lmao sorry i'll shut up
as you nonchalantly take a piss
hold their stare
it's that one meme with the urinals
if you look over you're dead as a man
Like a lot more acne which is obviously important to me lmao
a question of asserting dominance
hey actually
everyone thinks pain is funny in 1st grade and they all wanna kick each other in the balls
question of the day
what‚Äôs it like standing next to each other as you pee simultaneously
Guys have other problems
they just make everyone else uncomfortable
some guys still do
i mean
y‚Äôall don‚Äôt have to take off your pants to pee. girls have a Whole Ritual
like I"m not trans but I am jealous
also
being a guy is just so convenient
i d k
lol
???
helicopter?
in that response
of course
bc i would
3 levels of science
do boys attempt the helicopter  w their dicks
basically temp control for sperm
Because sperm can't be inside the body
sperm
WHY DO TESTICLES EXIST
I kinda wish I had one though
They really are
erreyone be cray
._.
penis are weird af, and i say that as a guy
penises are weird
s t r. a w
lmao
I like how as soon as I make a reference Salina defaults to "everyone stop"
Like I'm the last straw for humanity lmao
off topic but i find penises particularly unpleasant
that I can be
not talking about his dick. just about him. noah is a dick.
lmao
noah is probably secretly a spider, so that's a dick that is a spider
not surprised you of all people got it
from that description
everyone stop lmao
I hate that I know what you're talking about
emi you can stop too
spiders but made out of dicks
Spiders with dicks
oh fuck
... noah stop lmao
dicks but made of spiders
idk, you seen the dark souls boss
...
dicks shoot out spiders
i have no life therefore no tea
thank you very much
I do not want erotica comparing spider legs to penises
i am revealing the hottest of tea rn
Someone please reveal some tea
Yeah we need to make this more explicit
everything you knew was a lie
that's why when you hit them and put cracks in their body they lose pressure and their legs curl up
they spew out spiders, guys
this is not NSFW
penises are just spiders
So you basically just mean a piston
oh ok he's explaining
did you know spiders don't have muscles to open their legs, their entire exoskeleton is pressurized to open their legs, muscles pull the leg back in though
explain
.... sigh
well, half of spiders
like spiders
no, penises are hydraulic
i think
we can change that
what she's getting at is it depends on what you use it for
Straws are open on both ends
Not really straws
am i Wrong
emily, no
...
penises are just meat straws
it's all just thicc blood
A boner does not really consist of bones contrary to popular belief
and do we have proof that noah is actually a human?
in some animals
i mean
lmfao
i have no context
you do realize there aren't joints in your dick?
It sounds more raunchy out of context than it really was
why
whaaaat
i don't think that's how it works
at my birthday party i heard somebody say something about noah‚Äôs dick arthritis
idk, when the power goes out the lighting for photos is pretty great
really? even if everyone gives the go ahead?
hahaha
you all look wonderful enough already in your clothes. no need to send pictures without clothes.
especially <@!193229269076279298>. no one wants to see that
Whoever does instantly faces the hot ban button
3) send sexts/nudes
(seductively strips)
l m a o
True there could be actual sexts being sent through here
oh I could make this far worse than you think really fucking fast
good lord i've seen worse at this point
1) critique amateur porn
2) orgy
other ideas?
i'm with them on it too
I'm sure noah's w me on this this is not nearly as bad as we could go
lmfao
NSFW was originally just sex jokes but now it's explicitly about sex
this is NOT as nsfw as possible
we make it as nsfw as possible here
i feel like in here
yeah but like
rip?
we just one up the nsfw stuff in the other chats here
it does indeed
And stronger than ever
this seems like a question for a drinky drink time
glad the nsfw chat is back up and running properly now
but like I don't wanna consciously draw their attention for this lmao
*KICKED
lmao
BANNED
oh I know
lmao im just kidding
If you say they may find the message anyway
BYE
oh GOD
@hennig
I'll tell you if you don't @ them
Gene #2 is bae
Yes tea
Gene is already claimed by his clone
oh tea
<@503787499605458954> who would you fuck
i‚Äôd fuck myself
only i'm allowed to flirt with me
thanks salina
I'm not serious!!
`in all seriousness I would fuck very few of you
`
cindy stop flirting with everyone
Orgy was first proposed by Katya if I remember correctly
`no one is naturally buff` not technically true
there it is again
i'm with cindy on this
it's what I'm here for babe
hey
and then we had "Several people are typing..."
üòâ
and then someone else proposed an orgy
laughs in can barely lift the bar
no one is naturally buff
someone proposed critiquing porn together
what‚Äôs the sibling version of freud‚Äôs oedipus complex
A lot of us are scrawny nerds
well
w h a t i s h a p p e n i n g
best response tbh
Few people in this group are the naturally bufd kind of person
... jfc
`do it without your consent` do I need to get a rape whistle?
consent is important
^^
ok no I don't actually wanna be a powerlifter
The point of an intervention is that we do it without your consent
new life goal
once you bench more than either you can
petition to hold an intervention for noah‚Äôs older and younger sibling issues
We're in for one wild party
Smash and chill are polar opposite events
it's usually his other brother
actually, that's new
we know
I smash Gabe all the time
smash and chill
`can we do a critique of amateur porn` this would imply someone having enough experience to critique
in all seriousness, i'd just tell y'all to go fuck yourselves jokingly and then leave to go play smash bros instead of smashing
`very few` hmm
glad we‚Äôre all on the same page
in all seriousness I would fuck very few of you
not with you guys
thanks but no thanks
hard pass on that
let's go
orgy
lmao
oh my god helen
i would rather just not
Would you rather do it by yourself üòè
or anyone for that matter
i would rather not do an analysis of porn with you people
I'm down
no
can we do a critique of amateur porn
`if you guys come over I'm ok with watching porn as long as my parents aren't home`
<@!193229269076279298> is that invitation extended to your parents?
hey I invited **everyone** to come watch porn at my house
here's a tip: if you're gonna watch porn, don't do so at noah's house after he's invited you to watch it with him
w o w
let's keep it that way
i've actually like never  watched porn
._.
idk, sounds like an interesting time
let's... not lmao
lmfao what
Gabe won't give a shit
if you guys come over I'm ok with watching porn as long as my parents aren't home
lmao
you guys wanted the full experience and went for whatever you could
on the big screen with surround sound is what i'm saying
l m a o
^^
so yea we had worse
I'm pretty sure we had access to an internet connection
so it was basically like trying to watch porn
it was the closest thing to porn you guys had easy access to tbh
that was at best softcore porn
last time you guys tried to watch a movie with me, you guys tried to watch porn while my parents were home
I have a media room...
i'd be down to watch it with friends regularly at some point
i watched titanic at 2x speed for the EC last year
damn
to watch people die
why would I?
I haven't seen titanic either
there's a lot of movies that i should have seen by now that i just havent tho
ok that's respectable
all i know is the recorder rendition of the music
get out
i havent seen the titanic
uh huh
yall know what I'm talking about
rip
oh god I'm having flashbacks to that titanic scene
ü§î ü§î ü§î
i swear a third of these are just innuendos
üò¢
Is... The nsfw channel active again??
well she'd need to turn around first
Truly inspiring.
we need a better name for our group
also this server name is shitty
it has become difficult to control the NSFW
but still
yeah no shit
well the nsfw has kinda just spilled everywhere at this point
I can't believe we haven't used this channel in half a month
g'night
hah, im going back to work
I'm going to sleep
Damnit pancreas eating
A real important question is why we're still awake
"Where the fuck is the pancreas eating" - Gene
"It's fun to watch people be [...] sad and shit" -Jiayi
This guy asking the important questions
also nice trailer, but where the fuck is the pancreas eating
It's fun to watch people be cute and happy and sad and shit
Yeah but it is just interesting to me for some reason
i would assume that you wouldn't really care much for a relationship in that position, so it's still odd to watch a movie glamorizing someone else's
but at the same time
it could also be regular single people who aren't super lonely
the problem i have with romance movies is that i'm never sure if the target audience is lonely single people or people actually in relationship
-the movie has to have conflict, which might be awkward for a couple
-the resolution to the conflict (assuming a happy ending) is too dissonant for someone super single to relate to
You can watch the trailer here
https://youtu.be/MmoBvmJA9XI
The movie is so good
No seriously
what
oh wait
there's a live action of it called "venom"
And it's actually a very normal and sweet romance movie
There is an anime movie called "I want to eat your pancreas"
be sorry to the amt of sleep you're getting
don't be sorry to me haha
k
dude go do your hw
rip?
wait nvm
btw
You'll probably see me playing fire emblem conquest on friday at lunch
im gonna silently wish for my death for 4 hours until i sleep
I'm gonna go read a bit and then go to sleep
Cya
ty
gl on hw
later gene
ephraim
later y'all
eirika
ishtar
i havent done anything in like 4 hours
reinhardt
anyways, i gotta do work
tru tru
esp since FEH made them get super popular
the vocals in this game were just crazy
thracia and SS seem to have potential for remakes ngl
crazy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdukGRFZUws
to this
like going from that
I never got to play any of the GBA games
I hope they remake more old FE games
listening to this was what made me realize how much justice a remaster did this game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4fA6U0-mtc
8-bit land of sorrow:
that was crazy
d u d e
y e s
"Don't do this to me"
I was like
One of my strongest memories of this game was after beating the game and the title screen changed from alm and celica as children to adults
but paled in comparison to everything else
lemme make the joke in peace
like they were k
yeah ik
but not even
lol
alm's was alm-ost good
you could say it was
land of sorrow hits when you start chap 4, and you're just like "o shit shit just got real"
the overworld songs are all just really good aside from alm's lol
it's the act 2 overworld theme
It's really peaceful and nice
it's what i think about when i think of this game
that super bright violin motif that jumps up really high always gets me tho
people always forget it cuz it's so early
seeee?
This is good
Woah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmmWZCiCqs
radiant ark was and underrated song on an underrated ost tho
https://youtu.be/CzKptJ9VIiE
heritors of arcadia had great vocals
Because that moment finishing the game felt kind of surreal to me
I'm gonna say the credits song
I really can't choose
The credits song was good too
as long as you enjoyed it
The opening theme, Omen, is great as well as the title theme, Echoes
also nw salina
favorite?
solid one but like
pls don't kill me
and don't have one?
i'm a heathen
The final map theme immediately comes to mind
what's your guys' fav song from echoes?
poor silque
but not funny cringe
it was cringe
Dude her support with silque was ridiculous haha
faye: back off
silque: uh k
10/10 support
faye: i like alm
silque: uhhhh
oh my gosh
just
in the whole game
the voice acting tho
I would've disliked her a lot more if it wasn't for the voice acting, that helped me like her a bit more since at least what she said was fun to listen to
shallow yet has a ton of supports all about the same thing
echoes does a great job of giving characters depth or giving them so little screentime that you don't care.
faye is the mistake
she's a one-dimensional character and kinda hard to believe
there's better shit to do
like bish
okay she's kinda sweet but HOLY
alm was still p wholesome about it tho tbh
lmao
when i found out faye was an addition that wasn't in the original, i was like "yo, echoes, your fire emblem fates is showing"
lmao
Somebody please hit her so hard she loses her memories and resets she needs a new goal in life that's not just living and dying for alm
alm: ".... uh"
faye: "WATCH ME KILL THIS GUY FOR YOU ALM"
"like please don't"
alm was super wholesome about it tho
Oh my god faye
ack
yeah
holy shit
faye does not take a hint
leon at least kinda gets it
unrequited love much
At first I didn't like him but he grew on me
Leon so precious
it was wholesome af
Well not really more like a one-sided love, but great friendship
i thought that was one-way (leon deserves better tho. he's precious)
Also leon-valbar
rings a bell
yeah
saber had something about moving back to the land of mercenaries founded by jesse along with his younger wife
huh interesting
that one was the only time it felt weird
saber's also hinted at it, but i forget what it was
genny's post-game thing was like "nobody knows who she married, but people were surprised to find out it was significantly older"
shit i forgot lol
at the end
when was genny and saber hinted at?!?
wait
modern fire emblem is literally eugenics
^
"how do i give this kid galeforce"
I'd like to believe saber-genny happened
literally custom marriages were like
Alm-celica
Saber-genny was hinted at but not confirmed
dude
a lot less forced tbh
kinda cringy but pretty sweet
like boi this is kinda creepy
clive-mathilda
pretty cute but like eh
clair-gray
i hated custom marriages
just hilarious
mae-boey
it was a breath of fresh air
I just wish there were more support convos
the official ships were too cute
A lot of people were complaining Echoes didn't have custom marriage/shipping, but tbh I didn't mind and I really liked the official ships
they're hilarious
love those two
Tbh I can imagine those two actually like that when they get married
mae is just better at everything
yeah, but that's an 11/10 shitpost
is a terrifying force of nature
ladyblade mae
I'VE SEEN THIS
OKAY BUT TRU
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXS24FJyyHw
last echoes shitpost:
idr who i used it on
i prob should've pitchforked her
yeah
Ok maybe not that haha
Pitchfork anyone and they're gonna be strong
you try toting faye thru as a noncleric lmao
ehhhhhh
Tbh anyone reclassed is a monster
yeah mine was 3-5 usually
Each time like 4 or 5 stats, although maybe I was just lucky
^^^ same
and then he's a monster
just gotta grind a bit and reclass to gold knight i think
He consistently leveled up so well for me
yeah
conrad was mediocre
Conrad actually has insane growths
can't change my mind
conrad is the way to go
nah
ehhhh
nah fam
Did you use Mycen?
Yeah haha
too late in life too
too late in the game for him
hell no
What was his name again? Nomah?
Did any of you guys use that old sage dude?
which is like kinda ???
my catria ended up the best out of the 3
Yeah my est turned out never being all that good, palla was really good though
lmao
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAdzUsEqbDg
also, echoes had the best shitposts
Btw gene same, I actually have an echoes playlist
babysitting taken to a new level
but holy fucking shit
like damnit i get that you have great growths
fucking est
oh speaking of fliers
Haha ikr
ok
hwat
Yup
This is original claire
is that clair?!?
haha nice
i still listen to the fe echoes soundtrack while doing hw
For example Claire is completely different (and so much better) than her original
Yo if you look up a comparison between the old gaiden character designs and the new echoes character designs they sre worlds apart
lollll
valbar is on the cover
yep, bitches
lmao
is that valbar
holy shit
who dis? alm, celica, and
do you guys think they'd remake sacred stones
i mean
very different game
which tbf
never had the chance to play the original
but like
yeah
p sure the original gaiden did it
oh yeah it was in gaiden too right
it's not new, but i love it too
i liked not having the limit use on weapons
"how bout nah?"
I loved the new health for magic system
i play loz to smash pots, man
"reverence for tombs?"
Forging actually made sense for once in fire emblem
like
smashing things in dungeons was fun
Honestly despite the sometimes frustrating maps and frustrating enemies, I love what they did with archers and the new item system
that's fair
maps were eh
dungeon crawling was... barren and reliant on jump scares
game got a bit grindy at time
witches? dude, no
polished how so?
i wish the gameplay is echoes was a bit more polished, but it was solid for being everything else that it was
So I sent it over to boey
I ended up never needing it on alm's route though
I looked up tactics and all that to get that act 1 dracoshield
"nothing to see here"
like "just shuffle along now ppl"
i was trying to give him a gimmick to survive at that point
just didn't
i like
props to you man
i gave him a draco shield too, but he was useless by that point
Yup
oh damn you did the draco shield
boey was k until he was dishing 4 dmg per attack
He got sagittarius and I gave him a draco shield
the adjacent heal passive was 10/10
My boey actually turned out niceeeee
her saint reclass was heavenly
lmao mood
Hahaha
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/258/597/498.gif
boey made an ooookay mage tank iirc
lmao the dragons
I N V O K E
D E A T H
sure, it was grindy but like
Remember the dragons that ignored defense and did a flat like 33 HP?
honestly, summoning was fine
"GEE, LET'S MAKE THESE MAGIC-USING SHITS TELEPORT AROUND A MAP IN A GAME WITH PERMADEATH AND CHARACTERS WHO CAN'T TAKE A SINGLE HIT OF MAGIC"
^^^ FE:E pitch meeting
And god cantors too
"good, now teleport their money over"
"teleportation!"
"how do we get people to buy dlc?"
W H O  T H E  H E L L  T H O U G H T  W I T C H E S  W E R E  A  G O O D  I D E A ? ? ?
that can go fuck itself gently with a cheese grater
ah the earthquake
i might be remembering wrong
didn't you have to seraphim/sacred weap the big knight guard things
F U C K I N G  W I T C H E S
And the half-health earthquake thing
w i t c h e s
wait also
those fucking witches
Ugh this was a nightmare for me
shit yeah
You guys rember this level?
so salty
and then was -spd+def
she did eat all my orbs in feh
She carried me hard
I loved delthea
she was just wannabe mae
my delthea was a little monster
really?
delthea is the glass cannon that never was: leaving opponents at 1-4 HP and leaving herself exposed
lmao
clive is canonically shit
mathilda with romphaia was really fun tho
kliff is canonically a mage
tobin is canonically an archer
gray is canonically a merc
Hahaha
lmao gene
i haven't played in forever
"fine twist my arm"
bitch, twist yo neck and take a look at what's going on
oh i went mage i think
I made my kliff an archer- best decision of the game
use his eyes
his growths are nice, but it wasnt worth it
doesn't
I was so upset with my python
he jsut
python's eyes are shut
God python ugh
schendscale and the other skill can go die
python was just there for me to snipe at everyone with that 53% hit rate
double lion boissss
lukas and forsyth were just "we're alm, but slower and incapable of killing shit"
(everyone apparently)
who needs rescue lol
i had some regrets
i classed faye wrong so uh
Yeah took me a damn while to figure out
"he's not gonna kill you"
"alm go forward"
it was just shredding with alm, healing from afar with faye and silque, and using gray and tobin to clean up
isn't the trick just
so much crit cheese
alm's side was really lopsided and boring to play with
that level was an L
took me like 4 tries because Rudolf kept coming down and one-shotting my tanks
i feel like someone had fortify as well
Yo did you guys have as much trouble as I did getting through the King Rudolf's castle?
idr
did sonya get it too?
holy hell so useful
tatianna's fortify
tobin and gray were 11/10
Dude gene mine was pretty much the same
Hahaha
in this episode of never count tobin out
celica's path was "hide behind valbar, mae and leon clear shit up, genny spams invoke, saber, kamui, and celica go fuck shit up"
but in echoes archers were one of my favorite classes tbh
I never liked archers in awakening (besides Noire)
I think echoes did archers so well
like DIE BITCHES
fucking bless
bless
lol i made him a merc
and as a bow knight with ridiculous attack and hunter's volly
he works so well as an archer
YES
I first made him into a cavalier (don't ask me why I did this) and then after he became a gold knight I pitchforked him into an archer
so eff off gene lmao
boey was surprisingly useful for me until towards the end
Yooo Atlas saved me so much in Thabes
idr
at least i think his name was atlas
atlas became a monster on my game
jesse was bench fodder fite me
I was surprised by how well he turne dout
atlas was budget jesse who was budjet kamui who was budget saber
He was by far the strongest unit I had on Celica's side
My Jesse turned into a freaking monster btw
One of my favorites in the game actually
Yeah they do have a cute support
Saber, Kamui, Jesse carried celica's route for me so I never needed another myrmidon
they have a cute support
apparently she's genny's only support too
^^^
yeah
There are so many swordsmen in Celica's route already
yeah, she felt more useful
too many myrs running around already
i went sonya
Sonya
My favorite characters in echoes were Mae, Claire, Lukas, and Saber
sonya or deen?
oh guys
YES
boi
best voice acting I've seen in a japanese dubbed game
"lies... lies LIES LIES LIES"
"lies lies LIES LIES *LIES* **LIES**"
I was seriously impressed by the voice acting in echoes
yes
fucking amazing
his VA
berkut was a fucking great antagonist
and oof also celica
clair/mathilda/tatianna are my faves looks wise
i actually love the echoes char designs
let me look at the roster again it's been a while
character and design
but hmmm
my clive actually rolled decently so he was mostly useful
Clive is such a meme, never useful
okay tbh the couples in echoes are hilarious
Character and design wise
C L I V E  A N D  T H E  H U G E - A S S  M O L E
like designwise or characterwise or like being usefulwise
we need to have a serious discussion about the atrocity that is:
Who's your favorite Echoes character?
ok, but if we're gonna talk about echoes
gimme all the crit
mathilda ftw
i want m o a r
echoes is fucking great
Yesss I love Echoes
Duma's tower in Act 4 was just... ugh
that soundtrack
echoes is still the best 3ds game tho
Because I couldn't save in the middle and each random battle took all my effort to get through
they had a lot of potential and did the disappoint
Dungeons honestly stressed me out
rip
let me see shit
like boi
i want them to try it again without trying to scare the shit out of me
made me uncomfort
i love the concept of dungeon crawling, but i felt like i was playing a horror game whenever i went into one
jk
time to blackmail my sister
ah fun
march
Thabes is hell
when's 3 house's release
thabes sounded like hell
But it was satisfying in the end
i did not bother with post-game
rip
never again
that shit was horrid
managed to get through thabes after 3 tries
i just want echoes's artstyle in three houses dammit nintendo
i didn't get it either
I didn't have money to get dlc
all the reclasses
echoes is great but the dlc is like a little too good
lunatic is
let's just not
normal is feasible
hard
Did you play on normal or hard?
and chapter 18 (i think? maybe 19?) was also a living hell
Oof
nuibaba's mansion doesnt hold a candle to conquest chap 10
conquest is just holding effie and xander down at chokepoints until the end of time
Her medusa is so dumb
Also Gene I remember crying so much with Echoes actually, remember Nuibaba's mansion?
i'm just kidding with you
haha
jk
I gotta at least play one of the fates games sooo
"also camilla"
I got conquest because I heard it's got the better gameplay of the two
^^^ yup gene
and if you said "bc camilla" i'm gonna murder you
fates is just a hot mess in general
i've seen middle school students write better stories than the people made conquest tbh
What should I have gotten birthrights instead?
i'm so ashamed of u
jiayi
ytho
Well I like a challenge so I'll see
conquest is badddd
and don't let chapter 10 make you cry too much when you realize you'll never be able to beat it
have fun
cool cool
Even if it's got a bad story I'll probably still like it because it's fire emblem
i hope you enjoy plot holes and bad writing
it's arriving Thursday
Oh yeah Gene I ordered Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest
i need to get enough sleep so i have time to remember to bring smash
I feel like we have the most thoughtful and intriguing discussions in this nsfw channel haha
oh mine absolutely is
i only have time for quick ones
our personalities are nsfw
I should actually find more sexual quizzes
this is nsfw
whoops @ us doing all of this in nsfw
lol rip
translation: you trust your impulses and make bad decisions
oh, forgot this bit
ive done no hw
ok, enough quizzes for me
*taps forehead* can't dream if you never sleep
we have meetings every tuesday to cry over the futility of our dreams
welcome to the club
ahh dreamer and sensitive
me: i wonder if i have a problem
this test: wow, i wonder, buddy
me: guess we'll never know
this test: what the shit m8
talk about eyeopening
damnnn
and then you open that shit and it's bright red
the oops looks almost like the orange of the beaker
w/o opening the pic
also
lmao
O O P S
but like
10/10
i love the oops
wow
uh
hm?
uh guys
me and shopping is a bad mix hahahaha
yeah
you are quite naturally impulsive but you have more self-control than that most of the time
but at the same time the test can go can it
and ambition
there's def a good amount of accuracy
hm I think yours is mostly accurate as well tbh, the test just seems to underestimate your self-discipline
<@!193229269076279298>  also look who's the master now, bitch
and i'm not the most resilient person, but i'm not thatttt squishy
i think i'm pretty laidback, but i am pretty motivated to keep my shit together
direct is like eh for me
I think mine's p accurate overall, probably the one that fits the least is dreamer tbh
look if i put myself over others, i'd be a v different person lmfao
rip
lol
okay i call bs on indulgent
I'm like kinda shook by how low those 2 were lol but whatever it's not inaccurate
here's mine
speed through it it doesn't matter
well if you agreed you just have to finish
how do i exit
now what
lmao rip
uh
i pressed yes
oops
i am on top of my shit lmao
it doesn't affect your results it's just for their research
presses option for none of these
lmao
you realize that right
me: an intellectual with an iphone
the entire last section
yall can skip
they were like what phone do you use
it's okay
big shrugs
shit, i clicked unemployed, but there was a student option
it's not 100% accurate obviously 'cause they don't actually tell you what all the pictures mean
but i have like a veneer of self control that's holding back all the crazy hahaha
well i can be
and i'm not incredibly impulsive?
i wouldn't say i'm 98% of an open person
cuz this test is so long
which is weird
not sure how accurate this is uhhhh
lmao rip
like i picked something, got it wrong, read the description, and was like "bro, that's what i meant"
https://www.visualdna.com/
and also context is important too
also, some of these were ambiguous
agreed
cuz emotions are typically read through actions/motions rather than singular moments
the ones I got wrong tho I got really wrong
some seemed p ambiguous
I'm surprised I didn't get more wrong tbh
this was hard
oh i got 12 haha
14/20 was an L
rip
also, ive misunderstood some of the answer options
yeah
people are easier to read in action ngl
oh i did too dw
surprisingly, i feel like im flunking this emotional intelligence quiz
agreed
spirit vegetables are the true personality test
iconiccccc
I approve
tbh both of your veggie descriptions are p accurate
funny that they talk about summer though I put winter as my fave lmao
lmao
spicy af
this is the biggest compliment I've received in a long time
spicyyyyy
microexpressions anyone?
https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/quizzes/ei_quiz
this is so wholesome
wtf
how do they decide if a vegetable is introverted anyway
soooo mysterious
lmao
i kinda know what a fennel is
i'm a fennel apparently
https://farmbellyshop.com/pages/what-is-your-spirit-vegetable
THAT IS THE GOOD SHIT
THAT
if im gonna feed a test info for 15 minutes, you better spit out the good shit
spirit vegetable test
isn't there like a
but like
again, doesnt have to be related to sex
fair
we're not learning anything interesting about ourselves or others
i think that's why these are boring
it's straightforward
lol
mine were also p much exactly what I expected though so
i am not too surprised by the results lmao
I am unsurprised
hm
I'm taking a break from aggressively khan academying my way through infinite series bullshit
it's interesting, i understand it's not personality, idk how useful it is
i'm trying to redo the math review over here lol
i know it's not personality typing, but that's just the easiest term
you know what i meant lmao
it's a tool for understanding people and the different ways we think
*pls don't show up to my house to set it on fire
it's not meant to be a "personality" test smh like cognitive prioritization will correlate SOMEWHAT to personality but that's really not what it's for
it's interesting but lowkey useless
i don't like the personality typing tests either
tbh
hahaha
myers-briggs is like his pet peeve lol
<@!193229269076279298> fite fite fite
jungian typology is super interesting if you get into cognitive functions n shit
yeah
didn't know about you
i knew helen was
dumbed down and commercialized
but I hate how much it's been like
<@!472541429130854421> and I are total mbti enthusiasts if yall know us
heck, myers-briggs questions are even more interesting
it was generally uninteresting
not even that
it's not sex related if that's what you meant
I think the questions were generally quite good
it ain't spicy
I liked it
i still have my doubts about this test
and as a skeptic
but we're both skeptics
well, we're almost opposites
this one is a bit long
only if y'all have time tho
@here
http://www.dichotomytests.com/
if I get something similar I'll be genuinely shocked
looking at your results
alright one sec
id take it
so idk if it's worthwhile
but he was telling me everyone he sent it to got similar results
hmu
ooooh I haven't seen that before
link
my friend made me take this
alignment?
but what is there?
lmao
as always
I'm down
we wanna find some more tests and stuff to test our degeneracy?
takes less Ls and more zzzzs
Get some sleep as well!
night!!
Alright, done taking that L. G'night y'all
nice, night
G'night
night jiayi ‚ù§
Good night guys
Aight I'm done
She literally told me the other day she was chill with whenever
nice
3:30 am emails
I kinda wanna do my exemplar essay scaffold to see if Maners might still let me turn it in, but I really think I should sleep after sending this to Matheny
I just want to sleep
seriously
fuck woolf
I actually find To The Lighthouse interesting, but my life simply does not have time to sit down and read it (or anything for that matter) right now
O o f
self awareness and meta humor
I literally have a note added to that saying 'Just like this book"
"How trifling it all is, how boring it all is" is a line a character says
efficiency is the goal in life
This is the highschool life, finding the most efficient ways to bullshit everything
Yup I'll do that
unless they throw curve balls or only mention highly important information once (why would they do that) you should be fine
Oh my gosh, I've been spelling Mr./Mrs. Ramsay wrong this whole time
or just skim read
I would go for the beginning and end tactic
I mean, I think your health matters a lot, but you know where you are in the class best. If you need the points, you need the points. Just remember that you need the sleep as well.
or maybe I should just critically read the beginning and end sections and hope to bamboozle
how I don't miss you
ah "critically read"
I'm debating whether I should just go to sleep and accept the lost points or not
I have to critically read from pg. 84 - 124 before tomorrow....
I'm not looking forward to that
O o f
it's 30 pages long
and I'm only like 10 pages into chapter 17
I'm supposed to have critically read chapters 17 and 18 for tomorrow's critical reading check
Dude, I'm doing the essay thing right now lmao
ugh I hate virginia woolf so much
Be as open as you want to be. I'll gladly listen to you however much you need me to.
but it feels like to be a bit more
Hey, I'm always here for you, my dude
I'm generally not a very open person
Time will come on its own
I really appreciate the support
thanks
I'm sorry
the one thing I can't touch
just need time
working on it
Just because it's not more wrong doesn't mean it isn't wrong
It's important to address your problems if something is wrong
I'm sure it's not
You sure that's healthy?
for me it surprisingly is
That doesn't mean the situation at the time doesn't hold weight
not saying much
yeah that's
until I'm being carted around the city in an ambulance again we're always above something
^
Is there anything I could do to help?
also been substantially worse
been better
Everything alright?
are YOU ok? damn
oof
what I would give to exchange all my personal problems for school problems and what I would give to exchange all my school problems for physical problem and what I would give to be given 5 minutes with them
yeah I'm good gene lol thanks
I'll just do it during school fuck it
Is everything ok?
Trust me I know the feeling
I'm  s u f f e r i n g
eh you got a couple of hours
did we actually have to do stuff for physics
wait fuck
*time to spend with friends
I don't know what either of those are
I feel like thisisfine.png would be better
is the dog part necessary?
I IS HERE
YOU HAVE FRIENDS
dog?
ThisIsFineDog.png
I love having literally none of those things
My plan to have all those things starting from last Saturday blew up in my face so spectacularly that I'm still trying to clean up my over-ambitious mess of a plan
I want:
-sleep
-free time
-Smash Ultimate
-good food
-love
-friends
-all my work done
-feeling set about the future
-feeling proud about myself
We don't even get a full two weeks this year
then I'll bring up the fact that I've been on break for so long already
Why must you hurt me like this
I'll just keep bringing up that I'm on break until you guys do
Send help
it's nice
I want to go on break already, man
I'm pretty sure I screwed up data collection since my points look pretty weirdly spread out but ah well
Yes it's fun
did I hear data
Physics graph and analysis
break
Why are so many of us still awake?
Just how I like it
and at the last possible second
I'm pretty sure it's fast and violent
rip?
could have fooled me
well
really?
long?
jk
like your writing process
it needs to be long and painful
okay
oh wow
that's too nice of a way for you to go
i know it's a joke
lol dw bout it
actually sorry
Not even best game on Switch. Why should I play this trash?
yeah me too lol
hope you don't wake up
i'll believe that when the sky falls
uh huh noah
jk

fucking
you
dont
yet
you fucker
yet
noah
yet
you're all dead to me
I think it would massively improve my quality of life
yet
... fucking hell
I want to see this
do it
please
yet
fuck off noah
NU
...
can I implement a bot that add `yet` to the end of all Salina's statements
jk
he's too busy with spreadsheets to go to the gym :p
We've come full circle
Oh hey, this chat is nsfw again
i'm not your slave
You actually go to the gym and stuff right?
fuck off noah
I'm a stick, noah if we stood next to eachother there's a world of difference
sigh
slave much
you do it for me
why do I need to spell
and not spelling either
*breadth
breadth and depth not height
short and spindly
but like for a sapling
you're a stump
exactly
yeah
you're too short for that
not tall enough
I don't think anyone would call me a stick
uh hu
you're not much better
well
stick much
hilarious
you break me?
this should be fun
something about breaking you
This is something that severely hampers my quality of life
you're going down
lemme know when you wanna throw down
I mean, I'd be abnormal in other facets of my life
it is break
them's fighting words, bish
OH DAMN
and where's the fun in that
just for being `inconvenient` drop the `reminders`
then you'd be a normal person
Imagine if I had a normal person's work ethic and ability to focus
and yeah I'll look a quick look over the overview ppt tomorrow morning or something
no
inconvenient reminders
that's what i'm here for
:p
for also reminding me of the hw packet üòÇ
Alright thanks Salina
just go thru the overview ppt
Call time for the band trip is 8:20
Everyone in band laughed at me when I asked if I had to come in for first period before then
If they saw me now, they would understand why
... and vocab is 1 of those haha
and the hw packet is 3 things
I think I can get through it
there's not that much to study
well
I forgot that existed
<@!503787499605458954> you are reaching almost as much as LA teachers
good luck
nooooo
OH CRAP NO THE DAOISM TEST
bye
lmaooo
but the human condition by jon bellion is a fantastic and mind-blowing album and yall should listen to it ok thanks bye
hm?
very vaguely related
then i became jon snow
i thought i knew about the human condition in daoism
yeah well
damn I thought you said you were gonna leave like an hour ago
not you
lol daoism is keeping me up rn
go to sleep hoe I'll do it
üñï
jk
something or someone?
it's super effective
you really got to pair it with something else
salina used guilt trip
actually the feeling of constantly being hot and sweaty isn't great all the time
lmk what else you want me to do on the paper
fine
but goddamn the guilt trip is effective
true
I had 2000 jobs
bc i don't want sherm to murder us
this is a lie
do it for me üòõ
you had 1 job
thanks cindy
do I have the energy to redo it
nice
...
me
fuck
aaaaaaaaaaaaah I forgot to fix this ROI
something something energy bill
someone prob sat in it too long
rip
we renovated it
talk about a downgrade? :p
"used to"
Lmao
my house used to have a sauna
all showers lol
gene sometime I'm taking you to a spa or smth
i haven't taken a bath in a long time either
it is my first night of break
jk
giving me a knife to kill you with?
damn
I haven't had a bath in like a decade
don't worry Salina, I have better plans
Imma do that my first night of break
man a bath sounds nice
I'll probably cut my hair again sometime soon
love me some hot water
I'm getting mine cut again in a week or two
jk pls don't kill me
something something 90 minutes?
just got out of a bath so I'm good
i'm prob gonna just grow my hair out again
it's ok it'll be nice again in a few hours
F
rip hair
time to wake up early tomorrow
*pays respect to chopped off hair*
whoops
would not flip 0/10
i need to shower too lol
ok tbh my hair is nasty rn and I need to shower
Oh wait...
Hair flipping is my job, excuse you
so much crossover between cars and makeup
jk
la... bella?
*hair flip*
la glamour
el drama
it's great
for dramatic effect
I use line breaks
also when I'm telling a story
rip
nah
normally
but like
yeah
ahem the politics back and forth anyone
when I wanna look over what I say and be semi careful about it
that's all i meant
it's def text walls
kinda thing
yea I'm disappointed in the size of it
this
when you have something to say
I usually do
text walls?
and I def don't always text like that
idk if I'm even making sense at this point I'm so tired
idk that wasn't that much text
is that people who don't put an effort into their appearance shouldn't judge people for doing so, that people who like to always look put-together shouldn't become too reliant on that image and be willing to chill every now and then, and that they also shouldn't judge lazy people who are comfortable being derpy. BASICALLY do what makes you happy and stop judging everyone, if you like makeup go off, if you don't that's great too, but idk men especially shouldn't be talking shit about how women look with/without makeup because a) it just worsens the image issue and b) seriously who gave you the right
i'll hold you to your word haha
i'll grill you about it later lol
lol rip
talk to me about hospitals and drugs
I mean we all have our own biases
more intended toward image
both?
both i guess haha
text lines or image?
idk i think i have a skewed perspective on the issue
and it lets ideas separate themselves more
rip?
it's not like we have a page limit here
i mean
I mean why not
lol
I've come to really like using line breaks in typing
she always texts like this
yeah
text walls galore
too much typing
I feel like <@!503787499605458954> is building a long argument
how it does work is very different though
like genetics
well a lot is out of our control
how it should work is you shouldn't be judged for things outside of your control
principle or reality?
idk
image matters, but women shouldn't be judged so heavily
are we talking how it should work or how it does work
you admitted that women are still judged on appearance more than men regardless of success
ok the point I'm trying and failing to make
are we trying to say image matters or not?
well, noah
rip
it's complicated
ack
`when they regularly look 10000000000x worse` doesn't that just feed back into the idea that image is everything though
also lmao cindy
and it's an interesting dilemma, to say the least
my only thing is that I don't think you should be too reliant on it, like don't be afraid to show up w greasy hair and eye bags and sweatpants every now and then, you're still beautiful + who tf gave men the right to judge when they regularly look 10000000000x worse
i've grappled with it for a while bc i have enough self-image problems to feed an army
yeah
it's usually a combination
whether it's really for yourself or rather for other people
it really depends on how you use makeup tbh
rip
mechanically I don't know shit
I'm just trying to talk about it from a more social/cultural perspective and not a mechanical perspective
sorry not trying to come across that way
yall don't know shit, just accept it smh
anyways idk I just don't like when guys are condescending about makeup in general
knives
oh right
then act like a regular student
work on knives
they will try to kick me off campus if they notice
got anything better to do?
lol why not
I mean I am on break
should I just drop by
I'm so down goddamn
i have b lunch so nope
Gene hit me up
it's ok they can be wrong as well, just add them to the list
Smash at lunch next week anyone?
oh?
lol
you would get along well with Nicholas and Gabe in that respect
noah's gonna say some shit about that but I guarantee you don't know enough to always be able to tell
it's not a "mask" and a lot of times it's barely noticeable
when I say a full face I just mean like, foundation, powder, eyes, lips, all done
but yeah, full face of makeup
you could dehydrate it and bake it into a mask
That's literally what you said though
it's really not
stop calling it a "mask"
for people that do it for their own enjoyment fine, but I think that's the minority
oh tons of girls will wear a full face of makeup
oh
what cindy was talking about
like full face masks though
hm I can't really think of anyone tbh
there's def people who wear makeup at school
I don't know any girls who wear that much makeup, does anybody in our classes do that? Maybe I'm just too dumb to notice haha
` damaging to self-image` that's what I'm referring to
if you like how you look with it you do you
well, we don't really care what you think, or at least girls shouldn't
it's uncanny valley for me
regardless of how good you are
plus I think it just looks bad
it's like I know you don't look like that and you know it, so who are we playing here?
second
or in regards to a full face of makeup
like actual face masks
ok the whole face mask thing I personally find a little hilarious
that's when it becomes damaging to self-image etc imo
temporarily
and I'm not talking about salina I'm talking about the girls who can't leave the house without a full face
satisfied
it's just nice as a pick me up
happy now?
... i have a problem, fuck off noah
it's good
as long as you don't become unhealthily reliant on it
Salina "I don't have a makeup problem" Zhang
but it's still a ton of fun
and it's hardly the worst thing
I play w it a lot less than I used to
at this point makeup is my coping mechanism
idk
Persona's really popular
fair
`well noah, you don't need to get it` yea but I don't like it
I've really wanted to play P5 for a while tho
Wooahh some of my friends are gonna love this I know a few people who are really into Persona
Look, fam, I've been doing hw and did not expect this to drop
me neither
I've never played Persona tbh
yea read it on reddit
Yeah
O:
quien es?
This feels so real now
persona 5?
NEAT
interesante
YES GENE?
THEY ANNOUNCED THE FIRST DLC SMASH FIGHTER
hm gene?
hmm?
well noah, you don't need to get it
GUYS OMG
the only thing I've needed to replace has been my brow pencil
rip
and i don't need to buy anything else
I don't get makeup in general, the feeling creeps me out
it should last me a while more, but it's like pretty close to empty
it's possible
I've actually been not buying makeup for like a year now
ok to be fair
oh fuck off noah
oh but I need this
...
this is how it starts
with exception to foundation bc my maybelline one is running low
makeup
what do I win when you fail?
No buy?
i'm going no buy for a while
noah you don't get it
ok tbh
THEY'RE SO PRETTY
Np. Lemme know if y'all ever need someone to talk to.
idk I have low enough expectations that I think I'll be good tho lmfao
I don't understand this, why do you need more?
same to you üòÉ
also thanks gene
much love as always
thanks gene
i usually never buy palettes
but I'm holding back for now
Also, since decisions are coming out (this goes for everyone here), I wanna let you know that even if things don't go your way, it's going to get better. After seemingly having my dreams crushed a week ago, I can confirm that it gets better. You guys will find a place to be happy, and there will always be people to support you.
rip
I still want more
i still only have 3 palettes
I'm never gonna use them all
oh
"i can stop whenever"
I have too many palettes
I was the same for a while
^
okay yeah kinda
ok you're totally addicted
i'll buy as much makeup as i want lol
fuck me?
fuck you
noah likes to convince everyone they have an addiction
I can go without it and be fine I'm just slightly more prone to pasisng out in class
that's what non addicted people say
lol rip
keep telling yourself that
yea
ok I'm not actually addicted let's be clear
it really can be
jk
it's that bad?
the smell helps wake me up
and so has helen actually
and tbh it's like a pavlovian response at this point
cindy's seen me on caffeine
lol rip
We're here for you
but it helps me stay awake
good luck
Don't forget that
expect either the world to be burning or i just won the lottery
Ah good luck!
No matter what happens, we're here to celebrate or support you
it doesn't like give me an energy kick or anything
so if i like run out in the middle of JSA
good luck!!!!!!!
at 4 pm
I though you said caffeine didn't affect you?
damn
yes
already???
wait results??
Good luck
Oh shit
ahhhhh stanford
`I am completely unfunctional before coffee`?
dude i'm dreading and looking forward to tomorrow
And that makes me really sad
I take soooo long to do anything
yeah math puzzles unfortunately
I am completely unfunctional before coffee
I'm gonna have to take a depression nap tomorrow instead of playing Smash
like just kill me
I hate mornings
math puzzles? really?
I'm the least morning person you'll ever meet
I just suck
I used to have an alarm that would yell at me
and I make myself do math puzzles to turn it off
jk sorry noah
so it's never the same one
something something sleeping thru a quiz :p
and I keep it on random play
or ones that yell at you
my brain is not meant to work that early after waking up
they are the best
and I still don't wake up
get a mechanical bell alarms
they sound like legitimate emergency sirens
AND IVE HAD TO SOLVE YOUR ALARMS DAMNIT
is trying to figure out which alarm to shut up
Salina's heard my alarms
what gets me out of bed
My alarms keep waking my parents up instead of me so I just gave up
like at this point
at this point
it's not for shits and giggles
my ears are just immune
you talking to me bitch?
yeah sleeping through alarms is my secret superpower
why do you think i have THREE next to my bed
Good night
night
sleeping thru alarms bitch
‚ù§
‚ù§
‚ù§
you guys can't set an alarm
night guys ‚ù§
Sleep and play smash at the same time
goodnight
I've overslept w those kinds of plans way too often
i need to sleep too
i'm keeping my parents up
i need to sleep now
risk?
True
^
too much risk with sleep
nope nap
I have to perform and play in a Smash tournament
grinding
keep grinding imo
Should I take a depression nap for 4 hours and do my homework at 5AM or just keep grinding?
but I go down hours long rabbit holes for days
rip
If forced to choose, Maners would choose to kill the man in front of her rather than buy bananas haha
apparently eighth grade was a good time to start habits for me
but I have to enjoy whatever I'm doing
I commit
well you guys saw me with the spreadsheet
lmao noah
... that is really sad to say actually
should I buy some bananas or kill the man in front of me in line, no soul would be worrying to say the least
ok no I'm not like that but like I am both the most efficient person I know at my peak and the absolute worst student I know at my worst
well, at least you're a healthy weight haha
rip
i don't work and only eat lmao
i'm the opposite
whoops
keep working but like just don't eat
or maybe i have a lot in other aspects
it manifests in v unhealthy ways for me
lol i just have no
same tho cindy
just doing for doing
I would be scared of someone with no soul
rip
oh i love to draw when i don't need to compare to other stuff
it's v strange
I simultaneously have no self-discipline and an abundance of self-discipline
cindy what have you realized
all you need is marketing
art? really?
who needs soul
that's it
rice one about art
stanford one about family
i think i've poured my soul into maybe... 2 essays i've written for college
bruh you know what I've realized over the years
no soul
but the writing was good tho
good writing
lol thanks bitch
...
I really love China for... reasons
it was still kickass writing-wise
admittedly tho
... damnit noah
so the whole rice supplemental
i don't have any creative hobbies
i used to get really hung up over my lack of creativity
but you can tell when i'm just out of love with that part of the story
everything is either a success or a learning exercise
I plan to try again next year
i like writing certain fragments
I've tried learning motion graphics but couldn't ever get a hang of it in two years
same with me and writing
Yeah I get frustrated sometimes when I can't get anywhere with my editing, my motivation dies when I hit an inspirational wall
rip
tbh I think one of my character flaws might be caring too little about failing
if sometime bad happens once i forget about it quickly
I just assumed everyone was like that
At that point, that's not being aware of yourself cuz that also means understanding good traits too
i'm only hung up on long-term goals i continue to not fulfill
I not kidding, I really just never think about my past failures
MORE ESPRESSO LESS DEPRESSO
need more depresso
but I'm not actually beating myself up over it
lol rip
being too aware --> depression
i've failed fantastically on a lot of things, but i recover pretty well in comparison to a lot of others i think
and I still bitch about said failures sometimes i.e. my deca paper last year
<@472541429130854421> I've never seen anyone too aware of their faults. It's all about how you handle understanding your faults.
there is stuff that bothers me
I get hung up on other things
i used to be like that
I don't get hung up on past failures?
it frustrates my parents to no end actually
Maybe not to a big extent but there's gotta be stuff that bothers you right?
really?
move on and do better
me neither
idk I don't really <@!233062637922025472>
And no, that list isn't a confidence problem. I'm just really aware of who I am as a person.
`compulsive liar` I think falls under lying for the sake of lying, which I don't think you do
perhaps a little too much sometimes
i think all of us are pretty self-aware of our character flaws
Getting hung up on past failures is something we all get and can relate to I think
rip
again, am I a sociopath/compulsive liar? idk man I don't mean to be like this most of the time
Character flaws:
-overextending self
-inability to prioritize properly
-self-deprecatimg jokes reach a point where they're no longer funny to others
-a degree of narcissism
-when mad, really mad
-stubborn
-loud, annoying, obnoxious, and inconsiderate of social setting
-craving respect of others to the point of projecting frustration onto them
-lack of good coping methods leads to projection of frustration
-a lot of projection of frustration in general
-a few more, but I'm tired
`manipulative tendencies` we all want what we want, it's just what are you willing to do for it
L
and getting hung up on certain past ideals i have failed to realize
rip
no your stupid parents are what does that
if I'm totally honest with myself and everyone here I think my worst is just straight up manipulative tendencies
well my temper is how i dig myself into stupid holes with my parents
rip
like getting too mad I guess but you don't randomly go off on people
i have a very self-destructive kind of anger
this has made me debate my mbti personality type many times
idk
lol
I think you get mad when it's appropriate
Salina temper?
oof helen too real
rip
my character flaws that i perceive as my greatest flaws are obsession with distant future ideals combined with lack of self-motivation/assertion
takes that long?
i would go with 1) my temper, 2) how much i'm willing to sacrifice for others, 3) envy
my biggest character flaw... hmm
Lust and Wrath
But people just get pissed a lot in general so yeH
but I was thinking just in general
I mean if you wanna go that direction sure
Granted, only when she's pissed
uhhh jiayi, that is highly debatable
damn
oh, seven deadly sins?
This sounds like my mom too
anyone
I mean you don't hate your mom right?
Whose mom is this
me?
Wait
and while we're at it w the deep discussion what do you think your own biggest character flaw is
so yeah, my mom
Yup I dislike that one a lot
a certain level of self-absorption and projection of insecurities
complete and utter disregard for others
oh my FUCK that's the worst one
unwillingness to change/compromise
Your mom herself is a flaw oof haha
lol
specifically lmfao
ok but
my mom
what would you count as too problematic
Needless to say, I'm not winning that Smash tournament tomorrow with this headache lol
ah the nothing is free mentality
yeah go do hw
i generally try to see the good in people, but i'm not excusing flaws - some flaws are explainable and trivial, but others are problematic
I'm getting my late-night sleep deprivation headache. I think I should go do some homework for a few hours.
I've always viewed it as everything has a cost, so spend your "money" wisely
so basically we're all in agreement
lmao helen
i agree with salina's level of agreement on this topic
I said that already
but that's more than clear
i agree with the principle, but it's unrealistic
i agree with that on a philosophical level
barely related
I try not to look at people by their worst traits.
The only people to have truly hurt me are the ones who've only taken me for what I am at my worst.
They're also pretty miserable, and I can't help but feel bad too.
which is like
I'm talking about in general people trying to control your life
I'm not even talking specifically about gene's brother anymore
but this is my philosophy on how I think things should be
alright then we should switch topics
yeah this is not how life is
but if you want to do your own thing, and you're willing to go beyond said conditions, they should leave you the fuck alone
sure they have the right to set conditions and stuff
There you go
Idk, I just don't feel entirely comfortable talking about him like this now that it's over. It's in the past, and it feels weird to hold a grudge against one thing when he's done a ton of other things for me that have been amazing.
of course w parents and stuff you're relying on them for money
Gene I actually haven't heard anything about your brother so I don't know what's going on but if you say he's a good person, I trust that since you two seem to know eachother well
i agree with helen
no, I think they have the right to make suggestions and offer help, but ultimately it's your goddamn life and your goddamn choices to make
i think people do have the right to say to others how it should be done
just maybe in a way that would best help the task be accomplished
I'm not saying that it will!! I'm saying that it should
we all have a Mrs. Ramsey telling us to get married to the future
won't stop them
is that I don't think anyone else has the RIGHT to tell you how the fuck to do this
my point in saying that
but
lol my parents very blatantly have tried to force me to do engineering or compsci
"it's your life" doesn't necessarily exist for everyone
my sister has told me that my parents essentially tried to plot to push me out of med
But I really don't think that should ever be anyone's entire view of my brother
^^^^
a lot of times, family members don't believe in the whole "it's your life" thing
I don't think so either
He wanted me to send shit in earlier to edit (even though I gave them like a week in advance...)
i don't think he should've been that rude about it
and tbh
(the UC apps)
it's your life lmao
about what
To be fair, he was kinda pissed
^^^
esp towards your younger sibling who's obviously stressed, you telling them everything is shit isn't gonna help
Lmao
I dunno I just think it's a little cruel
if we're talking about condescending people my mom is #1
I've seen way worse character flaws
The college apps thing is about as bad as it gets
i guess so i haven't been here all the time
none of know him
to be fair
but that's just what we've heard
^^^ i'm with cindy
just because it's a coping mechanism doesn't necessarily make it okay
it seems p bad ngl
from what we've seen w college apps and everything
But I get what you mean
Eh, you could argue it's a coping mechanism
he hasn't specified anything
what level?
but that level of condescension really isn't productive in any way shape or form
look i'm not saying your brother is an awful person
mhm
Otherwise we're nothing more than our mistakes
But that shouldn't be your only perception of someone
I never said you should
i'll accept flaws, but i'm not going to excuse them
I'll accept people's character flaws as long as they're somewhat aware of them and have other redeeming factors
I don't mean to judge too fast but I'm also a bit overprotective when it comes to my friends
No that's a good point Helen
well I mean obviously we don't have the full picture
mmmh it's not simple but it's still doable
sorry i'm in a rancorous mood lately
not that simple.
but if they're condescending they can fix it?
can't really say "they can't help it; that's just how they are"
for example someone getting angry easily is just as much of a deal breaker
Yeah, exactly
it's just one of many things that can be character flaws
He just likes to bitch about people behind their backs and point out people's flaws when they're apparent
to be fair i don't think condescending is necessarily a make or break factor for how they should be regarded
no es bueno
but condescension
mhmmmm
That would make him the dumbass
He doesn't actively tell people that they're dumbasses
Bruh
you don't need to treat them like that
ahem
which might be true but at the SAME TIME
He's not perfect, but he's still respectable
he thinks everyone is a dumbass most of the time
It's a mixed bag
it seems like
hm
yeah well
He actually is tho. He's nice by default. He's only condescending when he thinks you're being a dumbass
they're..... not a nice person in my book
if they make you feel like shit about yourself
something something college apps
hmm
"when it comes down to it"
sure doesn't sound like it tbh
"just a nice guy"
like having a high opinion of yourself is attractive, I don't mind a bit of ego, but you talk down to other people and I think you're just a dipshit
that doesn't mean he should be condescending
I mean, he's still a nice guy when it comes down to it
Problem with people who know their shit: they can be as condescending as all fuck, and you can't ever win an argument
to develop some fucking EQ
and this is coming from a person who thinks a healthy amount of arrogance IS attractive to an extent
maybe he can use some of that IQ
well then
Holy shit does he know how to destory any argument
but he's def full of his own shit
I'm proud of myself but like
condescension makes a person instantly 100x less attractive
you said that about noah
you could stand to be more proud of yourself
Ever
I've never seen the boi lose an argument
not true, bitch
talk about L
.... r i p
damn
He's me but better looking, more intelligent, but really condescending
L?
OOF
Honestly, Scott's constantly pissed at everything and everyone
Nah, it's cool. Thanks tho
he must have been extra pissed
he was like a teenager when you did it
*just so we clear, i don't mean it
Lmao
Mew's come back to get vengeance
"that's why you're not getting into UW"
Oh my god
"yeah remember mew"
He brought it up while editing my apps
rip
Fair haha
He still does
Gene your brother must've held a really long grudge for that
but i was the nosy bitch that read thru diaries and shit
and my subeta acct (but i got that back)
my sister iced my first Neopets account
With a Mew on it
üòÆ
rip
I've crossed the darkest depth of younger sibling sins: I deleted my brother's save file on his favorite Pokemon game
rip
I'm a nightmare of a younger sibling
i agree
lmaooo
also lmao rip gene
i can see why my sister hated me haha
it'd be a nightmare
loool
if i had me as a younger sibling
"I still don't think this was a good idea" -my brother, age 13, commenting on my existence
i wish they did though üò¶
my parents wanted 2 i think but the others didn't happen
close enough
well you guys have dogs
sadly she only got 3
may mom wanted 4 kids
i guess i should be glad i exist?
i was basically the most strictly planned baby ever to exist
my parents had an abortion while they lived in england actually
Oof
13-year age gap between me and my brother is suspish
it just so happened that my parents did want 2 kids they just didn't plan well
I don't even have to ask
my sis and I both were
I was probably an accident
yeah I was too
Let's be honest
oh yeah i was an accident
honey I'm so sorry
walked in and immediately motherfucking backpedaled
like you don't really want your parents relationship falling apart
didn't you say you were an accident or something
oh noooo
talk about Ls
i have accidentally walked in on my parents when i was younger
but I was still thoroughly grossed out did NOT want to think about my parents doing it
ok to be perfectly honest as scarring as it would be I'd be happy for them
wow jiayi
other than my own existence i have absolutely no evidence that my parents are sexual beings
in its wrapper to be clear
no lmao like
... geez
Was it filled?
üòÆ
one of the most scarring experiences of my teen life, btw, was finding a condom in my parents' room
though I like hotels a lot
it is
it's p great tbh
so do we
helen's family uses airbnb for traveling sometimes
lol no the airbnb thing was separate
uh no
yeah and we only had in-person sessions like 3 times
that involved going to an Airbnb?
they took spanish so they had health outside of class
we took a not normal health course
you sound like you're talking about one event?
wait when was this?
lol rip
nvm
oh wait i think she did
but idr
don't think about it too hard
I'm p sure she did
Hotel beds are really awk when you think about it too hard
`your mattress` depends on the Airbnb
interestingly enough i don't think johanssen actually showed us real condoms for our class
really? what about 8th grade health
lmao rip
that was the first and last time i saw condoms actually
it must be so awkward renting out your house knowing people are gonna have sex on your mattress
well that's nice of them
oh man
fucking wreck that bitch
once at an airbnb room the host provided condoms in a drawer
but that's the satisfaction of slapping someone tho
then the world would be a much less stupid place
then it would slide off nicely and not grip their skin
if that were the case
i mean
bad ideas never stopped middle schoolers
unless you want to bitch slap someone with one
well
so seems like a bad idea
It did
middle school is the festering ground of the worst sex jokes ever
it looked kinda fun
but they come covered in "oil"
That class was weird af
ehhh
that was stupid
yeah
I remember that
In middle school, some of the people I hung out with filled condoms like water balloons during class once
I assume you can get them during the quarter as well but I've never cared to check
"hey gotta cope with the stress somehow, bitches"
awkward but effective
That's amazing
Legendary
lol
lmao
lol
BC hands out condoms for free at the beginning of each quarter
in the future, of course
while living in your parents' house? no thanks
Personal hygiene though.... so with like the toothpaste and stuff?
it has to do more
i would just buy that shit online
nothing can just do what it is supposed to do
I'll remember that haha
lol you're welcome
No I'm not actually thinking about it but you know what good to know thanks üëç
turning scottish are we?
getting poetic here
"were mine bane"?
side effect were my bane for 10 years
they're usually in boxes near the personal hygiene section
oh also jiayi if you're actually thinking about it you usually don't have to ask specifically for condoms
i guess so
side effects is like throwing darts at a board bc it affects diff people differently
but if it's not, then there's no chance it will do anything
but i'm just saying in general
mhm
if your acne is caused by hormones then it works very well
i just mean hit and miss as in actual impact on people
Cronch cronch
i don't mean actual hit and mis
Oh that makes sense
Give me all those birth control pills
lots of variance in side effects and such
not really
yeah it's hit and miss
lol
and obviously it's only for females
but it doesn't work for everyone
birth control is effective for some people
hormone fluctuations can cause acne
I know someone who bought condoms in eighth grade
hormones and shit
hormone control
mmm my sister and I both have fucking awful period symptoms but my mom insists that it's "unnatural" so I just suffer. my sis has escaped
And how does that work Helen haha
If I went to buy condoms I'd be scared of running into someone I know who works there, since you gotta specifically ask the employee or something right? I'd have to like Rite Aid or something since I don't think anybody at school works at Rite Aid
i considered getting birth control for acne before
and I will once I go to college, 100%
I would totally get myself birth control if I could back to the period discussion
it was just condoms
not really?
but I have no shame so
Oh haha
it wasn't for me
funny story
You've bought contraceptives Cindy? Was that experience awkward?
Haha
Interesting!
aromantic is def a possibility
Interesting!
possible aromantic?? idk someone mentioned that to me at some point, I honestly don't know much about the labels, my opinions on love are basically if it happens it happens and we'll see where life goes from there, but at least right now, I'm perfectly happy never committing to anyone
but yeah for the record I think I've finally figured myself out and I'm very bi
mb
I was under the impression you meant the rice purity test score
in this episode of TOO MANY SPREADSHEETS
Ooh you're talking about that
sigh
what are you talking about?
shade
lmao wow
I have a 73% Noah read your own spreadsheet correctly haha
yep
I think
voyeurism
that made no sense outside of your stats
we are talking about Jiayi the man with 89% Salina
i'm the opposite haha
but I dunno idk if I've ever had a legit crush
huge "just kidding"
well
and
then I actually started experimenting
someone wants the info
I thought I was asexual for the longest time
lmao jiayi
I've never wanted to be in a relationship
haha
Ooh give us more details?
You've said you've never been in a relationship so I was surprised to see the sexual stuff checked
nah I barely knew them
key word romantically i think
well
but didn't hold hands with them?
1st time? summer after fresh year
first of all when did you kiss someone
ask me anything
well
No Cindy I am really curious
such being sent to the office for doing something wrong or ingesting alcohol
you're welcome
this is definitely more information than any of yall ever wanted to know about me
i feel like i've probably committed vandalism but i can't remember
I missed a couple of things in the test the first time around
turns out mine is 4 points lower than I first got
2 points higher right? nice haha
not that I mind lmao
going through I only got 58
oh huh maybe I fucked up when I took it
oh ok
oh so we're not guessing anymore?
fill out your own result
no this is just data mining
looks like noah is filling out his own
Also what point is there in filling in our own scores in the spreadsheet if the game is guessing haha
<@!193229269076279298>
wait how does this form work
or for us to fill out our own
is this for guesses
What is O-Week?
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WVdc-6BHQtQ6dx1deGp8wuDX6QEyaXrrXmB3HjEdc_4/edit?usp=sharing
we're derailing lol
anyway
We can ask her whether she thinks highschool sex and drug use has gotten better or worse
which was like the post-cultural rev era
me
which maners... is not
if I make a spreadsheet who is willing to fill it out?
so if we want ppl who have lived thru it, it'd be around their age
...in china
our parents lived thru 70s
she's about the same age as my parents
Cold War was still a thing
I remember her saying she graduated in the mid-late 80s right?
I mean 80s is close enough
although she probably has better context than we do lol
she's not that old
We should ask Maners
point taken though
ok i never lived in the 70s
Oh, also, average marriage age is increased 10 years cuz no one dates
inflation 10/10
take a look at the 70s
lemme make shit jokes in peace
well people are getting richer
i'm joking with correlation/causation
bruh you think this is bad?
Ok, drugs, maybe not
drugs really?
so like
To be honest that sounds believable, if colleges started expecting purity from their applicants that would happen
and I'm p sure teen depression is rising
high school sex, drug use, and pregnancy rates are already at an all time low
TIL sex/drug/pregnancy prevent depression?
uh L?
lollll
Higher is better
Effective in 2028 for people entering middle school next year
High school sex, drug use, and pregnancy rates drop a shit ton
Depression unexpectedly spikes
America has existential crisis
stop capitalizing shit, noah
Rice
just put a purity test as their app requirements
ah fuck off noah
party college anyone?
Salina does that help or hurt your chances of admission for RICE?
probably not lower...
depends on colleges
Some colleges should do that for April Fools
higher or lower being better
Oh my god that would be golden haha
O_o
Imagine if the rice purity test was considered for college admissions
lol
i'm fine with starting off, since mine is pretty much the easiest haha
yea but then you're best off guessing everything
SAT subj test does haha
the sat doesn't deduct for incorrect answers
Haha this should be the new SAT
what is this, the SAT?
you can take it as far as you want
+1 for correct, -1 for wrong?
so we just get back a correct answer score
Can I send mine later? It's kinda late, and I don't have enough hw done
how about this: we send our guesses for each person to this chat, but you don't have to reveal which specific parts are correct if you don't want to
Although if people aren't comfortable with that we can all do the scoring or something individually and just put in the percentage similarity in the spreadsheet ourselves idk
**:bar_chart: are you participating in this**
I'm cool with giving you my breakdown
which I don't think everyone will
I can't really use it unless everyone gives me their breakdowns
I'm down*
I'm done
in that case, point taken
are you going to do stats out of this?
takes too long
and then what? manually score each one?
we could just check the boxes off on the original test and send screenshots as our guesses
so no one else would have to see your score
yeah no one HAS to
Just sayin'
*template bitch
I don't think we should force anyone into this who doesn't want to tho
I could just make a template and give it to each person
mine is even easier
mine's pretty easy to break down ngl
it'd be interesting, to say the least
I have nothing to hide tbh
this can lead to some major üçµ
but I'm down
kinda awkward
I'm down
Yeah
It's really easy to guess people with high scores
although it's difficult if you have a lower score
No
that sounds fun
oh boi
oooooh
I kinda want to make a spreadsheet where we all try to guess another persons score breakdown
lol that counts as 20% of my results
I'm retaking the test more carefully
Although I realize I missed a few, like "ingested alcohol in a non-religious context", I missed that one
mmf nah
does it count as cheating if you were never in an official relationship in the first place
true
so there's like nothing checked off post-that
That and everything after that just gets more and more extreme
Thing is once it gets to 35. Cheated on a significant other during a relationship?
jumped the gun a little I take it
Does that count?
I've held my own hands together romantically
when no one is good enough
lmao
fun fact
lol I never checked off held hands romantically
rip?
I haven't had a perfect score since I was...three
Oh yeah that actually makes sense
^
Be a ten year old
You've gotta be like a saint or something
How do people get perfect scores?
Average score is 62
jk
brbbbbb
lmao
idk what to tell you
have double digits in this
hIGh QUalITy
ok if you don't
Here is a high quality visual of my double digits
Because why not
what can I say
I'm a trendsetter
I don't know why we're posting photos of a single number
Or 96 I guess
Cindy this is why we have 95
K, fine, I have a 96
Well
lol
yeah they do
uh
And being aware there are people
No one takes off their pants at a party and spins around while peeing
like justin bieber level on the street kinda shit
It probably means actually in front of people
in public in public
What else could they be looking for?
It doesn't?
Well you know it doesn't mean that haha
Oh yeah
Or off the side of the road
On a hiking trail
...
No like
I think peeing in the restroom doesn't actually count as peeing in public
lmao rip
I was basically just asked how sketch my neighbor was
Being a sex offender probably drops you down to like 60 even if you've never done anything else
not because i've been a criminal lmfao
but it was after i got bitten by a squirrel
technically i've been questioned by the police
Look, it's perfectly normal to pee in public
wait idk how your scores are so high
i mean
Gene you're a sex offender
I have talked to firefighters more often than police
I dropped 1 point a year or two ago cuz I got "questioned" by a police officer
I think my score has stayed exactly the same for four years
Nice
Higher
actually reading more carefully, my score is a bit lower lol
and apparently 77 is the very bottom cut of "pure", lucky me
Did you expect higher or lower?
I looked up a "score level" sheet
I'm very surprised Cindy gets a 56
Hahaha
holy hell how is that possible
and was like
i read that as 97 at first
Ayyyy same
Ayyyy
95
Nice
Especially since the numbers are all based on self reports
I think it's fine if it's linear
Oh
not rice
bdsm test
no for the spreadsheet
Honestly, if you have a 0 or 10, you're probably dead
which doesn't feel right
because currently person one having 0% and person two have 10% the difference is treated the same as person one having 90% and person two have 100%
but he's trying to make the "point system" make sense
should I scale the 0% - 100% logarithmically or leave it as it is
basically calcing compatibility
being an idiot
what are you trying to do
but I can have some help here with the math bit though
76
I have a 95.
It's not because I have the self-control to avoid bad coping mechanisms.
I just don't have time and thus lack all forms of coping mechanisms altogether.
but I'm not sure about that scaling
so I want to scale the 0%-100% logarithmically, as in 0% = 0, 50% = 250, 100% = 1000, then divide everything by 10 to get back to the original 0% - 100%
h o w
i'm a boring person haha
i still have a 92 lol
hopefully not cocaine
mine has gone down
lmao
also you got 58?!? ._.
it's not a percent
dear lordy he needs to stop
My rice purity score is 58%
bc he now has too much time for it
spreadsheet shit
actual math help or spreadsheet shit
@everyone math help needed
Ageplayer    Ageplayer
Boy/Girl    Daddy/Mommy
Brat    Brat Tamer
Degradee    Degrader

Voyeur    Voyeur
Switch    Dominant/Submissive (0.75)
so is this the final list?
I don't remember my score despite having taken it 2 times in the past, guess I'll take it again
oh boi
good idea
oooooooh
<@193229269076279298> obviously finish the compatibility thing first since you're working on that, but once we're done, we can try to see how our Rice Purity scores correlate with this data
you can change them and it will live update
and select the dropdown for names
go to the compare sheet
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EFVxm0Bz53-ECcskQDL8qQWMvW8PL0RShs4N9RYTfOA/edit?usp=sharing
you guys basically have the worst possible score short of each person having 0 or 100
no one cares
Oh fuck just realized I was trying to take the test on school network
good times
lol
you are 993% different
damn ok I was confused as hell
OH
the lower the score the better
you didn't
I plan to ask everyone to take it a total of 3 times and average the results
how did we get so high on similarities
dw bout it
wait then
oh i retook it twice
How much would you hate me if I retook the test and got drastically different results
lol rip
you're top she is bottom
the compare tool is up and running again
I'm guessing the ones in the middle were most similar
I scored fairly high on sadism, her on masochism, a lot of ours were opposites
I'm p sure I scored highest on dominance and emi scored highest on submission, for example
no I'm just surprised bc at first glance it looked like it would've made sense as a compatibility chart
in a lot of cases they are opposites
but as we have been over, compatibility and alike are different
really??? huh
that graph represents who you are most alike to
was that similarities or
so for the "compatibility" graph you posted earlier
it was so much nicer when I could just subtract one array from another and just absolute value and sum them
but yeah 75% also works
Dec 6 - Jan 2
god damn
yea
eh I've been through better and worse
are you on break already
wait what the FUCK
how'd they go
till Jan 2 I have off
oh lit
just finished my last final
I was thinking 75%
take care of yourself tho don't waste too much time on these
was going to say that but it seems kinda low
makes the most sense to me
50%
well I plan to do it based on a points system, so what percent of the Sub Dom match should a Switch Dom/Sub get?
switch CAN pair w either but if you're a switch you enjoy both so ideally you'd find someone who also enjoys both
and shouldn't switch also be able to pair with dominant and submissive?
shouldn't experimentalist pair with itself?
yeah exactly
non-monogamist pairs w itself
experimentalist is kinda its own thing
switch pairs w switch ideally
exhibitionist, voyeur I would also say pair w themselves
vanilla pairs w itself
`Non-Monogamist    Experimentalists` also this isn't a great pair either
and Ageplayer pairs with itself
so switch should pair with both Dominant, Submissive, and Switch
exhibitionist and voyeur aren't a great pair either
exactly
Switch and vanilla don't pair
... damnit i thought we agreed that switch and vanilla don't pair
but I need more people's opinions before I go try to go code it all
Ageplayer    
Brat    Brat Tamer
Daddy/Mommy    Boy/Girl
Degrader    Degradee
Dominant    Submissive
Exhibitonist    Voyeur
Masochist    Sadist
Master/Mistress    Slave
Non-Monogamist    Experimentalists
Owner    Pet
Primal (Hunter)    Primal (Prey)
Rope Bunny    Rigger
Vanilla    Switch
closest thing me and Salina came up with was this
which can be good or bad, depends on how it relates to the the other values
the current chart just finds the differences between people
anyway the question is, if you wanted to make an actual compatibly chart you would need to decide on opposites for all kinks
so not too bad to add more people now
but over 95% automated
let me tell you it was a bitch to code
how intellectual
so the big chart just represents the totals
of people
for every possible combination
so x36
this chart is for Salina-Emily
ah
imagine this chart but the absolute value of everything added up
the bdsm data??
all the data you guys gave me
which isn't really who you would be the most compatible with
what is this based off of
currently the chart represents who you share the most in common with
What's the debate about
need to reach a consensus
Uhhhhhh oook
we will poll later
Rip?
so I would disagree
I don't think most people are very smart
Most people would disagree lol
but me and Salina would disagree
this is what Gene would call a `c o m p a t a b i l i t y  g r a p h `
well I'm back again with more charts
I'm pretty sure I do
u have no right to be lol
I'm so proud
jk
when you can't converge on the dick
LOL
this alternating series failed the virgins test
but it's impressive to say the least
What can I say I like what I can see
i'm not judging
talk about no shame
90% voyeur wow
thanks for the data Jiayi
thanks Salina
Friends are fun
it's fun to have friends
but it's so entertaining
i need to leave this chat and do work
i need to stop talking with a certain dork and get some sleep in
yeah kill me
i read that as "it's becoming a global problem" i'm like yeah sounds about right
sorry you should be able to edit it now https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EFVxm0Bz53-ECcskQDL8qQWMvW8PL0RShs4N9RYTfOA/edit?usp=sharing
it's becoming a gradual problem
we're still friends
usually not for long but like yeah
jkjk
>:o
i have been falling asleep in class left and right
>:o
>:o
yeah
üòÆ
is that sAlInA???
i see what's happening here lmao
"noah noah" comparison
proof of unconsciousness
Yes you do Jiayi
I need to take this test
not being dying inside
this is elaborate
Oh
i need to like
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EFVxm0Bz53-ECcskQDL8qQWMvW8PL0RShs4N9RYTfOA/edit?usp=sharing
go to the compare sheet and select the names from the dropdown and it will make a graph for you comparing the people
fair
you sleep more than me in deca
Perfect
I like don't sleep in deca tho
deal
"a whole ass ib mood"
i can nab cindy in deca
titled
dedicated to this
dear lord the class is a fucking snore
we need a legit fucking photo albm
i'm like falling asleep in reinsch's class so much
at the end of the year I'll make a post out of them
I'm surprised Ramsey even let us sleep that day
take a pic whenever you see me fall asleep at school
Gene it is done "mostly"
my picture was from early february
bro I have like 6 lazy sweatshirts that I just cycle through when I have no more fucks to give
just the o: of judgment
lmfao
the judgement I'm dead
that's amazing
you're literally wearing the same things both times
omg peep fran's face
OH MY GOD
math last year
How old is that one Helen?
we need a channel/photo album just for cindy and jiayi sleeping
holy shit we're wearing the same clothes
Oh my god üòÇ
old receipts this took a hell of a long time to find
a subconscious soporific effect at this point
math literally has like
yeah I downloaded it at some point
I think emily has a picture in class of us sleeping too
`to be fair that wasn't in class`
lmao
smh
hahaha
i ship it
to be fair that wasn't in class
Yay!
F
also warm fuzzies bc friendship!! and sleeping-in-class solidarity
well, what I got out of that in that case was a chance to ramble about one of my favorite subjects for like an hour
lmao
oh wait I DO REMEMBER THIS
I can't remember when, but you did like look through your notes and summarized them for me in a lecture form
the battle buff
lol
ah wouldn't be surprised WW2 is my SHIT
i'm willing to listen to problems and be emotional support for a while, but after a bit i acknowledge that you gotta get your shit together and i'll be more about pushing you in the right direction rather than just letting you wallow
Emm I think it was WW2?
Yeah you did
I don't even remember LMFAO
I still failed the test, but it was nice
wholesome af
I did?
I remember one time you helped me study for a Doran test in the library
talk about tea too often??
"Several people are typing..."
like that I do what
üçµ üí¶
Cindy I like that you do that
S P I L L  T E A
tea
educated guess
oooooh
How did you know
Damnit Helen haha
but that doesn't mean I'm not willing to listen to y'alls problems any day. Not the most wholesome or touchy-feely person but I try to offer practical solutions whenever possible, like if someone I legitimately care about needs help I will drop everything for a while unless it would actively harm myself
i hope you don't mean that literally
That's true, I've met some pretty awesome assholes
1. you're not an asshole. trust me.
2. assholes can be good people.
lol I'm not a particularly selfless person, like I'm v generous with my time, energy, support, love, even money, I consider myself a pretty compassionate person overall, but ngl I do always think like what's in it for me in the back of my head. never gonna be one to forget myself in the service of others, and I don't really mind being objectively more of an asshole than a lot of you guys
i like how whenever we move to nsfw, it becomes less nsfw
I definitely agree
idk
it doesn't just come down to whether or not i can/can't
there's an extent to which i'm willing to deal with the same problem with tolerance and patience and whatever
don't we all
i just have my own policies for helping others
idk
As long as nobody is getting hurt, I make sure I'm happy
I have a very similar viewpoint as helen
i help people when it's a person i know and it's something i can reasonably help with
jk dont answer that
to what extent?
but at the same time there's an extent that i'm willing to help others
i prioritize myself always as long as i'm not harming anyone else
i will almost always help others
I'm not as good of a person, not gonna do it just whenever I can
i only prioritize myself over the people i love when i know it's for their long-term well being or it's more pressing
I put others first when they need it
disengage
there's a point to just nope out
or at least, i shouldn't
but i know that i can't destroy myself over other people
i will put others first when i can afford it
lol rip
second is people I love and then I guess I kinda care about the rest of the world
but my standard is me me me first
ok it depends on the situation
there's a lot of lower things below on my priority list
cough climate change
Shoot wrong channel
but helping yourself is just as important
What is one scientific fact that people have denied for a long time in history?
i'm still p selfish
people i really care about are 1a and i'm 1b
helping others is really important
self-care and self-love are important
but it's really important to not sink yourself with others
it's ok to be selfish sometimes
i think i'm a pretty selfless person when it comes down to it
i mean
Put yourself first man
just gotta put those who mean the world first idk
but you get my point
sorry bad references are bad
if you can't love yoself, how the hell you gon love somebody else
cant find a happy medium, so i'll settle for statistical means
ok mood
i go back and forth between loving and hating myself
it's dumb
it doesn't make a heart emoji on mobile
Less than three
<3
love yourself first
‚ù§
‚ù§
banishing you from this channel
too wholesome
love y'all
so help yourselves
but my care for y'all is free
idk about y'all
trying to work on spreadsheet dropdowns and talk ok
guys
Love how you really moved the car discussion to nsfw
then I thought bdsm
ok first I thought senior care
jk pls don't kill me
`care prices`
and you're unaware of proper grammar and word choice
<@!503787499605458954> ok here's the thing most people are very unaware of car prices
draw what you want from it
so idk
"There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics"
is it helpful if I give you this quote
What kind of conclusion am I supposed to draw based on them?
I was referring generally to like all of them
do you mean this one?
well find it then
I have been requested for a grocery run, I will return to this later
you had like 40,333 of them
the graph
post what again?
I need to see it
I can't remember which is which anymore
post it again
i don't even understand the significance of the "average difference" graphs
Like Salina has
Oh I plan to make it so you can average multiple tests
agreed helen
this is a disproportionate amount of effort poured into analyzing some very shoddy data
good grades are good too
yeah well
I am but arguably spreadsheet skill are going to serve me better in the long run
finals are calling and you're frolicking amidst the kink spreadsheets
ftfy
*quite like being a degenerate idiot
... you're an idiot
because nothing gets me to work on projects quite like it being finals week
reformatted and moved to separate spreadsheet, automating E V E R Y T H I N G
your boi hasnt slept since saturday
are you still working on this
what the fuck
<@!258094439636008971> we're getting close
Wow I'm going to be late for school looking at all these graphs
night
G'night
Anyways, I gotta sleep
I forget what Salina's looked like tho
Wow, you're not last
because they're all divided by the same number
it will still be the same shape and order
I didn't convert it to percent because it doesn't do anything to it
Get some sleep
But also like
You could take the similar categories and see what percent people had from those they had of the max from those categories
Or if you wanna be particularly degenerate
yeah
you want to see what percent of the maximum possible each person has?
because this is an actual percent graph
normalized for 100% on y-axis
so combined percent/"points" scored on test divided by combined percent/"points" possible
i meant percent possible on the test
that's not what i meant
bumped me a place up
nope
you're clocking in lowest for sure on that one though
to get an actual percent
you should use the total and divide by the total percent possible
which btw
not percent kinkiness or whatever
i meant how much we deviated from the group
oh, i know
you're just looking at the Delta from the average not the total
holy what what
actually Cindy clocks the highest at 1213% total
emily clocking in at >600% is p crazy. 2/3 of the group over 400%
basically the percent is just treated as a number of almost everything
wow, that's intense
%
what unit is the y axis?
this is the total deviation from the group average, so adding up the total amount you deviate from the groups average
is it a  c o m p a t a b i l i t y  g r a p h ?
gene you gave me another graph to do
you are going to have to open the original if you want to actually read it
welcome to the ib life
i want you to  s u f f e r
just adding you adds another six charts do to, plus redoing all the original ones as well
your time and health come first
which requires I sort them as just values
lmao im just kidding, man
ie, large to small
so much of it is manual work to make them look nice
I don't know
you gonna add meeeeeeeeeeee?
lmao
and just pin that
yea I'm going to put them into one giant photo in a bit
dude, if you just pin one of them, it'll take you to the spot in the chat, so they can read all of them
c o m p a t a b i l i t y  g r a p h s
difference
from most to least
are they difference or similarity?
ok
got to reupload
out of order
wait, are these similarity % or difference?
Thank you, Noah! Very cool!
i t ' s  a  c o m p a t a b i l i t y  g r a p h
F
and that explains why I take the bottom three spots
I'm not sure how to describe it best, but notice Salina, Helen and Cindy in relation to each other
p sure im the basic one if anything lol
cuz everyone else
yeah
no actually it doesn't
wait no
it means you basic
somehow I own the bottom three spots
Ahahahaha
so hard
I'm going to murder you
<@193229269076279298> so just to piss you off
lot to do
comparison graphs
ok now the fun stuff/hard stuff
I'm most proud of the percentage bar graph, getting it to rank from highest disparity to lowest disparity look some thinking
cleaned it up significantly
see you tomorrow maybe assuming I don't die/skip
me too <@!503787499605458954>
best wishes to you
start being productive
lol I'm off to
night guys
yeah im going too
i'm off to sleep too
g'night
good night ‚ù§
Goodnfith yell

they're more quiet about it around 70 tho
how they gonna be 18 and still be throwing papers around and messing around in class DURING A LECTURE
never
When do they stop being loud and rude
but they still dont grow up
around 70
I cant wait for me n.....
just never
when do they stop being so Loud
idk what the context even is
i saw that notification and came here to answer that
I hate that
never
at what point do men grow up
I cannot wait for college when hopefully I'll see better men
idk if I should be proud or sad that the category I take up the most of is for owning sex slaves
I have the most for ageplayer and non monogamist and idk what that says about me as a human
the purple and the green is v hulk-esque ngl
lmao
this looks like an art piece
agreed
Sadly.....fax........
all the guys at skyline suck
i love zoe's view on the situation
if men didn't exist i would freely walk around the city at night alone
lmao
If only there were men around
shemurrface
And its senior year
Committed relationships are work
aw thanks
Very cool
Cinduuu I like your profile pic
I have like no desire to be in a serious relationship
but it makes sense for me lol
I'm confusio
I think I scored pretty high on that one too
Why an I so high on non monogamist tho
Yeah
isn't that...expected?
isn't that normal
idk
i mean
This kinda wack
I wouldnt cheat on anyone either
valid???
reasonable???
i mean
I'll end myself if someone cheats on me

why the hell
Hes fine
that's what error bars are for üòÑ
bc he's concerned he might have data errors
noah wants to know if everyone can double check their own data
oh my god hes a really bad boy hes a really bad boy oh my god hes a really bad boy hes a really really really really really bad boy
I napped, did physics, and then wrote my jsa speech during tok on Friday instead

Sad!
im not in there
no there is
they're not ordered in any way
?
but there's no correlation
the fall off of kinks basically
^
It's showing like the progression of %s
there's no data in between
they do make sense
what even is the x axis?
they make no sense whatsoever
line graphs
the
using
fucking
stop
thank you noah for your service
someone please death me
afraid of death? DO THE DEATH
exposure therapy
Really doesn't bother me anymore though
death doesnt sound too bad rn tbh
Like big time
my bladder is beseeching me
I used to be scared of the dark
whats the worse ill get? death?
just OVERCOME
s a d  b o i  h o u r s
fear is subjective
irrationally
RETINAS
CONES
im just scared
yeah i took 3rd grade science thank you
reflect
the concept of not being able to see anything
l a ck  o f li Ght
im just scared of the dark
i dont need explain
do the big explain
<@!460689096646590465> this is your thing
rip
but im scared of the dark
except i have to pee
im not talking to anyone
who is?
hahahaha
let the him s l a v e a w a y
he's talking to jeesoo
i've officially become the interpreter bc he's too busy doing his data shit
nnn is over b i t c h
gladly
noah says go fuck yourself
g o o d
slightly?
you've annoyed noah slightly
MORE DATA
YES
go jeesoo
YESSSS
this is a strange test
wow that was quick
>:D
>:)
add in your data
but bc i feel like being an ass rn
"but not really"
throw in your data
i may just be really in touch with the kind of person i am
noah says
yeah it's a clear cut for you
i mean
go hard or go home?
man you definitely have the most focused results
honestly reminds me of the dolls from the early 2000s
üòÉ
the name is just weird
yeah
brat just means playful/rebellious sub, it's not anything bad
<@!193229269076279298>  have fun
i assure you brat was 98 last time or smth lower
no just mild differences
oh ok I thought you meant like dramatically different
yeah i took it three times lol
oh god no
like have you gotten dominant before or
i will GIVE MORE DATA
don't feed <@!193229269076279298>
really?
oh boi, more data
big brother is quaking
i get a different result every time
damnnn
<@!193229269076279298>
wow
enjoy bitch
here's more graphs interjected
that two-faced cumsock has 2 arguments and i can only find one

jk gene we love you
I'm trying to

I'm disappointed in myself too don't worry
i want to die

shoot for the moon
you dont nut on the 25th sometimes to pay respecc
lol
^^^
rip
yeah
I don't think it's supposed to be possible
and you need to dedicate all 24 hours to nutting
i don't think it's supposed to be fun
by then you dont even have an hour to recover
no youre jsut dead
is it even fun at day 31
a public service
thats a commitment
it's a service
yeah around day 12 it starts getting bad
the world needs it anyway
forceful population control

thats a lot
or just go around collecting genitalia that too
w h at
^
nut the amount of times that the date tells you to
thanks
let's go
got it
okay
hell yeah emi
that works
but sure
I think she was asking for specifics
i go out and castrate people
so like
the name says that clearly
ah
destroying dicks
whats the objective of DDD
okay i know we discussed this but
I'd have to clean it up to add more people
jk you're great don't kill me
my data analysis is too messy
WOULD BE ABLE TO ADD MORE DATA TO A CHART
and someone who's good at organization
it's also the first google result lol
well the link is pinned if you're interested
a true claim must be able to withstand changes in data
dw it‚Äôs lost somewhere in the depths of my documents
deal with it noah
nooo then I need to add the data
also
hit us with the results
go emi go
join the party
oh hell yeah
that's why we were all so confused lmfao
i have a screenshot of my results from the nsfw test
LMAO
i don't think so???
you're welcome
rope bunny = is into being tied up during sex
tl;dr you like being tied up
i dont think i want to know
i dont even know what that means
I made these kids take a kink test lmao
are you actually 98% a "rope bunny" lmao
R U N
hi emi
helen
wait
i  think i'm more of a switch than whatever it says
this is the chart I think people are thinking of
I don't think I'm that aggressively dominant
fairly
i do think i'm a switch
speaking to everyone who took the test
hmmm
about how accurate do you think your test results are?
<@!193229269076279298> love me
good to know let's stick to bromance
real talk
see, feeling's mutual
OOF
i wouldn't be into you either
platonically
rejected üò¶
I love you tho
LMAO
sorry
eh
I've known you too long to be into you
kidding
if salina wasn't straight.............. üòâ
that's some really limited data we're working off of
granted, it's abhay's crack ship
loool
that's a ship in a jsa chat actually
lmao
basically:
chart = diff between ppl on each point --> differences
add up total of differences
vs avg difference --> avg on how diff you are
jk
cindy x salina i ship it
because first off that would be awkward on many levels and second the data didn't totally match up
I know it wasn't
no, not compatibility
let's just assume it was a compatibility test to make him feel obligated to explain
wait <@!193229269076279298> come back you were supposed to explain
help
if (noahTalking == true)
{
         Destroy(noahComment);
}
send
he doesn't fucking shut up on this end hahaha
you think he talks a lot?
but like
yeah
I assume he and salina are chatting away as usual
lol
he's not actually talking in this chat much
someone do it
damn
lmao
LMAO
helen's better definitely
someone code a specific button or command to shut noah up at any given moment
what's up
i'm aight
who is good at cs
yep
as he does
noah is overanalyzing the data
hmm
heyooo jeesoo
earlier today I made people take a kink test
hey jeesoo
like noah, you're great but your working commentary is annoying after a while
wtf is this
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-wPvnXKQgBHYJBKPxYdKnlzoUhuUWpsxAL4upASkkVo/edit?usp=sharing link if you want to look at the data
I am interested in said data
he won't shut up about data
i'd be more than happy to be wrong
yeah
noah, how bout you explain this yourself
are you and noah in a call btw
it really isn't
no it's not
lord
it'd be the nsfw version of when everyone shipped their friends in middle school unironically
I doubt it
lmao
compatibility oh no
i dont wanna know
Compatibility? Lol
What is this chart for?
what is that
don't mind me, still working on this
'cause like I most definitely do NOT have my shit together on so many levels yet I'm not panicking about it even when I kinda want to be
Same
rip?
I feel like I'm more stable emotionally than I have any right to be
yeah no not an emotional mess
I think I would benefit from being more of an emotional mess
Although that applies to some extent
logistically?
rip?
No not an emotional mess
i would argue that being a hot mess is a good sign that you have some semblance of emotions
eh rip?
And anyone who exists I suppose
dude cindy check the debate chat pls
I'm more of a mess than anyone here thinks
mhmmm
....
(though idk if you know how much of a mess)
rip?
yall know me well enough to know I'm a hot mess
to most people
ok granted I feel like I come across as far more competent and put-together than I actually am
üòõ
lol
dun dun DUN
what if she just wants you to think that
but helen
I think you're pretty normal
I hope not
you're not
again, wondering if I'm a high-functioning sociopath
a concern
but I've spent a lot of hours wondering how far off normal I am and if it's like
*cough* parents
yeah we definitely all do it to some extent
that's how you get a bullet to the head in a dictatorship
you don't usually wave a red flag around
if you know you're being manipulated
or if anyone does tbh
common sense
to an extent yes, but at the same time
I don't really care if you notice
heyo helen
are you talking about yourself
i think we all do it to some extent
Hi I'm back kinda
they just don't say anything
i think some people notice
eh
so yay?
this is like the most I've talked about this ever
other times that level of manipulation is super super intentional and I've yet to see someone notice, just casual things like prompting them to do something but then making it seem like they wanted to anyways, extremely useful but idk, I'm rarely proud of that kind of thing
like i'm willing to help you but also do you neeeeeed to tell me about when your 14 year old cat died?
i don't mean it like that but i also mean it like that
take your life problems and like leave pls
im people too
hi, guys
like
ahhhhhHHHHHhhh
what is it with people
dude same
dude ok sometimes shit like that is almost subconscious for me, I really try not to do it bc I'm not sure I like that side of myself, and I don't around people I'm comfortable with, but like. It's had awkward consequences. random people I've known for like 5 mins will just unload their life story and problems onto me and idk what to do with it and half the time I don't even know what I said to get to that point
hit your sales goal and then give 0 shits
just gotta sell the shit
kinda different, but in the same vein i guess
i rarely use those skills on people around me, but i have them
i got really good at getting people to talk while working sales - same kind of detached feeling when it came to impact lol
I dunno I think I might have problems
and I felt bad about it afterwards but at the time I was super detached from everything, I remember just being like "hmm guess that worked and this didn't"
idk basically in the case I was talking about I flirted w a bunch of people at a summer thing because why not and because I was curious how people would respond
i get what you mean
no, no worries
not any of you to be clear or anyone you know
ok that sounded really bad
I dunno I feel like I can be pretty callous, the reason I started thinking about sociopathy was 'cause I realized at one point that I'd been like. toying w peoples' emotions just 'cause I could, and I was like, wow that's fucked let's maybe not do that again, and then it was like, how fucked is my brain really
rip
that was one of the arguments
probably cuz i play saxophone tho
rip indeed
rip?
i was trying to convince them that "if someone here is secretly a serial killer, it's ______," and they did the ol' switcharoo on me
i could see it too
I would be surprised but I could also see it actually
mostly band people
really
i've had some people tell me they wouldn't be surprised if i were secretly a serial killer
tbf a lot of lie a fair bit to our parents
hm
or be a sociopath in 10 years if you think no one is
oh damn
who's most likely to secretly be a sociopath?
rip
but like 50% of what I say to my parents is bullshit tbh
brings up a good idea
actually
I'm pretty sure that's not the case
there was also a point where I wondered if I was a compulsive liar oof
no
there was a point where I wondered if I was a sociopath
do we have any more fun categories?
lol sorry no
uh no
Be the next hitler
uh
me
i think grammar.exe stopped working
i have a surprisingly large network of people who like me, so i could do large-scale social manipulation pretty well
whomst then
noah
Cindy no you're not
bring in the finesse
you gotta be cutthroat sometimes
but also. people
That's probably true
'cause like I like being straightforward
you prob are
I both enjoy it and really don't??
yeah
not to be rude or sound like a bitch but I'm pretty damn sure I'm the best manipulator here, like I try not to do it often but I totally do
<@!472541429130854421> 9 and 7 btw
it's a huge part of figuring out how to help/teach people
i have other parts of emotional intelligence that way me down (although it's p high)
like i can tell people what they need/want to hear to help them
and you don't HAVE to use it to manipulate
Separating the two categories
true
and that's part of emotional intelligence tbh
So how would we rate ourselves emotional and logical intelligence?
good job
that's social manipulation
i just usually don't
i know how to tell people what they want to hear and how to get what i want
i'm not cindy level but i don't think i'd undersell myself in this dept
so that's why i bumped myself over average
i think i'm a bit more aware than most people expect
tbf, i'm not manipulating people 24/7. that's just bad social manipulation
I'm not aware of these things which is why I'd score lower on emotional intelligence
a lot of room for manipulation
and some of the people who do like me really like me
i'm p aware of who does/doesn't like me i think
I can't think of anyone who ~outright~ dislikes me but I know a lot of people who definitely dislike me
strategically align the the forts you hold
Because I know they exist
Which puts me on edge
I don't know anyone who dislikes me
you only gotta win the right battles
eh
but social manipulation is like a war
i agree with cindy
ok, true
social manipulation
*most
ok not people aren't overt though
I'm just not bad
i can think of like 1-2 people who overtly don't like me
nah helen you're decent
lmao
Emotional intelligence üòÖüòÇ
Off the charts wow
it depends
emotional intelligence i'd put myself 7, maybe 8
oh?
i get an 11 in social manipulation tho
I agree
lol
thanks
yep
ok tbh I'd score myself a 9 on that
cindy takes the cake on emotional intelligence
it should be its own thing
but I know I'm not wrong lol
emotional intelligence is def a factor ngl
this is kinda why I didn't want to do this at first
u ain't wrong
eh
i don't think emotional intelligence is a factor
I feel bad saying that oof
lmfaoooooo
he chooses to turn it off sometimes
he admits he can't write for shit and emotional intelligence wise.... sorry man
it requires a lot of energy
his brain has a switch
yeah
taking Ls in other departments
yeah, we probably shouldnt include others here cuz they're not willingly in the convo
but he's also like
Noah's super smart in general, v logical, I admire his arguments a lot of the time, and is like years ahead in science and math
noah wins intelligence for sure then
Mostly among us I assume
or are we just talking among us?
who wins the other categories in the server?
I would agree
that's... questionable
Salina is hands down the most book-smart person here
reddit has many typos
That's why I gave myself large ranges
v tru
tru
llmaooooooo
depends on kind of intelligence
lmao
he contains the knowledge of millions
the man is reddit
He also gave himself the highest intelligent rating
wouldn't be surprised
Then Noah wins intelligence by default among us
Attractiveness: 5
Personality: 6
Intelligence: 9
which, i'll accept having the lower intelligence marking, cuz i was the only one dumb enough to continue on and do IB from that group
i think the group averaged out and gave me 5/6.33/5.5
geez noah
at my best I'm like an 8 or 9
makeup glowup
what she meant was
Attractive: -5
Personality: -1
Intelligence: -2
at my worst I'm like a 2
ok granted I relate
4-9 wow
4-9 lmao
that's a p big range
wow the ranges are real
6/9/7
attractiveness 7/10, personality 8/10, intelligence 8/10
Attractive: 4-9 
Personality: 7-8
Intelligence: 7-9
Attractiveness: 6
Personality: 7
Intelligence: 7
in x/y/z format
order was: attractiveness, personality, intelligence
yeah
I assume you meant physical attractiveness
personality, intelligence, and attractiveness?
go at it but don't be mean and don't be modest
hmm
ok sure rate yourselves
i'm aware that it's not 10/10
I read it as rate ourselves lol
sarcasm
no your self awareness is definitely not 10/10 sorry
Did you say rate each other?
so many pins
selfawareness 10/10
oh my gosh
yeah pretty much
that's p accurate
i think i am both too nice and too bitchy
I think I'm an asshole
but objectively who knows
so like I think all of you have great personalities
I like this comparison more
we tried expanding it to more friends, and one of them shot us down
bc we're friends
and also I'm obviously biased
we understood it was all fun and games, and no one ever scored lower than a 5 on anything
and idk how brutally honest I would be
that could go SO badly
i kinda wanna do that but at the same time OOOOF
see I don't wanna do that bc it might make people feel bad
damn
o o f
dw i scored lowest on two of the three categories lol
that's kinda brutal tbh
Wow we need to do that
damn
bar graphs too i think
While taking the test I at first felt very sure of myself but became more and more confused
i remember one time in our other friend group, we rated each other on attractiveness, intelligence, and personality, and noah made pie charts
lol
which may or may not be true we'll see
ooh a switch
ok that makes it sound like I'm an exhibitionist
like what's the worse they can say about me
It's pretty fun actually
I kinda enjoy being open about this kind of thing
yeah me neither
idc that much
sure
when y'all get famous, noah's gonna be posting this shit
i mean
eh
that's what you think
no it's still fun and games haha
it's all fun and games until Noah tries to do data analysis
Very lmao
v v questionable
"questionable"
and questionable data analysis
it's just for fun
The first time, Vanilla was my highest but partially because I answered some questions backwards
I mean I'm 90% sure we're all virgins so it's not like it's gonna be the most accurate thing in the world lmfao
brat/brat tamer/predator/prey are always v flexible in my results
yeah same
The first and second times I took it I got very different results
I know my results are pretty off
sigh
noah says something about don't interpret it that way bc it's fishing for an answer and "that's not how you do a test like this"
well
unsure why, probably just didn't answer completely no on one of the more ambiguous questions
lmaoooooooooo
25% of the age play is currently you
I appreciate this chat
well, again, I'd be willing to try almost anything once, the only ones I would flat out refuse are ageplay 'cause uh pedophilia much?? and like. sexual slavery shit, that's..... just a bit too far for me, I'm not gonna let my sex life affect my actual life that much
this chat is an atrocity
that's atrocious
what is that grammar
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-wPvnXKQgBHYJBKPxYdKnlzoUhuUWpsxAL4upASkkVo/edit?usp=sharing here people join me and Salina
I have like meh results that do a nosedive after my two main score bands
You and Helen have the most cumulative %wise
Lmao
omg
I'm
did you seriously
i took one look at it and was like "nope, i have no clue how to answer this shit"
To an extent, it reveals things about people
It‚Äôs an intriguing test
carry on, noah
Besides
ah, i understand now
Also 5. He‚Äôs avoiding studying for finals lol
It‚Äôs not supposed to be explainable
Bc it‚Äôs Noah
several thoughts:
1. what's with your obsession with this test?
2. what's with your obsession with graphs?
3. fuck you for reminding me about my AP stats class
4. why the fuck would you use a line graph?
but hey, i'll come in with the switch haha
jk
does that make us subs then?
it's just Helen and Cindy dominating
And also rip
For bio IA lol
unless my near future is impending doom
I also need to buy onions
never in the highly relevant near future
Rip
my mind is either in the present or in the very distant future
i don't think that far
The hw for that night looks a bit annoying
I need to start WR notes for tues
Go do ittttt
urgghhhghhghhhhhhHHHH
jawejnvzjeaiwuawef;nzds i need to do my physics ia stuff
No u
the weak among us must be cleansed
Still not gonna try
could be once a day
what if we made the rule just nut every day
Idk
Rip?
like yea, normal Sunday afternoon here
who does 30 nuts regularly
what if the rules of DDD were changed
like man that would be terrifying
Lol
`DDD is more effort than NNN` I'd be scared of anyone it wasn't
DDD is more effort than NNN to many of us
because everyone else is going to drop off after a few days lol
lol
he'd win by default
he's probably not going to try specifically for DDD
k
I could see jiayi doing it for the first like, wee
My money is on him
Jiayi
i wonder who would try
idk if anyone's gonna try
but yeah I don't usually masturbate anyways and we're 2 days in w no nuts here, so like.......... I think I'm out
lol
but it doesn't matter
yes it is
Free will is a lie
ish
yesish
it's all up to you, not fate
Or just being a fuckboy
sounds like a robotic lifestyle
Oh dear
assume nothing, do anything
Savage
Lolllllllll
never a great plan
assuming you can get laid
Lmao
not during
after finals
after
dammit my pin is at the top üò†
Jk
Fuck away the finals pain
seems like not a great idea
so idk
I have finals
yeah idk if I'm gonna do it
I‚Äôm not even gonna try lol
Everyone‚Äôs gonna fail it anyway
Who needs DDD
that's making it hard to access the DDD sheet though
ayy
Oh dear
wow we get 0 positive votes
nah
do it
Idk
should I pin all of them?
maybe if you answer neutrally for all the dom/sub questions that's what it gives you
yeah lmao
50 below for the rest
55
100
Yeah it‚Äôs like
Lol
I'm mostly surprised that you got 100 on switch bc you scored so low on like half the categories
ik
it is, it all is
that's the point
this sounds overtly sexual
a bitch of many capacities
I‚Äôm a versatile bitch, what can I say
it's so her
i'm not surprised
but that's part of what makes it funny
no
you're surprised?
Lol
WHAT PART OF "NSFW" DOES NOT PARSE
I'm exposing salina this was too funny
OMG
this is like every mbti test i've ever done
because of a lot of things I'm very eh
i think i tried too hard i'm taking it again lmao
I selected neutral on a lot, which really lowers your overall score
which is true, I'm not a super sexual person in general tbh
p sure I didn't score higher bc I said I didn't have a lot of fantasies
I think the one I relate to most is experimentalist though, I'll try anything once, I have the least hard nos
Bc it‚Äôs the most kink specific
Mine‚Äôs not too surprising either tbh
why does my result stand out the most üò≥
I feel like my results are not particularly surprising lmao
that's the first "specific" one that been on top
the first time i took it i got a lot of vanilla so i redid it with more vigor
interesting
Wow rope
idk how accurate this is but yeet
ha that's not the goal on my end, plans to make bank
Bc it‚Äôs a dent in my dignity
I better put a dent in your savings
But I‚Äôm a costly bitch damnit
Depends on the client I guess lol
But like 25k is good
I mean maybeeee 10k
25k sounds good
I mean
I mean........ are you offering
`Well
You‚Äôll have a pay a LOT`
you've said that before but you didn't stick to it last time
reading this chat is distracting me from actually finishing the test
Fuck off
I‚Äôm not gonna be a hooker damnit
you'll need the versatility for your line of work
Lol rip
the first time i took it i answered some things backwards lmao
Laughs in versatility
Idk
damn
how the hell did you get 100% on something
i'm retaking it
I'll start lol don't be ashamed
no post them on your facebook
i'm also wondering that
Post the results here
Do we just like
I have no idea how to answer any of these lmao
lmao
oof
good idea
Should we pin it?
.orgy
.org
lol I love how it's
yeah that thing
just bdsmtest.org
https://bdsmtest.org/select-mode
talk less people
I don't feel like scrolling
yea
Link again
ooooh
<@193229269076279298> I'll spam you with texts and dms
I‚Äôll go take it
i did
did anyone actually take the bdsmtest btw
Nsfw is a place for being open
Lmao Helen
please don't spam mine, I already don't check it
if you send me memes i will print them out in color and decorate my dorm with them
Too wholesome for this chat
I'll still wanna hear from y'all
Agreed
Guys, please spam me when we're 60
e
wholesom
noted
<@472541429130854421> deal. You too.
I died 16 hours ago
@marshmallow pls spam my inbox in college
About -16 hours
na one foot in your back
Yes
yuh
Wait til I start spamming you guys in college
have you ever thought about how long you think you're going to live?
One foot out the door
lmaoooooo
Too late
lol 2 kinds of people
yeah fuck all of you I don' t enjoy your company
Hey, guys. Don't leave me.
that is also true for being a senior citizen
everyone you enjoyed the company of is gone
He's such a great guy and was 11/10 wholesome
it's the pain of being a senior
I miss Simon so much lol
lol
<@167457958211354624> can confirm
In band, Ducich was tenor sax father and Simon was tenor sax daddy
Lmao
I'm p sure we did call him daddy ducich at one point
sure
exactly
whoops
*daddy
maybe don't say that in  the nsfw chat
my father
I love that man
Lmao I remember Ducich
but I don't really remember the reasons
at one point Ducich convinced me it shouldn't be legalized
fair
Revised career plan to make it NSFW: I open a jazz and game cafe that doubles as someone here's brothel while I'm unaware and developing games my office and Alan is serving tea
i don't know all the nuances about the complications and stuff but as a general principle i think it shouldn't be outlawed for being immoral or whatever
but I don't think I'm a fan of locking up human trafficking victims
i know
yes it is
*is
that debate it super complicated
the industry just needs to be regulated
oh man
I'll need 2k
i think prostitution should be legal
<@!472541429130854421> L
Not as excellent as my body
I ain‚Äôt selling myself cheap
you do
i'd need to be paid like 1000+ a day
And I have a good body ty
The price of my morals is high
If it comes down to morals and my body
What?
Salina needs to find a job that makes more than 25k per "service" to justify it
Jk sorry Noah
money is money
He‚Äôs already a ho
am I supposed to be ashamed
Hot taek: <@193229269076279298> ends up becoming the hooker of the group
Lmao rip?
yea but a cheap one
i agree with that
I will probably end up as a hooker way before she does let's be real
Geez Noah
My bad ideas are nsfw
like for Salina in 20 years it won't be nsfw
if your work is being a pornstar i think these definitions would be very different
PErSpectiVE
All a matter of ahem
so like some people I guess it's not nsfw
gore, that makes sense
not safe for work
well also like gore
doesn't that make it a euphemism
why is it that nsfw refers almost exclusively to sex-related stuff
Rip
as in it is work related
pretty sure this is sfw
Considering alternative career paths: I open a game/jazz caf√© in Bellevue where I sit in the back as a indie developer doing my own thing while going further and further into debt and yeah this is a bad idea
Rip?
Every school I'm applying to from now on: "Why here?"
Me: "You have enough prestige that I might able to transfer out of you to USC"
sexy
My kink is getting into USC SCA
lol
I thought this was your first time you said
i remember i've done this before
kinda hard to miss "let's test the kink out of you!"
I know what it looks like
i'm already stuck at the third question
no I just searched it and it was the top result
fair
not when there are jokes to be made
>: (
never
give the benefit of the doubt jesus
maybe it's just an easy google search
bookmarked it much
my result: perfectly smooth eos lip balm balls
that was a fast link
https://bdsmtest.org/select-mode
idk what was the poll party one
the poll party one?
but the results are funny usually
serious lmao
is it a joke test or a serious test
nope but i am now intrigued
wait have yall taken the kink test
die
`break you` kinky
if you're the fourth wall how do I break you
....probably anyways
I'm kidding I'm not that kinky
lmao
the fourth wall
scratch that,
i feel like a fourth wheel
I have mentioned how much I like knives üòâ
omg
oh I see how it is
blood play, noted
just let me rest tbh
am down
if you ever feel like slitting my throat though I
...
I'll pass thanks
why does this feel like an awkward threesome invitation
Yeah come join me in kicking this bitch‚Äôs ass
happily, join me and Salina for sparring over the break
I can live with that
come at me bro
maybe it's just a cursed name
so then you won't have any cindy's in your life?
I welcome death
Lmao
why do I need to murder all the Cindys in my life
lmaoooooo
It was lol
In Noah‚Äôs case
Well
it's burned into my memory
no fanfic isn't just about bad porn
<@!503787499605458954> watch yourself
Lmao
except I hope it doesn't start with "____ was horny"
i just deleted it
uh idk how to respond to that
two seconds ago
in fact i just got an email about a fanfic update
the more you know
loool
<@!503787499605458954> you like dying that much
i don't know about noah but i certainly do
brb i'm on a quest to find it
yeah and you have a lot of experience w bad fanfic right
WHYYYYYYYYYY
DAMMIT I THINK I LOST ONE JUST NOW
Chapstick, not pants
"i take off the pants" sounds like something from a bad fan fic
I have many and I know they‚Äôre everywhere in the house but when I need them I need them pretty badly but can‚Äôt find a single one
They‚Äôre like bobby pins for me
i just saw "i take off the pants" and i was like "wow nsfw is actually being used for its intended purpose"
I think you should just be using pants in general
Noah
and then they are lost until I use the pants again
eos are probably grossly overrated and overpriced but i don't care because for some reason i cannot get over them
Can I have winter break yet?
like I take off the pants and forget to take out the chapstick
oil just serves to trap in the water
it's the water that matters
oil by itself doesn't make your lips smoother
I lose so many in pants pockets
They‚Äôre harder to lose
^
you need to moisturize your lips (i.e. put water on them)
so my lips are usually kinda chapped
I lose track of chapsticks so often
no it's fine lmao I don't wear chapstick/lip balm enough
Oh I like the EOS ones
after a few hours
sorry that sounds like an insult
dry them out
how
worse?
I feel like they make my lips worse
they're cute but I kinda hate them tbh
well if you have a bag not as much
‚ù§ ‚ù§ ‚ù§
‚ù§
they're super impractical but i just love them
We do need an NSFW channel
oh, I always liked how easy it is to use them but they really don't fit in pockets
THESE THINGS
so it's valuable
na it lets you avoid it if you want to
yes
Like I get the joke value
EOS lip balm?
Do we need a nsfw channel then?
Except whatever the dumb flavor of the month is
we're highschool students
My ideal type is EOS lip balm
na we have lots to talk about
Maybe cuz we just don't have nsfw stuff to talk about
That‚Äôs the fun of it
Lol
we do
We derail fast
general chat that is often nsfw
I love how our NSFW chat is basically just another general chat
sorry i'm cringing at myself lol
they're gonna me-me yo ass into the ground
And stay relevant
Mocking/sarcasm
so hip
I'm trying to be hip with the kids
It's sarcasm text
It's a meme or something
SpongeBob sarcastic chicken meme
camel case taken too far
it's like
lmao what is that capitalization
lOL HELEN
rAzOnEs EsTuPiDaS
LiAbIlItY
like come on schools
why can I go buy it off a shelf but I can't be given it
but it was like mostly to keep people alive bc painkillers
lol
It was entertaining
She also played drug dealer for a while
that's the first time Nichola's friends met me, I skipped out on French to come see him during lunch and give him drugs from my tin
lollll
Ik I was just about to mention that!
I can't French
Des... Uh... Drugs
remember when ram's nickname was drogadicta
Las drogas
"drug box"
I don't even carry chapstick. I leave that shit at home lol
I appreciate noah's drug box!!
with black electrical tape so it doesn't explode
so that large
mine's just an old altoids tin
gotta be prepared
i keep school stuff, chapstick, and a small first aid kit on me usually
No; I barely even have a lip balm
Like I get the need but holy shit how does that fit
I use a messenger bag and keep it as light as possible always, but still
Do you guys just carry first aid kits?
I have literally the bare minimum in my backpack
:p
everything else can stay
the bandages obvs
hmm
one of these things is unlike the other
lmao
and the constitution
and alcohol wipes
i also have ace badnages
for dumb reasons
I probably should carry advil or something but I dont
along with claritin and other allergy drugs
unprepared
lol I'm like
drogas
rip
i have 2 bottles of motrin inside my backpack at all times
ont go to nurse office just ask any female
I had never gone to the nurse's office before this year
lol
same if you have cramps
hence my padded tin of drugs I carry everywhere now
me neither
Oh right
WTF I went to the nurse's office the one time I had a cramp in sophomore year and they didn't give me painkillers
I know, it's stupid
I always forget that though
no yeah they're not allowed to =/
like why
Heat pads are those water thingies that you hold against your stomach, right?
you need a fucking doctors note
they never give me painkillers
w how many times I've gone and begged for either painkillers or a heat pad
the school nurse probably knows me way too well by this point
i have really minor cramps, but they still exist haha
lol congrats helen
m e n
smh
Ok, guys, y'all are gonna hate me for this one:
17 years without period cramps
I'm kidding
so idk
I've never really hated other people that have gone into remission
fuck you
hey helen
Doctors hate her: find out how to avoid cramps with 4 simple tricks
I do realize this topic has already flown out the window
Girls here will hate me for this but I haven't had cramps in two years
Cuz I really shouldn't all things considered
Idk, I'm probably making something out of nothing, but I look at my parents' marriage and just wonder how I came to exist
Although I think that one's more normal
I do both
My dad thinks everyone loves him and my mom thinks everyone hates her
rip?
My mom throws hissy fits at shit and my dad is the "this is fine" dog
I do both at the same time
example?
diversity is goood?
My brother has the same thing. Just super conflicting personality traits
So either way
Ok, but I'm raised by both parents
become the person you want to be
nurture over nature
That's me. My personality is a genetic mess.
You ever look at a couple with two very different personalities and just wonder "I can't really imagine what their kids will look like cuz they're just do different"?
rip?
Maybe my mood swings are so intense that I don't notice other people's anymore
yeah same lmao
oof so much random crying
once i started crying because i dropped a nacho chip on the ground
mood swings
just like
some people do act differently some people dont
Like I get that people are in pain, but people act normal in society somehow (aside from occasional mentioning that they're in pain)
i hate it
i almost passed out
IT HURTS SO MUCH
I've never noticed this
i literally see stars
YES
Do people actually act differently on their periods?
bruh cindy you know when people bump into your boob in the hallway when you are on your period
like I don't really act differently
i used to not have any symptoms and now im literally death
she turns into a BITCH on her period
plus it keeps changing anywahs
no matter how much ecperience you have you cant get used to it
physically anyways
but yeah different symptoms and less misery
you cant ever really deal with it
and still sucks just as much at dealing w it
^^^
but she has different symptoms
my mom is still bleedin
mine still does
well i mean menopause is a bitch
Do you guys' moms not have periods or something? Lmao
asking for a friend
idk if it was common
death
or like when ppl eat curry or osmething else very heavily scented next to me
ooof
my mom gets mad at me when i get nauseated bc of her food but i cant control it
when im on my period suddenly rice has a strong scent and it makes me gag
i hate citrus
dude citrus
ohhh I've gotten that a few times but it's not like a regular thing
like when im on my period and someone cracks open a tangering 6 desks down ill almost vomit
kind of like morning sickness
like when you have an extremely heightened sense of smell and suddenly everything smells terrible to you
probably not if I don't know what it is
wait what <@!271149039020408843>
Rest in arthritis
actually a lot
well if we're talking my body seeming like it's trying to kill me yea I can
Can humans just evolve asexual reproduction?
cindy do you get like scent sickness when youre on your period
I mean not really? idk obviously you can't relate
i would have killed myself 83 times already if it werent for advil
not talking to you gene
Yes
am I supposed to agree <@!503787499605458954> ?
No infections there
Counterpoint: our mouth is technically a hole
being female just kinda sucks overall tbh
it just so happens that this part of you have a giant hole in it
immediate infection
but expose a vagina to like 1 thing
on everything
Noah, you're not really fragile
oh, our body really likes to maintain a balance
it hurts more when you punch it
dicks I'm pretty sure are more "fragile"
Really?
uti
0.001 pH difference?
fragile?
Yeah, SAGE was doing a thing to donate tampons and pads
also why are vaginas so fragile
Maybe we should try being reptiles
yeah I know
its a huge concern for homeless and impoverished women
if we could hold it in....or like...if it would be clear or.....it wouldnt be painful at all....please,,,,,,
be a problem
like
like back in the caveman days wouldn't the smell of blood
same why do we need to do this
it feels like someone has stabbed your abdomen open with a dull knife, then reached their hand into the wound and is playing around with your internal organs like you would play with slime
don't understand why nature thought this was a good idea to begin with
ok i just
Of all the things humans have evolved, you'd think think we would've evolved the ability for all 100% of us to not regularly leak blood
yeah talk about Ls
damn
more like shit, im lying in a pool of my own blood
Only, "shit, where was my alarm"
yep
shit
and youre like
you know that feeling when you wake up
unfortunately thats not how it workls
Bruh
I wish
Except for me. My voice is a very interesting voice
lol my brother was like "wtf just hold it in"
is fucking terrible
scrubbing blood out of everything for a week
All biology does to us is make our voices sound scary
ive ruined so much underwear
I'm sorry, guys
if it was like clear or something id be less annoyed albeit still in extreme pain
can it not be blood when you are on ur period
and oxygen
need that sweet sweet hemoglobin
bc
why is blood so highly pigmented
23 kids and counting huh
this is the least efficient and least convenient way to do things
why does biology punish us for not having kids at 13
but wow i've never been hit that hard
my cramps got worse after i quit tkd and started getting a lot less exercise
there's gotta be more effective ways to do this
internal death
help
evolution
fr though why is this still a thing
damn
cant we just reabsorb our menstrual linings tbb
normally its just me curled up ove my desk and groaning
oh shit
cindy mine isnt THAT bad but ive collapsed before
bruh same
illl bleed through a super absorbent in less than an hour
ive also got really bad cramping and heavy flow
like curling up with a heat pad, eating enough advil to poke myself in the arm and not feel it, never wanting to leave my bed kind of bad
terrible
i got lucky with it comes to side effects
r i p
yeah
do you get bad cramping
Nsfw anyways. Nothing is tmi
but my mom won't let me
I've wanted to be on birth control like since it started
but I don't really care
this is definitely tmi
and mine are unusually bad on the physical side
medical accuracy, I think that's Salina's territory
it does
Again, shouldn't it depend?
it still hurts like a bitch
no way
it's like 1-2 cups max
lol
get out of here w your medical accuracy
periods are not a fun time
i gain weight during then suddenly lose all of it once im done
but like yeah
it's not actually liters
for some reason
cindy same
whatever
hyperbole
I'm pretty sure it's not liters though, I don't think we make blood that fast
Hot take: periods should be used as blood donations
it's kinda freaky
dude I noticeably lose weight after a period
over like a week
also liters?
well I'm not exactly in the mood when I'm shooting blood so...
To my knowledge, DDD is not about being in the mood
Also, the irony in all this is I'm having like a 3000-cal meal right now, and I was talking about this maybe killing people
idk about you but I'm not in the mood when I've got liters of blood pouring from my vagina
Periods are less bad for some people than others tho, right?
496 total, should you have to make it back up?
please...?
we should
idk
no?
do we get a period break
I feel like you need a very specific person if you wanted this to actually work
*checks this chat*
What is this degeneracy
well some people do like that
ye it'd be really fuckin painful
also your skin would get so raw
why
but like
theoretically possible depending on your refractory period I guess
yea
and that's assuming that's all you do
and like not sleep
you'd have to start at midnight
after 24 you wouldn't even get an hour to recover
yeah
you'd have to space it out all day
good luck
I mean.... if you wanna dedicate your whole day to masturbation
12
its ok until like
I do have dec 6 - jan 2 off
There was that one guy who died tho
idk, I think it could be done
you might die
I don't think it's physically possible
not many
who actually succeeds ddd
i emerged victoroous for nnn
Is the rule for DDD to try to nut as many times as the date (though it becomes impossible pretty quickly)
<@193229269076279298> I was trying to add edit components in Unity when you started talking about this, and I couldn't click on shit because the area you can click on Discord notifications is way larger than the little notification itself. Ask <@261949028994908170>. I was complaining about your degeneracy the whole time. In hindsight, it's hilarious considering your guys' topic.
glad you have faith in me
thanks katya and cindy
noah literally some of us have bigger priorities
omg
very much worth it
$2 a month for 100 gb
._____o
since I started storing everything on google drive
when did you become the spreadsheet police haha
oh my god
also <@!258094439636008971>, <@!105508293522264064>, <@!271149039020408843>, <@!460689096646590465> still waiting
so you don't get points for going over the set amount per day
you can't pace it
nuts the most within the rules
tbh all my bets are on jiayi
just who ever nits the most wins
no penalties
jiayi
<@!258094439636008971>, <@!105508293522264064>, <@!271149039020408843>, <@!460689096646590465> you guys need to finish the nnn sheet first though
Also are we penalizing for going over?
ie, I have work to do and want to procrastinate more
I'll write an equation that checks it if I feel like it
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WDHUvZt15W1URB7MFLVrSomdUn34Dyk6xhRySe-L2lg/edit?usp=sharing
of course
Are we trying ddd?
but not for that reason
well you are
you're not crazy
<@!472541429130854421> am I crazy or did you delete a message about ddd?
"perfect" haha
Balance is Key
yo i got a perfect score of 0
@everyone finish filling out the spread sheet so I know who I can poke fun at
Happy December !
lollll
auuy
ayy
yes
did u make it
nnn is over
i saw the notification pop up, and i thought this was the college apps chat
Last four hours and eight and a half minutes of November!
no news, just a general assumption
where is the news about the reunion
what
If you actually remember to update every day
Honestly NNN is a really good way to keep track of time passing
these are the dark times
we're entering the final days
talk about intellectual lol
she has transcended
so I was like eh
helen is on another level
but we stopped following the sections a while ago it seems
lmao wow
oh I was confused as well
lmao
wait I literally just realized helen put this in nsfw because 2069
what I mean is I'm not going to go out of my way to go to a reunion
like, even for 10-year reunions
apparently reunions are typically pretty sad cuz you find out how many people have passed away since high school
i think that's kinda the point
I feel like it really depends on where I am in 50 years
40%'s not too bad tbh
90% of my friends are in ib or cp
I honestly don't know 60% of our grade
tbh I would definitely skip a general class reunion
*sets reminder for December 31 2068*
"Skip high school reunion"
our 50th high school reunion is in 2069
holy shit
then yes
if that‚Äôs how you interpret it
is this an analogy for how hard it is to fill out the spreadsheet
https://twitter.com/hiyokochicken34/status/1066120498117992448
I shall update it rn
I saw wondered that as well
wonder if that was a mistake or if she's planning something ominous
she did leave Nov 30 open though
If I can make it this far I can make it till the end but you don't seem me prematurely filling out my sheet
‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
It is the epitome of TRUE CONVICTION
Yes she can
like I can kinda get filling out the day currently taking place, but yours is a bit much
I don't think you can do that
um <@!278660908212027392>
That's fair
@everyone remind me too never rely on you guys to update something regularly; if at all
jiayi: -27
reminder @everyone update nnn log
I'll have to just be more active I see
Rip Gene
Tea
Oooooh
Noah, everyone left an hour ago. You no longer have the ability to ruin my life.
So Gene how's No Nut November going for you
Necessary information to survive NNN
I have no idea what's giving me this desktop notification but thanks real helpful
but when is goes it really goes
fine
I can say BC is much more calm at times
then why do we have a separate college chat
college is nsfw <@!472541429130854421>
let's move out of the nsfw chat
i had me a good laugh
my mom was telling me she thinks any skyline ib student can get into cornell if they do early decision
honestly tho
USC seems hella lit tbh. even if it's IB-level, at least it'll be fun. i doubt it's this hard tho
`I've heard from literally every skyline ib graduate that college is far more chill than this hell`
what people in question?
well one of the people in question is at USC
my parents have unrealistic expectations of the college process
oof x2
from a negative perspective
that's how burnt out i am
oof
it could just mean that skyline students don't get into difficult colleges
i dont even wanna do supplementals for my dream school anymore
ok yeah depends on the college and the program
USC
I cannot wait to get out of here
but cuz it's swim or die for me these next two weeks
depends on the college
not cuz i want to
nah I've heard from literally every skyline ib graduate that college is far more chill than this hell
im gonna go ham this weekend
i haven't done college app supplementals in like a week
cuz that means im fucked for college
which is bad
i think i burnt out of high school
i've been doing the same reading for like two hours
gene good luck tn
oh man
I missed the main lecture, it was an L
i havent even opened my backpack yet
üò¶
also I've been staring at the econ textbook for like half an hour and I still dont understand shit and our test is tomorrow
fat mood
im everything tired
emotionally bankrupt
im physically tired
im mentally tired
im emotionally tired
mood
i am emotionally tired
not a good time
my joints flared up today and oooooooof
im very mostly tired
hopefully not having to deal with joint pain
mostly tired
and very tired
done with life
you know by senior year they will be like us
i'm like 110% pure
I love them
yeah all of ours are pure af
depends on the freshmen
depends
rip
....
it's high school the freshmen have already done worse
I know I said I wanted to know earlier but like I was mostly kidding
it sounds like that if they're in jsa, their innocence is gonna get screwed over p fast
jsa children lol
also we all know his gf too so details are just awkward
cause I would not
would you want your young impressionable jsa children to know exactly what you've been up to
bc there was a bunch of freshman
if you wanna brag do it, if your embarrassed why mention it?
why only spill part?
i mean, if we need this to be nsfw, here's some food porn:
we don't know much more
lol
nuff said
basically he used his girlfriend as a human plate
ya assume nsfw
we were literally cooking shit
we are in the nsfw chat so I don't know how to take it
<@!258094439636008971>
and I was there
I didn't even see you that day
`one time he vaguely mentioned his girlfriend + nutella and we all grilled him but he wouldn't spill` this can be taken a lot of ways
lol rip
ok but it wasn't satisfactory
I roomed with him for my first con, rapping Eminem in the hotel room with him was a cool start to JSA
y'all should've bought them from french club when i told y'all to
no he spilled a bit
basically uh
one time he vaguely mentioned his girlfriend + nutella and we all grilled him but he wouldn't spill
if y'all wanted nutella crepes
?
I still wanna know what exactly they did üëÄ
Juan Diego from jsa
It qualifies
This is food porn
Juan D? full name?
Juan D, what an icon
the best things ever
Ya
nutella kink
omg sal remember juan
is highkey reminding me of the salt chat
nutella Schneeball
make a shit ton of food sometime
talking about nutella in a nsfw chat
tbh helen you and I need to get together and just
you know
Im sure there's recipes
Let's make one
*cake
We need a Nutella cakr
`why are you so invested in this` cause I have to be of it doesn't work
+ nutella crepes, nutella croissants, nutella variations of every baked good I love
... wow
half an aisle of just nutella products
and there's like
go into any grocery store
Nutella needs to be featured at our next group outing
no, I was not present when people fought each other over nutella sales, but like.............. nutella is a part of french culture now
been there, nutella crepes are the best
Crap now I want Nutella
Have you seen a Nutella craze?
it's amazing and I love them
you haven't seen nutella craze until you've been to france
well "obsessed" is relative
they eat it like Americans eat all foods
in other words way too much
Oh wow it's s already halfway thru November
Germany is obsessed with Nutella
major error but still valid
honestly i don't know what im really allergic to its all trial and error
exactly
nutella
but hazelnuts are a solid exception
peanuts aren't technically nuts that's why I asked
except hazelnuts for some reason
yes
me?
are you allergic to peanuts?
im sure he does
he knows better than to take me seriously lol
we love you, noah
jk i don't actually mean it
actually wait, that might be giving him too much credit
because he's an idiot
why are you so invested in this
half way there
honestly, if you're gonna miss out on all the nuts but one, it's a good thing hazelnuts are the one you don't miss out on
except hazelnuts
*except hazelnuts
every day is nnn when you're allergic to nuts
thicc penis

HEEHEHEE

100 katya‚Äôs whispering penis simultaneously until it becomes a chant
13 katyas

**penis**
ye took me a sec
ohh

two
and i got italiz

if you say ‚Äúkatya‚Äù three times in the mirror at midnight katya will crawl out of the darkness and whisper *penis* in your ear

I don't think enlarged is the correct word in that case
np
thanks
two asterisks on either side
i don‚Äôt know how to bold
enlarged? that is concerning
i think it might have went over your **head**
<@!278660908212027392>  ‚Äòs ass
wow, noah. it's almost as if that was the joke
Your pathetic ego
you know what else is **enlarged**
butt
I want to make a joke about it but...
I'm laughing
Sigh
in the future, if you need to make your puns stand out, just bold them so the joke word is **enlarged**
üò¶
we've been over this Salina, I can't
nobody else is laughing
Fair enough
Sigh
over you not getting jokes
Fuck off mate
Wait what flack
no I just did now and I'm sad with all the flack I've been giving Salina over that same thing
it was genuine laughter tho
your pity laughing is an insult to my humor
accident mb
Gene don't delete your message it makes me look bad
hahaha
did nobody get my hard pun
eh fair
No I'm invested in the following of rules to the nth degree
thank you it was really hard for me
an impressive feat to be sure
I wish to compliment <@!460689096646590465>  for managing to only put her name down and <@!503787499605458954> for not even accomplishing that
üòÇ
Love thisb
i can't believe he has a routine
he said "once in the morning and once at night is standard" so I think just once a day is an improvement

jiayi: -14
it has already been a week
first week or two will be tough but after that it should be smooth sailing
rip in peace jiayi tho
i just figured that if people were gonna fail, it was probably gonna be in the first week. beyond that, if you can make it a week, you have a pretty good shot of making it all the way
probably tonight as well
i've gotten 3 hours of sleep the past two nights
who has time with all these apps tho
so I wouldn't bet on it Gene
i mean, i would imagine so?
heh harder
it gets harder the longer it goes
barring one or two unexpected people going full jiayi
except jiayi
honestly, it looks like everyone's gonna make it at this point
based on the current records
we can
no
but like
oh my god
and your friends are the players
we technically still could
like fantasy football but for nnn
I feel like we should have placed bets on when each person would fail
these historians really obsessed with hitler's balls, hitler's daddy's balls, or hitler's women's balls

nice
and then there's kenneth, who just hasn't updated in 4 days lol
your welcome
thank you for makinf my day
i laughed
hiayi
Is he trying? ü§î
at least you're trying?
haha
Shit... this is kinda depressing
Goodnight
I'm going to mope and clock out
True
that's all we have to have done tho
It's shit and short but I'll just have to use it lol
I'm done with A and B

I feel like I go on r/all just to make nnn harder
always guess C
(i'm helping yay)
C
A or B?
helen
boi, i haven't started my wt2 yet
I still have an entire section of my religions IA to write aaaaaaaaaaaaa
i don't know, but i'm mildly concerned
What is going on?
<@!193229269076279298> is going to bring up that thing he always told me every other day during our freshman year
motehreukers is the new trending swear
#coexist motehreuckers
we are all humen
and by that i mean there are no sides
oof
no one is on your side
remember
when life gets you down and wearing a frown
jeesoo, have you been sleeping enough lately?
magicians of thoughts are less magical than those magicians we see on tv but theyre often the magicians we se e in those old philisophical textbooks m y friend
just like those magicians you see
from thin air
why oush thoughts when you can pull em
hehe sike
everything is inferior to just pushing thoughts
oh dear
better
If me putting a little more effort and time into translating my words onto this digital screen will make you think of me as a human being worth listening to, then so be it.
although you should still get some rest
jeesoo has a point there
domes not mean i am incapable of forming coherent thought
neither can noah
it makes you seem so not sober
just beasue i cant type
lmao
only life is hard my friend
I can't take you seriously with the grammar and spelling
you sound really tired
oh boy
jeesoo, for your own good, maybe you should go to bed
...
thats the way it should ne
no one cares
thats the whole point
i know you dont cafe
assumptions may be made about trivial matters but it is unwise to resort to them in situatins concerning himan emotions, b
I don't care that much
you expect me to know the difference
r i p
im not talking about the stick
to have experienced this sort of experience
lifan is nice guy
what a surreal experience my friends
very bad men
bad men
tales of men
good to know
thanks
ow
i live a liffe full of lies and deceit; no one is good at heart
jeesoo, maybe just sleep. you'll feel better in the morning
i dont want to meremember
kinda reminds me of something
he cares about correcting himself whenever i mock him for it
I know

costco sells everything in bulk

not the tea chat
thank s saline
fuCC so fgood
pretty sure noah has like 10 toes
costco
ok, tea time
im willing to throw my money at them
yall kno anywhere they sell those man toes in bulk
"men-toss"
so mentos seems to be a reasonable plural
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
100% recommend
don't eat men's toes or mementos please
anyways mentos are delicious
which would set the precedent
men to
mementos
i thought about that after i sent that, noah
give menmentos
man toes
no
men toes
does anyone else feel like it should be "mentoes"?
sned mentos
r i p
theyre so good how the hell did i live without em
back in Germany, I was a different person then
daddy
i lovementos
only way to eat them
vacuum those mentos one at a time into your mouth
wtf?
you bought mentos, but never indulged in cheezits?
back in Germany
I used to buy way to many mentos
Mentos tryna give me mono
i don't think anyone's shit-talking anyone, noah
look i've got a clean record
Nvm
unless you want to participate then you can shit talk anyone
it's sad in the funny way tho
<@!340319804747415553>'s not entirely wrong tbh
mentos > crack cocaine
i mean
yall i bought some mentos for the first time in 4 months and im hooked
sigh okay
<@!340319804747415553> you can shut it
time to stop hurting peoples feelings
its 2018
thank you <@!271149039020408843>
dont go around insulting things like that
hey
the fact that this shit is calculated is sad lollll
no
you mean the equation is sad?
i didn't look at the equation
just the maths
no
eh
not sure though
i think so
i was insulted?
im late to the party
don't insult gene
why?
watching this math is slightly horrifying ngl
yes
wait, so it should be -5 then?
ok
oh
1(1) + 3(-2) = -5
oh, does he already have something down for today?
no gene it's correct
because Jiayi
he should be at -2
how is jiayi already -3
things have been very dry tho
same
i have yet to even look at the sheet
no u
that sounds like a personal problem
I'm not sure that's something **I** want to know
fine, correction:
oh dear
...
yes he would and yes we do
nor something we'd want to know
i don't think that's something he'd willingly tell us
well currently I only have it check up to "xxxxx" which is -10
what the hell
<@!233062637922025472> if you nut more than 5 times in one day come tell me and I will fix the code to work past that
ok code has been fixed in the most ugly way possible
now i wanna play this game
hahaha
10/10
the translations are fucking hilarious
i don't blame you
that's the real reason to get into any chinese game
it's originally in chinese
the reason i got into the game was to see how bad the translations would be
ngl
that's pretty cool tho
i see
if chess had autoplay
eh
so chess?
but the combat is essentially trying to build your formation to fuck with your opponent's team
the game itself is kinda weird
i mod r/royalchaos bc i just happen to be really good at strategizing based on the combat system
watch it be r/satisfyinggrass ayyyyy
which subreddit do you moderate?
end of the road for me
which one?
3) animal photos
2) modding a subreddit
1) checking out new makeup/sales/etc
i use reddit for only a few things
HOW weird?
...
no
hahaha
like the surreal part of youtube?
... how weird?
although Salina does use Reddit so....
you guys haven't been on the weird side of the internet yet
i regret my curiosity too
sigh
i should just not use the internet at all. it has some pretty wack ideas
i got bored, and i found this somewhere on reddit
i just learned about this today
this is why i choose not to learn about this shit
wtf
which for jiayi would be 30
jiayi could just do the entirety of ddd. apparently the purpose of ddd is to do however many days you couldn't get to in nnn
that you break the system
when you fail nnn so bad
idk
then he needs to follow formatting or we need a new equation written
jiayi should still be at -2
fixed
just curious, why does <@!105508293522264064> have -3 despite having no xs?
I'd be more proud if he could get some more sleep
Jiayi I'm proud of you, you have one "o"
two more days and you break even
boi, you're already back at -2
what do you mean "maybe"?
maybe I can get out of this with a positive score...
you're catching up
congrats
oh
I mean yesterday, whoops
and it's 25 hours long
today like just started
what do you mean?
woah
shit I'm safe today
not really
this was totally the reason i stayed up til 12
The day is over. You may now enter your results for November 3rd.
<@!472541429130854421> lowkey watching in the background in judging us all
i feel like i kinda know where this is going tho
what theory?
If Ken was beating him it would finally prove our theory though
b o i
Na Jiayi is beating himself
congrats, you're probably already beating jiayi
ya ill do it
r u doing nnn
<@!105508293522264064>
ken
you're only allowed to edit up until when someone makes a joke about your typos
hey, woah, you can't do that
i took just took look
i was busy so i just took a look
the wat
oh wat
yeah, i know
but again, acronyms are hard
I have it but I'd never expect someone to get the acronym or ever really understand what it means
F
i'm sorry
oof
Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis
japanesr rake ass
jame's rice alley?
jerry's rafting adventure?
JRA any guesses
i know what it is, but i just don't usually see it as an acronym
this is sexism
l
sorry
Ah, I normally don't get acronyms and I'm definitely not getting that one
acronyms are hard
oh
wait how do you guys not know what pms is
scream as in i dont want that happening
pre menstrual syndrome
That sounds like horny or STD's
p m s
scream
i will screem
pmsing?
if anything touvhrs my vagina
im pmsing
im like anti horny
Then fill it tomorrow
i know im not gonna nut
yeah
katya probably doesnt wanna stay up until 12 am every night to fill in
<@460689096646590465> and <@503787499605458954> you guys aren't filling out the spread sheet, <@278660908212027392> the day isn't over yet, <@105508293522264064> I'm disappointed you aren't, participating you're weak
USHAHAHA
that's fucking terrifying
i just looked up what fibonacci numbers were after you said that
and fivonacci fap february
jiayi gotta wait for devemebrr
there's some nuance to the definition, but that's basically it
someone who doesn't experience sexual attraction
i'm curious
according to your search, what is the definition of asexual?
that's not really something worth clearing search history?
jk
nice now go clear your search history
most do
just looked it up to check
true
but usually not as much
it's actually pretty common if i recall correctly
to be fair, asexuals can have libidos and need to do the thing
this is the month for asexuals
sorry dude you chose to participate in this
december's gonna be hilarious cuz jiayi's gonna actually make it through the whole thing
^^^
wrong month
how many 'x's I can get in one day
maybe I should have an alternative challenge
no.
can i just put in "oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo" for one day and just win? lmao
you really dont
gene I think i have my priorities straight here
unless you have a very low refractory period
^^
jiayi, use that time to fucking sleep lol
...
he said "once in the morning and once at night is standard"
shit
wow, helen, you have very low faith in jiayi
so if you nut twice in a day it would be xx
also you have to enter an x for every nut
lol
ew
innuendo not intended
keep it up dude
lol you're going to be a meme
wrong month, jiayi
I'm winning
why tf is this so thought-out?
there's a points system?
lmao
does that count?
I can manage -30 points
well whoops I already failed haha
for some reason, i keep forgetting november is 30 days instead of 31
otherwise you fail
your goal is to last all thirty days of november
wdym
is this like a as many days as possible thing
put ur name in and ur procress and ill do the formula
here is the spreadcheet
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tt0X7hH9tRJoTXwor3jaIO_3UQKbcw47B9JQIWL5U74/edit?usp=sharing
ok im making soreadsheet today
lmao
https://twitter.com/BurgerKing/status/1057998312790466561?s=20
burger king did a what now?
so there's that
burger king did tweet about it tho
nay
are we all supposed to go around a give a yea or nay, or only say something if it's yea?
did anyone nut
ill make spreadsheet soon
F
but it still does
no porn should show up
na my problem is the bad filtering on r/popular on reddit
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en
Use this chrome extension to block porn sites on your own browser so you can resist
i really am invested in this romance
yeah
I also love the concept of people just watching porn for the sake of watching porn , like the story is really engaging
we're playing with strikes though aren't we
F
F
this is prime time for decisions i'm probably gonna regret later
ya know what, it's 3:30 AM
i guess i could join if it's just this group and the majority of us. i mean, since it's just about stuff we *don't* do, checking the spreadsheet probably won't be that life-scarring
oh, wow, noah actually wasn't kidding when he said i was the odd one out
F
f
F
in case we haven‚Äôt established this yet
uh
sharing is caring
do you not care about us gene?
or is that the point?
i feel like this is just gonna devolve into us sh
