My last day here is Saturday if anyone wants to hang out before then
"The cutoff depends on a variety of factors, but it‚Äôs primarily determined by the number of applications and the strength of the overall pool. The point is also different for Washington residents, out-of-state applicants and international students. Majors are also taken into account for applicants in computer science and engineering, where seats are limited."

i love it
zoom chat is honestly great
**is it a**
:regional_indicator_a: insult to me
:regional_indicator_b: compliment for my mom
!poll "is it a" "insult to me" "compliment for my mom"
My mom: Can you guess who he is? (Pointing to me)

<@173668455856340994>
Got called into work while still in bed
Looooool
Digital everything typically
Some def do posters but I feel like it's much less common
Idk standard stuff fb/insta/email/website if they've got one
I forgot about this completely
FSAE uses discord, works well enough
I also have to do email stuff but that‚Äôs basically it
PSP is trying to transition to discord with moderate success
8 members
Prolly only because we have like
Works pretty well
Cube club uses messenger
Yeah that helps, thanks!
<@472541429130854421> does that help?
Long story short: There's a lot of clubs and standing out is hard
Most attendees for events come from our email list and friends, compared to only 10% from posters and other physical adverts
I'd say the biggest problem at have is getting the word out to as many people as possible, our flyers event posts are commonly drowned out by other clubs doing the same thing so it's easy to ignore us for some of the larger ones
I also have a hand in the poster design, those posters find themselves all around campus, including dorms
Our events are primarily advertised on Facebook, email lists, and officer Instagram stories
SASE uses messenger for officer chat and one note for meeting notes and shared information
bold of you to assume i join or investigate clubs
lemme put on my Secretary hat real fast
amazing how nobody said anything
Open question for everyone: What kind of social media/communication methods do your university's clubs use? Are there any ways you wish access to club information were easier or more efficient? I'm possibly building a project with a couple friends related to this topic so I'd love some opinions!
We all know what really happened to that apple though...
No taste
Only look
He the Apple of Eden
Aw is he the apple of your eye?
apple has been sliced
*slits your throat*
Gimme a sliced apple
Hey Alan
Congrats
A random ass sliced apple
You WILL get random calls for like
Have fun lol
oooo
oooo
let's go

Tbh I'll literally forget who people are in my sub list from not watching them for a long time looil
I'm amazed that you have 40 gaming subscriptions
I'm stupid lmfao
Oh wait
Oh did yours have a specific order?
I appreciate the complete lack of order for the list
For some reason the internet in my house just died RIP
This did not add up to the right amount but I'm way too lazy to go check what I missed

The other 10% are music channels and the very few gaming channels I'm subbed to
Those 1001 subs a good 90% of them are other editors
For me it's mostly AMV content because I watch a shit ton of them
üëç
also i just unsubbed from 20 channels
so it was just all great
and the outro song led me to find a very good album from a very new band
but it was great
yeah he was behind schedule
and i was very happy to consume his 47 minute video that he released in 2020 about the top 10 games of 2017
shammy uploaded this week for the first time in literally a year
GSL doesn't start for 70 mins, so I got time
actually I should categorize them
most of the channels I'm subscribed to produce content at a very slow rate
what do you guys mostly watch on youtube anyways
the seven whose names are shown plus 994
Perfect
you have 1001 actually
you do have over 1000
wow
Damn I need to sub 6 more channels
üëç
you just motivated me to go through and unsub to people I dont watch anymore actually
not that much
i have no idea
ayeeee adam neely
<@233062637922025472> can you come in and flex on them?
how much of your subscription content do you acutally wach
either way the question stands
lol
oh wait
do you even watch half the content?
i dont understand having so many subs
maybe there is and I'm just dumb
I wish there was a way to categorize
I thought I had too many
surprised you have so many more subs
I'm actually
I dont think the kinds of people to start youtube drama are exactly down your alley
somehow I have *a few* subscriptions
but I seem to avoid the vast majority of drama somehow
I have no clue what any of this is
It also confuses me how invested the whole internet gets in makeup community drama lmfao idk what's going on anymore
It confuses me how people have been totally chill w him for so long
jeffree star is just a hot mess of a racist and quite rich/influential asshole
karmageddon is the big youtube drama that is ongoing
*yes*
im big dum
what is that name
This gives me jefree star karmageddon vibes
check the date
So since they're being shipped out it fits cause they're not physically being thrown?
Maybe he means literally?
In getting very mixed signals right now
trump you dumbass
._.
im so confused
what
How is there always a tweet lmfaooooo
Bruh
Nap time class
It's time
0 credit optional attendance in-person class
ü§û
it's just gonna discourage talent from coming to the US even more
is a huge mistake
the suspension of h1b visas too
ig we hope trump gets voted out and policy gets reversed assuming covid gets somewhat under control
idk
then we hope to actually bump this bitch, right?
but assuming we actually learn from the Second Coming of COVID in the US
sure, another year/couple quarters/semesters may be online
what about after covid?
cause like
wow thats fucking shitty as hell
Wow this sucks
hell no
ma2 are you taking summer classes as well?
yes
*yes*
I'm dumb then
Wait really
I'm taking summer classes too?
?
this happened on r/ubc, someone was complaining about proctorio support being ass and THE LITERAL CEO showed up and borderline doxxed him
I realize I'm the only person still taking summer classes but LMAO
i'm prob too much of a biohazard
honestly id be down to do stuff on my off days but like
if not then you guys have fun
and we have to wear masks and stay six feet apart at all times
sure, i'll have to wait until you've quarantined for two weeks though
Lol
Since it won't learn fucking
I'm also very happy that Swype learned "fuxking"
I'd settle for a fuxking puddle
It's been ages since I've swam too I miss it
Oh shit ok no we gotta do a lake hike then
Put me on a leash
Restrain me
If there's a body of water at mailbox
It's been *months* since I swam
üëç
Taking half the load though unless I change my mind
Ruff
I start class again next week
Also Cashflow lol
Ah
Something to do
I miss having work
I'm already bored as shit
Not alone
Same tbh
I just wanna go outside
Nice
It'll probably kill me but sure
Anyone wanna come do mailbox w me? Lol
But yeah
üò†
I'm quarantining myself for at least a week
We gotta *hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiike*
Who's actually free and able to hang out sometime
Figuratively and literally
Haha I didn‚Äôt register for housing, there‚Äôs no going back now
i have labs and engl class on campus
im going back
idk just a thought, a lot of my friends are planning to get apartments in various places across campus and the city lol so we've all offered like hey if anyone ever wants to sleep over you're welcome
hmm
oh that did not even cross my mind
thursday nights
find someone to stay over with
yeah I was about to suggest
maybe i can chill with Alan and Fran sometimes though
and i *really* dont wanna have to wake up at like 6 on fridays
the room tbd class is online
so i have the fun conundrum of live there or commute
they keep going back and forth on which classes will be in person though so it's a little messy rn lmfao
same w me
they get the option of online or hybrid
he's staying here
<@!233062637922025472> ?
I actually don't really know
which is helen, and noah (?)
a better question is probably who's not going back
kickin at our apartment
me
fran and I will at least be in the area
who's actually going back?
so for fall quarter/1st semester
^ that.

Alex and I got on the Dean's list for winter quarter <a:mercenarydance:642488020267958273>
alright so his total user base is around 100 people
like 17?
I'm adding starbot's "user base" as a resume point
<@!340319804747415553> how many people are in your fraternity server btw
Cause native Hawaiians would probably fall under the native american/indigenous people category
See that's why im wondering
I vote native Hawaiians
in asia specifically let's say
who else should qualify then
Considering that it's a particular country
Nah I'm just saying it's funky to me that it's just Cambodians who would be an underrepresented minority
Vietnam is the best off
I think Laos also had their share of bombings
Not like southeast Asian or whatnot
Yeah but it's only cambodians?
yeah okay I think I get it
and the mass killings
and the civil war
probably the genocide now that I think about it
maybe it was the genocide
good question
Aint Cambodian just fall under the umbrella of Asian?
How is Cambodian an underrepresented minority?
Okay question
747 counting hyphen-words as one word
thanks guys we got it under 750
removing 50% of phrases and combining sentences together 14 times can lead to some weird patterns and fluctuations
thank you though the punctuation and wording stuff really helps
I see what you're getting at but yeah kinda low order concern
lol some of the engineering statements I've read almost sounded like resumes
but i don't know if that's a huge concern for you
one final thing i want to pick out is that it does read a little repetitively
alright that's fair
In the end I decided the catalyst for entering into CS was unique and important enough that it justified taking up a large portion of the introduction
but to be honest i think you might have weighted your mother's background a little to heavily--but that's just my opinion
yes i see that
I weighed the ideas of each one and decided how much I wanted them to stand out
if you look back at early drafts some of them are 1000s of words over limit
nono I didn't mean it that way
i feel like that's worded to sound passive aggressive but i don't mean that with any animosity
alright, if you don't want to change it it's your personal statement
plus diversity points since I qualify as a "underrepresented minority" at UW because I have Cambodian background
plus it adds to the themes of underserved communities and overcoming hardships
I'd rather it be more descriptive though, since it adds a lot of personalization and uniqueness to the overall drive
you use it to justify strongly identifying with a personal purpose, but that can be established more succinctly
I would disagree, if my mother's story is what inspired me to get into computing in the first place, then the story and its effects on me should rightly take 1/3 of the essay since it addresses 1/3 of the prompt
and the truth of the matter is that your mother's story is a poignant and important one, but the tie to your personal statement isn't strong enough to warrant it being 1/3 of the essay
they want to see more about how it ties to you as an individual
it's something the PH admissions ppl brought up for me bc i had a question about my family background/community life on my app
but i think it's taking up too much space in your statement
i understand that
this statement is to give a voice as to why I did all those things, and I'm using my mom's story as my anecdote to explain the things I did
don't make assumptions about what the admissions person will think
okay i said this to jarrett on his design app and imma say this to you
reason I did is because my other documents like my transcript and resume speak entirely about myself
no it's valid
but it is something that admissions ppl do pick up on
and i feel like such an asshole for bringing it up
you spent 1/3 of your personal statement on a story that centers on your mom, not you
sure
can i be frank w you about your personal statement
hey alan?
the final papers I sent in were the first drafts with one or two changed sentences
all the papers I sent in for english were first drafts
But half the time I just sent in an outline and it was fine
Like you had to submit something
Poli at ubc was honestly super lax with drafts
it's dumb but you gotta work w the process
Booo
they like to have you save your initial draft and then have your final draft to show "significant changes"
that was me like a year ago until i had to do engl papers at uw
I only ever make an official draft if I need to submit it
that's just my process
then i'll do 2-3 editing passes max
i'll generally do one rough draft
I think drafts in general are a bit of a waste of time lmfao I tend to keep one doc and just edit it constantly, but tbf Alan's thing is a lot more organized and actually keeps a record of progress
I was up to 30+ drafts for my UW essay back then
I cannot relate at all
We've had this discussion
It's just how he works
but whatever floats your boat man
excessive number of drafts
that's honestly a kind of like
Jesus
last draft I sent is about 4 or 5 versions out of date lol
Partially bc I think the original is a bit dramatic
> "I need to gain a better understanding of computing and its place in the world in order to prevent my creations from harming their intended audience"
I also like Salina's edit here
Draft 14
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F3VuVAg_3qqrmq-qnrctkrbmwmFsMemG2lVrX_zBBdQ/edit?usp=sharing
But yes I agree
aight that's fair
i think it's feasible to cut it down to the word limit but it probably comes at the cost of your voice
I think he finished another draft last night
im looking at the draft you sent a while back and there's somewhat sizable amt of wording that could be modded for concision
^ i agree with that
Another wording thing I'd consider changing is just moving "examples of tools" to just starting the sentence with "for example,"
the passive isn't as explicit but it still is
technically yeah
> "designed for the benefit of the people, but are potentially subject to harm-promoting abuse"
I like this better than the original but technically it's still passive
I would edit the first bit just by shifting to present tense, bc these are still ongoing things:
Facial recog, social media, and AdSense are all examples of tools designed for the benefit of the people, but can be abused to promote harm.

But if you're set on eliminating passive (which I don't think is always evil, fwiw): 
Facial recog, social media, and AdSense are all examples of tools designed for the benefit of the people, but grant potentially abusive powers to those who would promote harm
"I need to gain a better understanding of computing and its place in the world in order to prevent my creations from harming their intended audience"
not my fave wording but the point here is your personal statement, not my writing prefs
"designed for the benefit of the people, but are potentially subject to harm-promoting abuse"
i mean you could say something like
lmao
First of all you're missing an Oxford comma
"so that the things I create can only heal people and not hurt them" it's not great but that's what springs to mind
Maybe I'll come up with something
For the other one, I have no idea what you could do while keeping the sentence the same.
I don't know what you could do to change that unless you changed the entire sentence.
maybe
"benefit people but are abused in ways"
green highlights are passive voice
anyone have any ideas on how to unpassive-ise this section
it felt like I woke up from a month-long nap or something
like when I came back from Japan everything was eerily the same as I remembered
it does feel surreal after not being back for a while
Though I suppose normalcy has gone out the window in the meantime
It feels surreal to be back and I haven't even been gone that long so idk why my brain is making it a big deal
Tell me how that goes
Uh huh
Also same I‚Äôm buying SP 500 and Facebook today
Hahaha that is so true
Because no one fucking specified which way we were trying to flatten the curve
We flattened the curve vertically
Time to buy the dip again
Welp
Quite
This is just sad
watching my roommate suffer through the calculus series brought back memories
let me just rub in the fact that I did all my math before I even graduated
But if I start ranting here on math I won't stop until the sun rises so I won't go much further into that
(my math grades are above average but still make up my weakest grades)
Like, if the reason I didn't get into CSE was because I wasn't as good at integral calculus as math, physics, Mech, CivE, AA, or EE students, that in of itself is a telling story
at least for that program
the caps from what i heard are pretty strict
i think they're 100 now
nursing was capped at 60 till last year
I can't say until this Placement round is over, but I really hope that the number of clearly capable students doesn't outnumber the seats in cse
It's a matter of available seats vs interested students, and for some reason interested students always wins the number game
and less common
but I feel like it's less strict?
IR takes about 150 people per year I believe
hell, I'm in one
our CS is similar i think, except direct admit isn't a thing (?)
idk it's not like we don't also have capacity-constrained highly competitive majors
ok that kinda sucks
Their page says uw admits 1000 cse-seeking students a year
sorry for the endless questions tn I'm just curious
CSE has around 500 seats supposedly
wow
design was hard capped at 60 people
Depends on what major, but CSE and Informatics (another computing major) both have a set number of seats
you try to convince people that their second and third choices of major are "just as good"
is it like a specific number for each major?
how strict are the capacity constraints?
so what do you do
you don't want to end up with a bunch of people aimlessly left floating after getting rejected from their intended major and not want to do anything else, but you also don't want a bunch of people stuck in a major they realize they don't actually like
one group knows exactly what they want to do and won't accept anything else and the other doesn't know what they want to do and need to experience it before they can deicide if it's what they really want to do
The number one thing I hate about UW is how cutthroat some things are, and the capacity constrained problem is at the center of it
I think the problem is they're trying to cater to two very different groups
public health RARELY takes first years
other depts are assholes about what year you are
There's not a lot of clean cut solutions either besides getting more funding or cutting admission even lower
Or you miss out on applying to other majors because you can only apply freshman direct to one major
Like imagine getting into CS direct after taking one year of AP CS and finding out you actually hate CS after the first year
Which I think creates as many problems as it solves
Some departments are putting more emphasis on freshman direct admit to alleviate some of the pressure
rip
I thought the arts programs were also fairly open but I heard someone got denied
Nobody's sweating to get into ChemE for one
(at UW)
All the ones worth doing lol
also, are all majors at UW competitive?
hm
They call it late discovery admission, and I imagine they only do it for extreme circumstances
Basically, it's as difficult as it would be if you were applying as a non major
CS to CompE would maybe make you take a 5th year for all the extra physics and math and engineering extras
The easiest transfer is CompE to CS since they're 90% the same but even the Allen School is clamping down on that one
yeah I get that you'd have to take more classes to catch up and maybe extra time
cause basically only the math and gen requirements would transfer over
trying to switch would be really hard once I'm in the middle of it
I take like 2 ee classes and 17 mech classes
^
The requirements are different enough that you'd likely need to take a 5th year to catch up
EE is capacity constrained for one, so transferring late is probably a no no
Like, to go from Mech to Electrical, there's a lot of issues
O_O
Transferring probably depends on the majors, but I imagine it's a process that requires at least one meeting with each of the advisory boards of each major
question was less about the content and more about the school policy tbh
so I would assume it depend on what you were trying to switch to and how far along you were
after a certain point they diverge quite a bit
to answer cin's question a little better the engineering majors plus compsci apps are due on the 1st
idk, I would assume no?
> can you transfer between them later on?
also no one answered this is this hard to do at UW?
my new strategy for whenever I need to get up early is to just stay up all night
^^^
have you considered waiting until 8 to go to sleep
peas
<:thonk:702395981903429732> i think she's onto something
go to sleep later
t a t a
hopefully no wake up before 8
me schleep
i have no clue what i wanna do with myself so why not go with the one that lets me decide things even later
which is why I'm planning to do a masters
so thats what i have as my main choice right now
it is
meche seems the most versatile
<@!110137446053736448> go with the cool degree
see <@!503787499605458954> gets it
no, of course not
no
cause chicks dig degrees
do you think <@!340319804747415553> would be dating me if I wasn't going to collage
basically I had an architecture phase and then was like but they're always unemployed then was like making cities would be cool too then I realized a) most of it IS boring shit like highways and bridges in the middle of nowhere and b) I love poli and might still end up unemployed lol
*to be cool*
and what are we getting degrees for...
I just saying it's not *cool*
so I'm not saying civ is bad
serving the general populus instead of the top 1%
nutty
civ gets to make stuff like this
and aa gets to make stuff like this
buildings are cool too
look mech and ee get to make stuff like this
maybe that's why I didn't end up doing civ
but then
Just do systems, it's like engineering engineers
I'm clearly not boring
jokes on them the end goal is to get an engineering degree just so i can be a janitor in a fancier place
Chin did CivE when she was in UW
we just can't agree on anything tonight can we
loooool
where I wanted to do civ engineering
a phase
bro I had
idk anyone doing civ (cause civ people are boring, jk... kinda)
can you transfer between them later on?
The hardest part will be deciding which one when they all inevitably hand him an offer lol
well I'm mech and Nicholas is ee if you ever want to talk
no
Fran does have the numbers to get him into all of those
hah ahah aha aha ah a a h a ha a aa hha  a a  h     a hh      a       h     a
you haven't really decided on one yet?
oh very cool
i mean its just requesting so it cant really hurt to do em all
meche, cive, ee, mayyyyybe aa
or rather request
ill apply
im just not sure what i really really wanna do
always have really
i know what im gonnna apply to
fran do you know what you wanna apply to now? just curious
mid autumn quarter for me i think
i still gotta finish prereqs
i cant do mine yet
and mine before Alan's
Salina's was before mine
it varies from major to major
and if yes when is that
<@&574247915518689281> is everyone's major app due at the same time
thanks~
I'll start implementing revisions on Sunday, so by then if you can
it's due July 1st if you were wondering
@everyone
if you could read this over and give some revisions or thoughts I'd be super grateful

hey guys if you didn't already know I've been grinding my CompE application for like the past 3 weeks
Leaving my apartment was a terrible idea today I'm literally dead on my feet
no?
yes
shut up not funny didn't laugh get off the stage boo loser
wait your in a van?
take before and after pics
lol
also also also I like havent slept so that would be smart too
I gotta start packing though
but I've seen people going so üëÄ
technically it's "closed"
kinda really wanna go hike quarry rock, also
I love it when my impulsive desires are justified
I also made a list of restaurants to hit up with the excuse that if I get more groceries now they'll prob go to waste
grouse mountain is reopen as of like, 2 weeks ago? just been too busy to pay a trip

HOO RAH HOO RAH
YOU GOT THIS
GO CINDY
lolll
ok I feel like I should elaborate bc it's not just that I'm a mess it's that apparently it takes an hour for our TA to check everyone's IDs
maybe I should've actually slept LMAO
idk what to do with this extra time
apparently my exam starts about an hour later than I thought

not everything
are you one of those people that watch everything at x2 speed?
-_-
discovered chrome extensions that speed up html videos for you... absolute life-changer this would've saved me so much time if I figured it out 2 months ago
üá´
ah yeah that might be worth giving a shot
might request a grade rebalance
ripperoon
oh my god
i hate myself!
AND I DIDN'T REALIZE
WAS OPEN BOOK
THAT I GOT LIKE A 60 ON AND WAS DEPRESSED ABOUT FOR 2 WEEKS
THE MACRO MIDTERM
so fucking stupid it hurts

Hm
and leave the rest the same
ignore the sigma
just
they shouldnt be sigma notations
wait
So the logic tracks
I am a pretentiously moral asshole
although, salina, that is a fairly pretentious sounding sound you got there, which follows the law that if n>m, pretentiousness is suggested
>=1*
i guess i didnt adress that the others are n,m>1 only
MM -> only applies to n >= 2
Mh
you're breaking the laws of language there friend
m
either disgust or laughter depending on the context though
i think thats too niche to demand a guide
uhhh
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
but one more
okay
<@!478706068223164416> you thought i was joking about this didnt you
Inbox? How does that work?
because it's actually super useful
when did Discord get an Inbox feature
Salina working on the set of Grey's Anatomy over there
i'm starting to think that the medical field is lowkey reality tv
Omg this is amazing
this one slide sums it up perfectly
this was all thanks for a random ass Stanford lecture I found by google https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/slides/cs224n-2019-lecture06-rnnlm.pdf
there's one problem though, it's gonna be SUPER SLOW
then THAT would be proper RNN
and chose the most predicted word
then took THOSE results
he would predict the next word for every length of that sentence from 0 to n
so if Starbot is trying to predict the next word in a sentence of n length
but the idea is to take the many *results* of the n-gram predictions
it'll take some effort
there's one small change I can do
but
his modeling was closer to an n-gram language model which is slightly short of a proper neural network
it turns out Starbot didn't have recurrent neural networking

I mean I can‚Äôt bc im still working during the school year but y‚Äôall knock yourselves out
My flatmates would probably protest about me moving to Hawaii, but yall are free to crash at Wen Roosevelt Cafe whenever you're in the area
yo I would be hella down
That‚Äôs same as here to duke so I am ambivalent
3 hours apart
Wouldn't the timezones fuck us up
Think about it
Zoom classes on the beach
What if this fall, everyone taking online classes rents an apartment in Hawaii and stays there for two months
I have an idea
Oh, well, at least there's that
except if you don't show up to court for your case you automatically lose
I mean technically yes
did I get that right?
So basically, you just pay not to go to court and you're good?
Then you lose your bail money
And you dont show up to court
So if you pay to get out for a while
You get bail back
Does anyone know what the point of bail is? I think it‚Äôs dumb and stacked against people who don‚Äôt have money, but does anyone know what it‚Äôs positives are?
nice
ayy they curved my physics final up to 81 from 78
OK
I'M DRIVING TO YOU RIGHT NOW

hmmmmmmok
We can go to Bell Square first to see if he responds by then
i texted him too
Ok but I gotta be back in the evening to cook for my dad

¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
or advertisemtn
do we trust google
I checked bell Square and ikea's sites
well I guess no pot then
pottery barn bell square says clsoed on google
I think so, the websites say they're open with precautions
are they even open lol
now cuz I'm bored lol
now? today? or you mean online
visit ikea, bell Square, pottery barn etc to see what kinda stuff we'd need for the apartment
hm?
<@110137446053736448> wanna go idea shopping
mmm
new manga is out on the 16th

Honest to god wtf is Arizona smoking

Major app
personal statement?
we'll see about that tomorrow
I think I have enough material here to create one coherent version now
I just finished the 5th draft of my personal statement
math is canceled
ü§°
well thats a 3.3 in math for me i guess
woops
haha i got 23/30 on midterm 5 so she just excused it lol
kinda similar to Skyline
A range is 90-100, B range is 80-90 etc
10 point system?
pretty much all of duke uses the standard 10 point system
my gpa and grades are pretty fairly mapped
But to imagine that the majority of students are getting shafted even harder than you or me is ludicrous
I'm at the 75th percentile and getting a rodeo
Yeah math is messed up if you're not getting consistent grades even at the very top of the curve
That's your average of midterms averaged with your final
We're gonna say for practical purposes that you had about a 90 in 124
and i wait in fear/anticipation for my physics grade
im really hoping midterm 5 for math can boost my grade a decent amount
and my prof is infamous for murdering gpas since she doesn't curve
even chem isn't that steep
chegg
online classes
what is happening in 126
geez
idk man
apparently
91% 3.3 in 126
that seems about right
95% 3.9 in 125
I had to load up catalyst to get my 124 percent
but i got a 3.8 with 100% MT1, 92% MT2, 82% Final
for some reason that wasnt a thing for the great JAROD ALPER
cause i didnt have the class through canvas
i cant tell you what percent i got in 124
basically a year
6 days ago
bruh didn't you take that like a year ago
but lemme see what i can find for current
cause midterm 5 isnt graded yet
lol I still have never had a curved class in college
i cant 100% report that yet
it looks like the curve moves up 6% each time
how does your percent grade in math compare to your GPA grade over the 3 courses
math grades
my what nows
<@!110137446053736448> do your percent-to-GPA trends match this pattern or were you too good to care
I'm lucky that the rest of my grades are very high otherwise
rip grades
yikes
not that anyone asked but yes I will be putting this in my personal statement
there's an incredibly clear improvement here in my percent grades but the GPAs don't reflect that at all
math 124: 78.6% (3.4)
math 125: 84.2% (3.2)
math 126: 91.7% (3.4)
here are my math grades, and their associated percentage, in order
you know what the most fucked up part about math at uw is
Lmao
Oh mannnn
bruh

but dating someone class of 21 at this point is a little iffy
if i drop into class of 24 and date someone in class of 22 that's totally within range
i'm one phantom year ahead
i would possibly date a junior but i wouldn't call them cute
it's ~1 a year ahead
but 19 and a junior isn't exactly normal
I have junior standing currently but I'm also old for my grade
... wow
sorry my degen is leaking
*hot mommy gf*
i think she'd only be a year older than me/noah
like if cindy was two years ahead of us
2 years ahead can really be as little as like 8 months older
How are they different
cause those are very different
I feel like you need to specify 2 years older or 2 years ahead
Would you not date someone 2 years up? <@472541429130854421>
i am so confused
....
SENPAIIIIII
you sound like you have some experience
Absolutely does not feel weird
feels kinda weird calling an upperclassman cute lmao
sure
she cute?
it's a girl lol
he cute?
The junior who was my Computer Architecture TA last semester also played Secret Hitler with me and my friends, became my substitute RA after mine left, and is now also interning at Microsoft and we're gonna connect next week üò±

fuckin

okay he's done lol
i was like huh what's he doing stalking his cousin(?)
oh fun
my cousin is graduating lol
what?
If anyone wants to come look for Damond Lai with me come thru

nearly maxed ram usage in the name of ACaDemIc InTegGrity
combine that with whatever else academic integrity bs software they're trying to dick your computer with and there you have it
or save it to your disk at a painfully slow rate
adding a webcam means that your ram also has to hold all that data while it uploads it to the server
because chrome is a greedy little cunt
I'm guessing you have chrome open which will account for a lot of that usage
ram usage?
I smell a cs question
also genuinely why does it take so much RAM????????
there is nothing more uncomfortable than watching my own face through the webcam while struggling w the shit canvas calculator and consciously trying very hard not to look away from the screen
(You take your test)
Big brother is watching
that's all
FUCK proctorio

almost?

almost feel bad for playing modern warfare during her classes
she's a very nice teacher
lmaoooooO
"I know you told me that this isnt a primary class for you, and i appreciate the honesty"
to be fair though she started that with
.... damn
"I know you're not putting in very much effort"
despite the fact that in my final one-on-one she told me:
we now have an A in sketching class
yeet
yei

starbot is officially going on my resume
just finished legally blonde, i love it
Galaxy Quest is funky.
Legally blonde is amazing
oh god no
well this is quite a striking contrast in genre from what i chose to watch, Legally Blonde
you liked the cat
those are bad testimonies
fuck you
I recommend 
1. Alien ( <@!340319804747415553> liked this one)

6. The Thing 
7. The Terminator
8. Terminator 2: Judgment Day

oof haha
apparently audience reception was like 70-80% positive but im more in line with the 30% of critics statistic lol
i have never heard of bloodshot so i don't think i would have watched it anyway lmao
oh and cool vfx
everything else about the movie sucked ass
some cool action
and i recommend staying away from the movie bloodshot with vin diesel
or if someone wants to virtually watch one together i'm down
1984 predator movie
any kind of movie
anyone got movie recommendations?
Idk
Lol
cause i gotta say it works
is it for dramatic effect with all the shit that's going down these days
can anyone tell me wtf is up with the weather?
the webassigns actually prepped me really well for this one
danke
best of luck
didn't take it as I said
i hope
eh, they'll regrade with midterm 5
bruh
im so confused
but the grades slot stil lsays 3.3
so im 3.4 as well
went from 90.6 to 91.22
to now
my percentage from eary this morning
I knew I was too average to get a 3.8
hold up
hold up
3.4 lol
still 3.8?
what'd you get <@!478706068223164416>
so hopefully i can bump it up
i think it went super smooth
but i just took midterm 5
so i have 3.3
thats reflected correctly on my canvas now
ok
whachu mean
Bruh she messed up
I do not believe yours to be 3.1 though, that's way too low
I think it's this entry
So 3.7?
I get 3.66
Bees
<@110137446053736448> MATH GRADES ARE OUT IT'S TIME TO STRESS OUT

Wholesome
my chem prof is usually kind of a stone cold bitch but this was legitimately sweet of her to send out
we were granted a 24 hour extension but it fell through
why did so many people not do it?
what happened?
dafuck?
LET'S GO
buuuut'
if we were still at UW the ode computers have the full adobe suite unlocked
ü§°
i get that now, alan
so for spring quarter
FRAN I PIRATED IT
was for quarantine
at least the offer alan showed a while ago
i'm pretty sure the subscriptions should be active as long as you have your college email?
i wasnt aware you already had it <:thonk:702395981903429732>
before I came to uw
did you think I paid for my copy
i hope you're staying in college for more than two days
*remember how you only have that through may 31st*
i want one that i'd have free access to for more than 2 days
just get premiere like all the cool kids do
i would like to take advantage of mine but i have no projects that require anything adobe lol
Yeah for that convenience is best
so i can hopefully avoid the copyright hammer
yeah don't you guys get the whole adobe suite for college?
i can at least use it really easily to reduce clips and add song titles
which is somehow worse
now we have windows video editor
but i liked it
it was horrible
yeah i loved WMM
adobe premiere ü§°
press x to doubt
WMM is pretty dogshit but wondershare filmora is passable for basic stuff and easy to use
When I first started off I used windows movie maker and wondershare filmora
That's a good one
spam folder exists lol
eh whatever
Free but it does take an email if you care about that
I know you didn‚Äôt ask me, but DaVinci Resolve is solid
hey <@!233062637922025472> do you know of any free video editing software that isnt complete dogshit? at least passable?
its something we're considering
oh so you're just gonna sign for a few extra months in the summer?
We're down to a few options and planning to apply to a few this weekend, but we found out that a lot of places outside STUDENT student housing don't prelease for fall until midsummer
haven't signed anything yet
<@!478706068223164416> what place did you guys end up getting?
but for some reason excluding literally only adobe fonts
id like the thank UW for giving me the entire adobe suite
hmu ok
hey if you or someone you know needs a place to stay in north seattle for three months from early june to early september
i have a 48 minute training that basically accomplishes little to nothing w/ no rewind/forward function and it's just the wispiest mumbling voice talking so slowly
ack.
i am slowly losing my mind
finishing a 5-page paper with 2 lines on the fifth page cause i dont wanna get filler-y and repetitive üëå
As bad as it sounds idk if I'm personally interested in that enough to crank out 4000 words
ooooh
You could take a focus on Asian American discrimination, I bet that'd make a good paper
then id leave the discussion
that would be my contribution
**nothing has changed**
people are sitll too dumb to listen to the cdc tell them to stay home
people are still to dumb to realize masks help others stay healthy
animal corssing and the switch have seen a surge in popularity
But I've learned I hate sociology anyways so it's not like I'm gonna be taking it lol
I kinda think it's way too early to comprehensively evaluate the impacts rn
My soci prof replaced our final w 7 discussions and mini tests on the impacts of covid bc we live in a society man
Would not be surprised
<@503787499605458954> is this for real
didnt even use it
so i jsut noped out
and it was some garbled mess
i asked wolfram just for the antderivative
so WHAT THE FUCK
I asked symbolab and they couldn't solve that either
except actually solve the first integral
i was able to do everything
as long as I don't get a citation
it's fine
midterm went to shit
it's the universe balancing out
ye
remember when I said 5 squared was 125
but still
it doesnt affect the final answer
i also said that 5 cubed was 25 and not 125
CANCELED
is
math
me @ stats but i don't know how to solve that undecipherable vocab nightmare fuel
oof
today's midterm be like
math is canceled
<@!110137446053736448> <@!110137446053736448> <@!110137446053736448> <@!110137446053736448> <@!110137446053736448> <@!110137446053736448> <@!110137446053736448> <@!110137446053736448> <@!110137446053736448> <@!110137446053736448> <@!110137446053736448> <@!110137446053736448> <@!110137446053736448> <@!110137446053736448> <@!110137446053736448> <@!110137446053736448> <@!110137446053736448> <@!110137446053736448> <@!110137446053736448> <@!110137446053736448> <@!110137446053736448> <@!110137446053736448>
the loss of your approval is not a tragedy
oh well
if there was a repetition in there it wouldve been killer
i read it too quickly
hm?
sorry 10th grade Salina I take that back
wait
bruh
bruh that`s a raw ass line
basically
Cut me some slack with that closing bc this was like 10th grade
Female empowerment is great but especially in the tech field it‚Äôs not done very well
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t3qaXUt7tKipppW4YVbc6DdDPlbfc_gFbh1_tDlFjGs/edit
Which we had to do once a week
Gimme a sec to pull up a journal entry I wrote for a day in the program
Tbh as someone who‚Äôs done girls who code
I'd say about 1/4 of this is coding and the rest reads like an arts and crafts workshop
book commits the sin of referring to HTML as "code"

Ken once bought a small mountain of Whiteclaw and held it in our dorm
lmfao
- cse prof
"I live right by the Safeway, so feel free to stop and say hi to me, and don't feel ashamed if you're buying Whiteclaw because I buy Whiteclaw too"
congrats
it's great being right
he probably checked true then checked participation and it changed his answer instead of adding a 2nd response
and we can check more than one box
we have to check the participation option
typically though
yes we know this
Taylor polynomial is a series that basically can be used to describe a function
That‚Äôs true though

I just spent 4 hours cramming for the quiz I was supposed to have tonight before checking my email and realizing HE MOVED THE DATE
<:oroBless:700461437977624616>
I put down every single option for lecture/quiz they gave me
everyone pray for a spot to open for me
I guess fuck the incomings amirite

the one i got was better actually
i already looked at that chegg answer
as an apology here's a chegg answer
what is the resolution on that picture
LMFAO
***MY PRISTINE ONENOTE YOU BASTARD***
BUT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOPE
I THOUGHT THAT WHITENESS WAS IT LOADING WRONG
WHEN I SCROLLED DOWN EARLIER
OH
im missed the windows key lol
uhh
onenote
no
did you see my suprise
min\*A < integral < max\*A
find the area of the domain
find min
find max
but again, i understand the process
then chegg showed me why i'm an idiot that iddnt need to do all that math
what happened, as you can see with the math crossed out in yellow, is that the double derivative test for that equation would always return 0 so i decided the equation was ass

the uw town hall
I haven't heard about that
<@!340319804747415553> do you have any sources on the autumn quarter thingy
how is that not evident
a mental breakdown
<@!110137446053736448> I just came back what happened
with like a couple of exceptions for majors that need labs
so then admin backtracked and moved fully online
that was what we were originally gonna do but then people were upset that they'd have to physically be in vancouver even if most of their classes would be online
they're lowering some class capacities for in-person sections and running a lot of classes online still
it was announced in the town hall a while back
we're on hybrid system
i havent heard anything about it, so i'm assuming they have room assignments in the event that we can open campus, but are also preparing for the likely event that campus will still be closed
is UW planning on having in-person classes?
today's mood
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
i can hold a 4 credit class
what is it
anyone got enough space to hold something for me lol
ye
yall juniors or smth
oh mine was last fri

Aw Fran
CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCILL ME
BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
wouldn't take long
do you want me to program Starbot to do these operations
Fun fun
We did that for chem
Oh
lol just plug and chug idiot
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
the day a cute girls do mathematics show is made is the day I start to like math
But man those integrals are distracting
I wanna say that the girl is cute
<@173668455856340994>
<:bruh:703873026684616729>
idk
maybe cause its really small compared to an ocean wave?
reasons and stuff
uhhhhhhhhhhh
<@110137446053736448>
why's it called a microwave if the waves are a meter long
Cooking and cleaning are good, and sometimes I just mindlessly scroll through Pinterest
So like anything but reading, math, or listening to music w words on top of it
I can do anything that doesn't involve processing other words/numbers
dont know what activity i could do that strikes that balance for me
but also get bored if im not doing that
i, too, cannot listen to music or do anything uring lectures
Nobody asked but I found it to be an interesting self-analysis idk if anyone else can relate, I find it extremely difficult to literally just sit and watch
Long tangent to say that cooking while watching lectures is nice and hits that sweet spot of wow I'm actually absorbing information
I get too bored if I'm not doing something else but if the other thing takes up too much brainpower then it's also bad like I can't read stuff while listening
Actually tbh this applies to pretty much every class I've ever taken just to a slightly less noticeable degree in person
This probably sounds very backwards
I've learned that I can't not be doing something else at the same time as watching/listening to video lectures or I'll stop focusing
FUCK PHYSICS
SAY IT WITH ME NOW
YAAAAAY
oof
ü•µ
so my second physics midterm just went really really badly üôÉ
oh no my cat lady is showing
i would say there's still a reasonable level of risk
the risk won't definitively go down till we get an effective vaccine
hm

but it's okay!
your job will include taking minutes and making sure the organization doesn't get put on suspension because you forgot to file paperwork
welcome to secretary life
nice
congrats babe!
frat secretary woopwoop
first college club election and it already looks much better than my hs election record
canass
why is canvas not letting me download videos
[20-??] is considered not a child but also not quite an adult
[15-19] is considered idiot
[1-14] is considered baby
what's going on!!!
Good save
figuratively
fuck middle schoolers
I‚Äôm more of a [7, 18] kind of gal
?
Huh
Acceptable ages of children:
(4-11], [15-18)
nah I'm a spicy soul
... wanna switch nicknames?
*salty and homicidal are not mutually exclusive
*not actually homicidal just salty
but w/e who gives a shit
I don't remember the name but it goes something like "A then B does not prove B then A"
and what you've described there is something like the directional fallacy
I would respond with a laugh but something about violence directed towards children makes me think otherwise
I'd make it a scream of agony if I could
so excuse me for not being on top of my terminology game
you know what I just woke up thanks to this dumbass toddler and haven't taken math in a year
a scream of agony or a scream of joy?
stats has rotted my brain
maybe i'm wrong
tsk tsk
it's association != causation
that's not a correlation at that point
I hate children and hate myself and I am a child, but correlation =/= causation
but just a r/iam14andthisisdeep thought
not directed at you
if you hate children and you hate yourself does that mean that you are a child
I hate children
no time like now to scream in the void
because
I was taking a nap
screaming outside my wiindow
a kid

unrelated: I cant read the word "yamero" in any voice other than a masculine anime voice
we never saw them again
I start going on about how much it means to me and my family before Fran stops me
"My mom and dad practice it."
"Oh, how did you get into it?"
one of the dudes laughs and the one talking to me kinda has a nervous smile
"I'm super into anime thighs."
I respond simply
fran responds with this super polite explanation about how he was raised religiously and studied it in high school but then decided it wasn't for him
heheheh yeah i remember that
"Are you two religious in any way?"
the exchange was something like
as a semi-related note that kinda reminds me about the time Fran and I were approached by two guys looking to get us into their religious organization thingy
yamero
"Oh Alan you're making me all hot and bothered" *blushes*
<:thonk:702395981903429732>

it's not really the place for kindness
soo
and push more
they may take it as reciprocated feeling
a lot of the time
but then again if you show any kindness
honestly
trying to think of a way to be kind
im just trying to think how i would respond if it ever happened

case and point?
case an point
still ambiguous
case n point
I meant as spoken
you added to many
only reason its not is cause of your apostrophes
thats ambiguous
I always thought it was "Case 'n' Point"
"What does case and point mean? Case and point is a misspelling of the expression case in point. It is considered a spelling error."
https://writingexplained.org/case-in-point-case-or-case-and-point
fuck I'm wrong
idk
doesn't it go "case and point" not "in"
Case in point: me

I never met my neighbors
i just feel like the food plans aren't really worth it
Ah
i don't mind the dorms that much
Although I'm just speculating
And I doubt freshies you don't know make great neighbors all the time
It's probably cause they're overpriced
Man why does everybody hate the dorms anyways?
I mean $300 a month is kinda a lot more
Bruh you gonna live in a high rise
is only $300 more a month than my poplar dorm

this is the logical conclusion
so russian men do not exist
but not russian and man
you theoretically can represent any network of relationships this way
there seems to be a lot of connection between russian and woman
a vertex is any one thing and an edge is a connection between two things
a graph is a way of structuring data as "vertices" and "edges"

making a frat discord?
oh man

turns out there were comments directly on the pdf
9/10
huh, I guess that's all you need to know
ah yes very help many thank
But also lmao
Which is fair
And they gave us a diagram
Does Gertrude boil at a higher temp than yenrab
we had a molecule comparison that was like

unless you're a fantasy writer
Yes
and not exactly practical testing now, is it?
that's wack
hmmm
IMAGINE A UNIVERSE WHERE THERE ARE THREE UNIQUE ELECTRON SPINS. DETERMINE THE BOND ORDER OF LiO
As in like
whaddo you mean by imaginary universe
Okay I can kinda say that the imaginary universe thing prevent cheating but also like the instructions are never written well
How was this a good idea
Like
Ahhhh
3) questions that take place in imaginary universes which is just dumb
2) unclear questions where they sent the clarification out 2-3 mins before the test ended
1) people couldn‚Äôt load certain diagrams. They sent out the diagrams after the test was due.
go for it
About online tests
Can I just rant for a sec
Okay fr

starbot has good taste in some places
THATS JUST AMMO STARING YOU IN THE FACE
JUST LOOK AT THE PROM PICS
if we were an anime then you'd be the fanart couple
i've always suspected starbot to be guilty of shitty taste
Because you and Jarrett ship you and Jarrett
bc that's the server OTP
My question is why the heck does starbot ship me and jarrett
Well that's not very cash money of you is it
._.
i regret my pun choices
i will leave now
...
he wants that good RAM
he wants those sexy server upgrades
he just wants that sugar daddy, cindy
I have no problems with this

Im still in my pajamas
To be fair

we're in quarantine
Why would I be sleeping
Bruh it's 4:30

perfect match for Jiayi
I'm just amazed Jarrett is awake at this hour
like the original families were like perfectly chill w it
(which tbh isn't even *that* bad)
yikes
and also some of them are throwing a hissy fit over the pricing
and like some of the kids want to be in the same session and like there's some serious sucking up happening
and they spilled the beans hard to their friends over the call
ok so she's currently tutoring 2 kids
`shota hours` yikes
i saw that
wtf jarrett
how so
and damn there is some hot HOT drama starting up
and now she has more kids wanting to tutor w her
so my mom has been tutoring some students from her pre-k class
Then you'll know
Go to teemo.gg and look up the 3d model
what's the blue flappy part
bootiful
The official quarantine walking uniform
lol
its prep for a coding contest
at that point its not just a test
you get one week to study all the content, and have that entire week to work on the final
i mean
***O N L Y C O D E***
*ONLY CODE*
marathon style class
NO SLEEP
ONLY CODE
i doubt itll be that way
I don't want to have to take 47 hours of a 48 hour CS test
thats very nick of you to say
ol; shioshetoi;zshetoo:EBTgo;B
chem btw
an 8 hour window for a test that took him most of 7
and are no longer curving the class
nick, on the other hand, ahd
and they changed the name from exam to "weekend assessment"
üëÄ
wuh
why?
- 48 hours with a 48 hour window
lmao
- 2 hours with a 48 hour window
- 1 hour with a 24 hour window
my cs exam went from

What time do you go to sleep usually?
I still normally get up early to do work
Also praying is best done at night
So this tends to work better for me
I find that I cant really start work until its evening
like ask Gabe why I can hear him mashing his controller from my bed
it's ok, I'll find something to do to pass the time
Natural light aint start for another hour and a half buddy
I find I like natural light more for getting stuff done
he wakes up when I'm about to pass out
also I'm 95% sure noah and I are on literal opposite sleep schedules rn lmfao
(I'm dying send help)
meeeeeeeeeeee
Bruh it feels like the quarter finished early too
mine is dying a slow and pitiful death
for us semester people
most of the comments are just. coronavirus
same but like 2 weeksago
Hm interesting that this video popped up now in my reccomendations feed
So now I just put white noise on in the background
Generally I don‚Äôt like total silence
But I don‚Äôt typically need to concentrate that hard
When I really concentrate on solving a problem I like silence
i dont like silence
as much as i like silence
i have grown to appreciate the silence
distracting?
why not?
Like I said I don‚Äôt listen to music much anymore since I don‚Äôt really study to music
This year for me is going to be much lower ._.
tbh some days I don't play anything at all but other times I have something running in the background like the entire time I'm awake
2020 is prob gonna be higher
that's pretty wild
2019 averaged about 4.5 hours per day
it's kinda crazy if I think about it and do the math
i'm probably not anywhere near those numbers
Def over 60k for sure
P sure I was always in the 65k to 80k range each year
Idk I find listening habits so interesting
And then 2019 is when I started driving and taking transit a lot
Slight decrease in 2017 bc I stopped gaming as much
I think 2016 was when I got premium
Wait really Salina idr what were your listening stats I'm curious
nvm
hey this was for photography actually
wow you are so bored
it was a pain in the ass
yeah I fuckin did
did you actually change outfits like 10 times for that lol
lmaooo
i thought all of them were your cousins at first and was about to yell at you to social distance
me and the boys during quarantine
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è i keep accidentally sending emails to my professors from my personal email
but also stopped doing that as much lol
i need to do that more
i'm always exploring new artists and stuff
rip
ah
so then im screwed for a while
there's been years when i beat out cindy for hours listened
and get kinda tired of it
so i tend ot listen to just one playlist
like when studying
theres some music i can and cant listen to in certain situations
i used to listen to so much
at least in my experienc
you gotta tread the line of listening to music
which tbh kinda makes me sad
yeah i've listened to a lot less music than before bc i stopped listening to music while studying
ah that's fair
so
that's waht i do
i mean
this music reminds me of when i listened to edm while studying
yeah
discord broken
also that's weird
honestly surprised you caught onto "funca"
i'm listening along but im not showing up
:(
they teach bad
that's what we learned in class
vernacular takes experience
._.
im kidding
ü§¢
no te quiero ver decir "telefono celular"
telefono o celu
espera un minuto

üò¶

According to Epidemiology we may have some measure of social distancing until 2022
you ever wish every single math lecture on every single day for every single time slot didnt show up on canvas
Good work
nice
me drumming on my desk made my fitbit hit a step milestone
hes right
holy shit
from Fran's view its a person becoming slowly more and more abstract
lol
\
Imma be here in UW Online for anyone wanting to be unproductive together
ok
hey look we make a gradient
Rip

But are we rooting for you?
Give it your best shot
:(

Santa jhin is coming to town?
a very appropriate red and white
i was also dressed
Lmao
Fran is giving even less fucks than I am
was fun
this past monday i went for a walk in my work-in-progress mask
i have stopped giving all fucks and just go out in pajamas now for walks
i do that mondays
my walking outfits have been absolutely on point lately
go for a walk
get dressed anyways
im loving wearing pajamas all day
what
that's a mood
rip
i miss getting dressed in the morning
And the situation definitely doesn't look good for the US, we're the leading country in death count now, granted we're definitely one of the bigger countries of course but still not a good look
My mom's that way
Yeahhh honestly that's a good move though, people gotta stop reading so much of the news because it only makes people more anxious
Metro Boston has about the same population as BC Canada but 17x the number of cases per capita
Like I said a while ago I kinda got mentally exhausted and stopped following coronavirus news as closely but today I finally kinda got a sense of the scale of how shit the situation is in population hubs in the US
no go shove that semicolon where its supposed to be
damn you're right
hmm
they're busy plagiarizing you
half an hour goes by and not a word has been said
they tell me to post for help on the board and that they'll pass on my code to the others
you coulda been that TA
I ask a TA for their advice and they don't know why my solution isn't working
I spend 2 hours attempting to solve their buggy code problem
today in Alan does CSE
I will die
If that happens
a lot of colleges are thinking of making fall online too
Take it w a grain of salt tho
Rumor has it UW might be online thru fall quarter
Wowzah
I start summer term may 7th
Im done with class

wow very early
Fuck I have finals this week
Wow I have eight weeks of class left
Wow I have two weeks of class left

speaking of which <@!110137446053736448> are you done with part 3 yet
watch
JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE
sounds like a good candidate for a...
shounen action shows that have made up words for attacks?
lmao i mostly watched shounen action anime that had lots of made up words for attack sequences
so words that go into everyday language are more common in my media consumption
another note about the specialization thing is that I watch almost exclusively slice of life shows
or something
"And so she registered for Japanese 101, a decision which will haunt her well into the future."
that might be funnier
would that make for good entertainment?
what if I narrated your life instead?
you know i'm not sure where i was going with this
jk that would probably end up super boring
in english
i can voice act my life
I'm like 25% of the way there
if I can one day reach a level of comprehension to listen to Kaguya-sama's online web radio then I've achieved my goal
jarrett fuck off
lmao otaku meaning otaku
what is a voice actor?
seiyuu meaning voice actor and otaku meaning otaku
what is a seiyuu?
a combination of the words seiyuu and otaku
seiota?
I'm starting to become a seiota and as a result I need to know a bit more actual Japanese to know what's going on
what's all of our weeb levels?
and specialization
I'd wager it's more aligned to weeb level
cause he watches dubs half the time
except Noah
the levels of japanese in this server are directly correlated to the amount of anime watched
Yup
"kekkou desu" would also suffice
so like chinese then
Use "yaritakunai"
ah
For 'I don't want to do something'
these last few comments just confirmed all of you know more about japanese than I do
I think
Like if someone offers to give you something you don't need, you reply with iranai
I'm pretty sure that iranai is only used as a possessive want
"iie
ore wa iranai desu"
fuck really
so uh
okaa-san is for referring to a mother that isn't your own
i guess that would make sense though
babushka
okaa-san no okaa-san
i.e. I can tell you how to order food at a restaurant but I can't tell you what the word for grandma is
not course-oriented vocab
problem is that half my vocab is weeb-based vocab
writing is non-existent
well, maybe my listening and speaking is higher than that
I got like half of 101 down
aint you better than japanese 101 at this point Alan?
i dont want to
nah
uhh
what
ore wa iranai desu
iie
you guys wanna hop on the advanced weeb train?
<@!173668455856340994> <@!233062637922025472> helen and I are gonna take Japanese 101 starting next year
YESSSSS MY PSYCH PROJECT DEADLINE WAS EXTENDED BY A DAY WOOOOOOO
having a partner is just for problem discussion
in cse many of the couches I can move myself, and most of em are even designed for one person
depends on the couch
<@!478706068223164416> gonna get a partner when you need to move a couch?
man of course comp sci would create a discord
same options apply to getting a partner
do I join it
1. now
2. when I have a problem I can't solve myself
3. never
someone in cse 373 started a discord
I‚Äôm channeling inner Hermione Granger energy
Heavily contemplating asking for permission to take two overlapping classes
then they'd be engaging in dangerous activity and not following social distancing guidelines
What if they were selling shampoo
^
what if they had an emergency and you could have just saved someone's life
well I assume the person knocking on your door had some actual logistical reason for knocking, not something related to your appearance
why?
this logic confuses me
Someone knocked on my door but my hair is greasy as hell and I generally look like a disaster so I think I'm just gonna ignore it lmao
ok iconic
wow my stats prof is really posting 12 minute videos in place of 75 minute lectures huh
I'm super down
Hmmm I just played scribble.io yesterday so that‚Äôs an idea
what games are you thinking
could prob get my hands on more but honestly idk if it's worth the trouble
I ran out of alcohol :(((
Guys we should do a drunk video call and play online group games this weekend
I can see the future

You never jack off at four pm so that you dont feel the urge at 4 am?
you gotta tenderize it *first*
it's like starting drinking at 12 am
then how do you cook the steak?
waht you gonna wait till after dinner?
if you're beating your meat at 4 pm you got some problems
bruh it's 4 in the afternoon
very blunt suggestion
that was a uh
relieve stress
work some upper body
should recuperate energy
some good steak
meat tenderizer
beat your meat
or really do anything else other than projects, school and video games
need to work out
I'm slowly running out of steam

my ideal schedule
*almost*
lmao
My schedule is almost symmetrical
gl!
i need to call my academic advisor via landline in two minutes
lol congrats
now in engl class woo?
nope
no english for you
?
have you been sent a meeting link
no zoom meeting exists
i have english class in two minutes
so
***HMMMM***
*hmmmm*
hm
lmao you guys
hop in amigo
<@!110137446053736448> call?
there is no limit to human stupidity
i feel bad for the prof tho
they just watch the recording at the normal time lol
no idea
why does anyone care
well then
oh
oh
plus all lectures/quiz sections are uploaded and no attendance is mandatory in the class
which i think is understandable
the TA is in a timezone where doing 8:30 fucks w their planning and sleep sched
wtf
and i feel so bad
thats super legit reason to be mad and super stupid of the prof
and she's like the sweetest human being and just apologizing to everyone about the trouble
ppl are mad at my prof bc all the quiz sections got moved an hour later and it's fucked w ppl's schedule
at least my teaher seems pretty excited about the material
Sorry to hear that
Ouch
physics is gona be the organizational nightmare it was born to be
:D
reading the first 3 lines i see it is quite exciting
ahh i'm excited
üëç
aight
and you can also cross check when you actually changed
bc it'll help you prove "significant changes" more easily
when you submit the assignment keep a copy of the assignment backed up and do edits on another copy of the doc
bc i would've found this helpful when i did my portfolio
one tip tho
oh!
i can still get into my old class's canvas and i have all the files backed up
if you want resources for the class lmk
yeah that's a yikes
the "research" paper weeks take longer
we'll see though
they take like maybe an hour or two most weeks
seems the teacher might be a lil anal
the way everything else in course descriptio nwas worded though
okay
hm
and it's 70% for every comp class
those are weekly assignments
oh
üëÄ this sounds very not many fun
"missing one short or major assignment leads to a failing portfolio" (70% of the grade)
also
was not updated for quarantine
descrip[tion
my engl comp
it appears
oooh
i'm so here for it
theme is literature and war
canvas just released for my engl class and IT IS LIT
this is what it was for contrast
cse 373 is considering moving to posted lectures
math's monday meeting is the only mandatory meeting
art 140's monday meeting is optional
my actual schedule for spring
Hmph lol
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmhm
Salina

you and my sister
oh god
maybe closer to 7 or 8
I've put maybe 6 hours a day average into the game since it launched
y i k e
oh no
animal crossing is a hell of a drug
should we be concerned???
> coming from someone who got away with murder
you seem a bit cracked out
right
what has happened to you during quarantine
but don't forget lab is canceled the first week
alan
makes more sense but still weird
and some other random days
oh weird
midterms
thats only for week 1
ah
and a 4th lecture
1 qs
happened?
1 lab
what uh
you doing ok there?
3 regular lectures
also alan
i'm so confused
like what is that last section
FUCK PHYSICS
YEAH
it's.... 3 lectures, 1 lab, 1 quiz section, 1 ???????
coming from someone who got away with murder
physics is wack
why is physics so wack yikes
but ty for the suggestion
not gonna do that
well my man
chegg can
does someone want to save me from the fresh hell that's triple sci?
doesn't bode well for next year tho hmm
but this works well for quarantine
rip

then go to sleep only once after it
wtf
............................................................
so why not just stay up until my class
but if I go to bed now I'm gonna be tired when I get up for it and then go back to asleep afterwards
geez
I have class at 7:45
let me live *mom*
ok well you can bask in the genius of this move as well then
im in bed
love you too
hmm -_-
wait a minute
i here
hi
but I just had the best idea
<@!503787499605458954> you're the only one up so you're the only one I can talk to about this
i see that they're on tft
we in Friends Under Common Knowledge
but i'm back now
they're all gone
now that helen and I are out
y'all can/should switch over to the regular group
I just left bc I have to call my sis
Salina's taking a break but Fran + Jonathan are in her planning server playing league
and now everyone is gone
aww I'm finally back
did you hear me talking about avocados
who just joined and left
yeeee join our voice channel
also hi I'm back
damn get that COIN
https://clips.twitch.tv/ShyNeighborlyGrasshopperSaltBae
now this person has the right idea $25 per game
depends on how much you're making
would you be ok if i went on egirl.gg :p
twitch isn't where the money is now, egirl.gg is where it's at
Cindy prolly isn‚Äôt tho
I‚Äôm back
we can discuss our plans to become twitch streamers ^^
yayyyyyyyyy üôÇ
yeah probably!
alrightalright
ok imma leave now but i'll be back in about 30 if you guys wanna vc?
aww cute
and it's so wholesome omg
susan's friend asked her to be a bridesmaid
omg speaking of married
L
no thanks I'm not ready to envision a world where my friends are like getting married n shit
well try 26 on for size
rip?
ain't that the truth
18 year olds are fake adults
practically no but technically yes
I'm *technically* an adult
an adult
and she is
my mom is super freaked out about susan
but ngl it gets annoying sometimes
yeah that's true
which like I'm willing to do for her peace of mind
ok
she probably misses you
rip?
her condition for me staying and having Freedom is that she wants to call me EVERY DAMN NIGHT
maybe we can congregate again after cindy and i are back?
lmao
my parents want me to exercise with them
lol
I have to call my mom in 14 ugh
i might have to leave for a bit soon
it'd kinda a pain to go back and forth btwn game and chat
do yall wanna just vc?
it's rude if i claim they are shorter than they think they are
noah is like the main reason I round to 5'6 now bc he keeps saying we're the same height but I'm p sure I'm slightly shorter
mainly because some girls clearly shorter than me claim to be 5'7" or 5'8" so in order to keep it to scale i just round up
lol i round to 5'8" sometimes
extra flex factor
you should
but i don't wanna
just round to 5'11"
and time of day
bc noah tells me to
i'm something like 5'7.5" it depends on the measuring tool used
iconic that you know the decimals
i'm not flat 5'10"
most discord servers have a bunch of people you dont know irl
somewhere in there
5' 10.5-75"
why is my internet so shit üò†
you're 5'10" right
I mean we started w like 16? which is still p small as far as discord servers go
average male height is 5'9" in the US
also jarrett is taller than me too
not anymore :(
true
there are not very many people in this server
it's p much just us at this point lol
i was just about to say, "you're taller than your boyfriend, that's all that matters'
there's more guys than girls in this server
noah is my small boi
**most**
there are not very many guys in this server
fran's taller
salina, not helen
you're still taller than most of the guys in this server tbh
it wasn't?
and then
i figured my height is around the average human height including both males and females
oh fair
you're still basically the tallest girl around
bc all the guys grew taller
why not?
loool
... now i'm not
i used to be on top of the world
i lost those after middle school
man
bragging rights
being tall doesn't have a ton of benefits?
bc...
why are you of all people saying that
who needs height
i might as well stream a journey to tft plat ngl
lmao
also true
aw I miss you guys ü•∫
when we're doing twitch livestreams being tall won't matter anymore
HAHAHAHAHA
thanks
notification on my phone looked very promising
statistically I'm 95% sure helen says owo far more than the rest, tbf
god fucking dammit helen I will find you
hahahahaaaaa
just pulled the age old "which tall asian is which" bamboozle
ah alan has upgraded starbot it seems

i'm not helen
god fucking dammit helen I will find you
me: where did my cursor go owo
but like i would be fighting and the camera would swing around
I've been meaning to get a new one soonish
yeah prob the move
i think it'd be a lot easier w console bc sticks
get a controller?
the aiming is kinda fucky on pc ngl
i like the games where i farm, kill animals and build house
oh huh
I thought it was ps4
yeah
is that on steam?
i got 3 of the games for a bday present
help me w darksiders
wanna...
maybe i'll get in on this animal crossing thing if i can be bothered to buy a nintendo switch
laughs in tft
it depends what kind of game it is I usually pick up action-related/adjacent stuff p fast
but i am really good at strategy games
im not that good at *game* games
the only games i really have are minecraft and stardew valley
well not like i'm any competition in the first place
.... me
loool
but guess who did
... on easy mode
at least you didn't fail the tutorial of darksiders
i'm willing to bet salina is the best gamer here
cindy
all my makeup is still at school :(
also false it's been a LONG time
oh god
we could be like a twitch girl group
brooooo I'm still in schooooool
cindy is the only one with the real skillz here
lmao
ALL THREE OF US SHOULD DO IT
helen let's go
YES
should i get in on this too
yikes?
okie can do üôÇ
honestly not that much just like cute makeup n shit, occasionally interacting w the desperate men in your chats
lmao
depends on what activities thirst trapping involves
what level of creepiness would make you uncomfortable
are you willing to thirst trap for $$$?
*cindy*
well it depends what's your goal
dude no kidding I would be so down to help w this
so what should i avoid doing based off of her experience?
and fly out halfway across the country to meet a 35ish old man
who actually did/does stream games
don't pull a cindy xiao
now helen
oh god
i will need some sort of tripod/camera stand so i can get a nice angle
but throwing cars at a boss's face is hard
get people to send you bits for the opportunity to help you in whatever game
i shouldn't be struggling this bad
omg speaking of being bad at games i'm like struggling to beat the first level of darksiders
get the cat ear headphones for Maximum Effect
who needs skillz
LMAO
my whole brand will be i have no idea what the shit i'm doing on the game but i'm cute
both of you do it
and charge money for playing w others
i'm a support bitch and some league friends are telling me to be an egirl
d o  i t
i'm seriously thinking about it
do it
LMAOOO
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
i'm also thinking of becoming a twitch streamer and capitalizing off of being a girl
it's all a cry for help
that's also cool
help me
i've been making lego mosaics
that's not weird that's hella cool
a few days ago i bought a pot of dip ink and started doing calligraphy
same
i started getting bored of my early quarantine days activities so my hobbies have gotten increasingly weird since then
rip?
hmm bit early in the quarantine for that
my actual mental stability is far more in question
have you and your laptop merged entities already?
that's what I meant
yeah
more importantly, is your laptop fine
I'm both exhausted and super hyper rn
you don't sound like you're fine üòõ
I think
for now
I'm good
but it's fine
it was more of a yell of anguish
the first scream i imagined was not very cindy-like so i had to revise it
is it hard? lol
i'm trying to envision that in my head
I'm not having it today
my laptop fell off my bed and I screamed
Sounds like a fun prof
Hahahaha animal crossing
also she frequently assumes that her whole class is very left politically, and while some definitely are I also definitely don't think it's the majority (while I was pushing back on some of what she said a bunch of people agreed w me). it bothers me more bc I feel like it discourages other people with different opinions from speaking than bc I personally disagree. she acts like everyone who doesn't share her views is flat-out wrong
maybe I'm the one with a small brain but she just seems to have such a narrow, black-or-white kind of wordview and it genuinely pisses me off
mildly angry intellectual arguing
angry arguing or intellectual arguing
lmao
I was planning to just attend my online classes and lay in bed and listen to the lectures like a podcast but my soci prof got me fired up and arguing w her in the chat oop
üòÇ
"i don't want this to be recorded but does anyone have animal crossing???"
"alright guys we're about done for today. I'm gonna end the recording now..."
that's kind of iconic
My stats prof is such a clown, he made this background in MS Paint

the future of teaching
I chose Japanese for obvious reasons
For me it comes down to which culture am I more interested in
i was trying to decide between korean and japanese:
- both are considered easy A
reasons for Korean:
- i know of more people taking korean and they all like it
- simpler writing system
- I hear more korean than japanese in daily life
- korean 101 fits my schedule as shown above but japanese 101 is incompatible with some other classes
reasons for japanese:
- professor has more good reviews on rate my professor
- easier to pronounce
- japan is more fun to travel to than korea
- understanding anime is more useful than understanding kpop, though i don't watch much anime nowadays

I think it all comes down to, do i want to be a weeb or koreaboo more?
Building my schedule for next fall. 16.25 credit hours -- how does this look?
ayyy nice!
(there goes even more of my motivation though lmao)
GOD BLESS
WE'RE GETTING A PASS/FAIL OPTION
idk, but I assume they're out too
why would they not also be cancelled
How‚Äôre AP exams?
Oh the poor poor souls
Skyline isn't having online classes they're just indefinitely out of school
Idk how anything is gonna work for current HS students
They're prob gonna get moved, maybe put online somehow? This def qualifies for the natural disasters/catastrophe reason for reschedule lmao
That doesn't surprise me

or did you order 20 something pizzas from Poggliachi
Yup
from the DM?
Literally $200 of food
A lot of food
what on earth did you end up buying
I coulda had steak at least once if it wasnt closed
Man I had to spend $200 of dining hall money today
you know what we're just gonna put that down as a "missed yet not missed opportunity"
I have yet to have cultivate steak
And we shall also note
smfh
**boy**
That remains to be seen
So
I aint never had your burgers
lolll
JARRETT
are you saying my cooking is worse than local point
I cook at home
Well I was more thinking about whatever home cooking is for you
because that's a high-tier insult
are you implying that there's a possibility that whatever food I can get access to in Sammamish is worse than Localpoint and Cultivate
hold on
wait
did you really have to add the "in my opinion" part
-money
-worse food (in my opinion)
-literally nobody there
Do consider Alan
so a double is even more
I thought you meant total
Ah
actually not quite but yeah
That's about right
Wait
Oh what
i was thinking that a triple was 950ish per month
Yee
You mean like $3000?
it's like 3k sorry
oh
?
he's in a double
$1000?
That‚Äôs an extra like $1000 for 2.5 months
Okay but also
- quiet space to work with no distractions
- having my own place
Is there even a point to it?
I mean
still thinking about it
Why are you even staying?
jarrett isn't staying either
i'm not staying
Ken is, and that kinda leaves my rooming situation up in the air

clean my room (i was about to do that anyway)
weed the garden

and now that my parents aren't avoiding me anymore my mom keeps trying to talk to me and ask me to do stuff
there's no reason for me to be in most of the house, i only need my room

why?
of course i did get to go outdoors
tbh i liked being quarantined in my room more than free reign of the house

I expect vancouver to do the same in a few weeks, but we're a while behind on the infection timeline
there should already be upper thousands of cases
yea esp since we're the other main hotspot
yeah
i feel like washington is reacting way too slowly
I feel like it's pretty inevitable though especially if SF is doing it
yeah me neither helen
the wang sisters futilely attempt to escape quarantine: the electric boogaloo
i can't find any news on it rn
okay thanks guys
so take it w a grain of salt
i mostly heard thru the chinese parent grapevine but idk how true it is
yeah
i know that restaurants and gyms and stuff are being forced to close
how do you know?
i heard we might start similar measures tomorrow
Does Seattle have similar things in place??
Rip economy
Makes sense
Update: Canada is closing borders except with the US, but that's expected to happen soon as the US becomes Italy 2.0

I love being absolutely spammed about my grades being referred
I went back outside and MY ALLRRGIES ARE SO BAD RN FUCK
i thought about getting a job as a starbucks barista or something, but i imagine that those kinds of jobs might be even harder to find because existing employees will try hard to keep their jobs
this feels like a very late response
i'm confused why nowhere in king county is in lockdown yet
prob not too hard
w the coronavirus going around
i need to get a job
that would be so sad and boring
i just hope my internship won't be impacted so that we have to work from home or something
it's fine
yeah
I was also planning to go home in between but probably not happening anymore
i mean the lockdown won't be affecting your plans really
well even better
might be here till june
I was planning to do first summer term
ehhhh
you won't be stuck there for longer than how long your academic semester was supposed to be
I honestly feel like we might murder each other if kept in close quarters too long though lmao I'm good on my own
and also vancouver will probably also get locked down in ~2 weeks
on one hand it kinda sucks to be the only one of y'all who's not gonna be around
my mom's been trying pretty hard to get me to come home
lol
it was kinda funny to watch
whenever one of us got picked up at the airport the parents come down and spray down the kid and the luggage
i travelled with two friends and our parents were all in cahoots with each other
ok fair
yeah
what, the seattle airport?
i think it's a legitimate response consider i travelled through the most dangerous place in the US
a lot more dramatic than I was expecting
that is
damn
my parents bring my food on trays to my door lmao
but i do get to take walks outside which is all i really need
wait actually??
for probably 3-5 days
i'm forbidden from leaving my room
no nothin
no herc
so no noah
ive been forbidden from leaving the house
bad
how's the quarantine going folks
gets warm super fast. this has been my extremely inconsequential ramble of the day
tbf I think part of the problem is that I'm incapable of not walking at an Accelerated Pace
lol
and also windy
idk why but I have a really hard time dressing for when it's <10 degrees but super sunny

it's already halfway there
we're gonna make covid-19 an STD

chinese bills would scratch so bad
it's also holographic so it'd make me sad to deface it

toilet paper is gonna be worth more than money, so we can all wipe our asses with the paper bills instead

it's gonna be high school 2.0 except better
let's have a group study party
i have a brilliant idea
What the
my mom says a friend of hers said her kids said that stanford has cancelled spring quarter.
i will obviously not take this at face value as a lazily brief google search does not corroborate it but i'd just like to put it out there
I p much wanna specialize in East Asia or East Europe relations, haven't decided which yet though
I actually like the topic though it's about how China's geopolitical powerhas changed since 1945
I can write pretty fast these days but doing it this early is p unusual
It's due Friday
and you say no regardless!

you;ll just say no
False and you know it
but if i dont make it relative
i would just ask if you're a functional human being
is your essay due in like an hour or are you just more functional of a human being than i am
holy
Just cranked out like 2000 words
It's weird
Ok but I've been astoundingly productive today
you told me i should be sad
i'm joking
?
how could u do this to me
fran
aw
not sure why i said it like that
correct
bc double neg?
so it should?
it shouldnt not
but that still makes me sad
that's fair
:(
she is having breakfast
she is breaking her fast
is the most dictionary answer as to what meal she's having
cindy saying she's having breakfast
response was not the right word
no i mean
i'm an unoriginal ho
sorry
to what meal she's boutta have
textbook definition response
the most
"breakfast"
kay Imma get breakfast now I guess lol
it's been 1-2 gens mostly
decades yeah
and this is after decades (not sure of that number) of forcing one child
the sheer size of both the consumer market and labour force make its economic superpower status kinda inevitable
side note I find it kinda depressing that ~~one of~~ the primary reasons China has so much economic power is just. how many fucking Chinese people there are

make your prof go
quick now credit me in your paper
üëç i edited
üëç i helped/s
thanks guys
yeah that's a helpful restructuring
ooh salina nice
ye i kind of agree
i agree
> leadership of a company
that sounds weird. hard to think of another way to write it while making the stuff around it make sense but that gets me
entrance into china would guarantee an influx of revenue high enough to motivate a company's leadership--whose founding principle was "don't be evil"--to allow censorship of the CCP's forced "re-education" of Uighur Muslim minorities in Xinjiang
I'm using it as a case study for the economic influence of China's market size
my biggest concern with studying german is that i mgiht start captializing nouns randomly in english
yes this is about Google's project dragonfly
I just feel like the wording is awkward but all the info is fairly important
The influx of revenue guaranteed by entrance into China was enough for leadership of a company whose founding principle was ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be evil‚Äù to be willing to censor information on the CCP‚Äôs forced ‚Äúre-education‚Äù of Uighur Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.
hahahaha
ok someone help me edit this sentence down
ah rip fran
"no se lo siento"
i enjoy german but have no room in my schedule to continue past 101 üò¶
"ayudame"
"escandalo"
my spanish has basically just become
i actually really enjoy spanish but there's not much opportunity to practice
ah i see
that translation was bad
mcuh worse*
i feel like
ye
my spanish could be worse enough?
hm
then i spelled letters wrong
tu espa√±ol podria ser bastante peor
lmao
i felt like my hand just laid still on the keyboard for 4 letteres
basura caliente
im surprised i typed that right
lo siento mi espanol es basura
interesting
that's the one that online spanish drilled into me
yeah
alimientos works too
i'm w fran
comida
huh i thought i was remembering wrong
dont justify your actions, correct them
that is the right word for food technically
oh wait
I did have a latte though!
come los alimientos por favor
might help you think more good
food is usually a priority in my lizard brain
*consume*
eat pls
this is highly uncharacteristic
check yoself befo you wreck yoself
yeah I should
üëÄ
go do that
maybe
uh
I just realized I have not eaten anything today
oh gina
of course
actual essay topic:
basically yhe two industries (to my knowledge) at the forefront of shady-shit-doing
that'd be my second
but who knows
i wanted to say oil companies/piplines
drug companies?
nope
also anyone wanna guess what I'm writing about? lmao
is what i'd do
contextually? 
> seek to do
encouraged?
I just feel like with how long the sentence already is I should try to trim that phrase down bc it sounds awk in context
Im trying to be like "[really long conditional clause] was enough for this company's leadership [to be willing to] do [insert bad thing]"
> be willing to
i think i would always write that like that
heheh
other times i hop over his getup attack with ridley downsmash
sometimes i play bowser like a big bitch
more obliging?
what's a more concise way of saying "be willing to"
another thesaurus question
bc i feel that that explains the `suck a big meaty throbbing fat cock`
fran have you been smashing him
it means he gets to die more at the hands of Jimothy Bowser
i kinda like writing pretentiously sometimes though
sounds like UW isolation hasn't been doing you any favors
honestly a mood
you ok there bud
uh
academic tone can go suck a big meaty throbbing fat cock
*academic*
??

thanks
ooh maybe
underlying?
the first word that came to mind was "insidious" but that's not quite what I'm trying to get across either
hmm I'm not trying to say it was particularly subtle just that it didn't get much attention for a long time
subtly?
how do I say "lowkey" in an academic way lmao
profit-driven?
what's a good synonym for "capitalist"/"capitalistic"

daylight savings is seriously fucking me up

<@!110137446053736448> you might actually be interested in using Haskell

java is like learning how to drive a manual car
Honestly the most graphic part is no seat, cause I just imagine the cushion is missing but you know what a bike seat with no cushion is üëÄ

Is no fingers really relevant
Well with no handlebars
you have no fingers

Oh fuxk
or a seat
except there are no handle bars
You keep falling over and skinning your kneecaps for a while but then you get it down, are fully skilled, and never forget?

update
[End Geeky CompSci Stuff]
that's all for now
Starbot's first step to real sentience
basically
the actual implementation for this is an example of a low-level Machine Learning algorithm
the idea is that with enough data, Starbot can use our vocabulary and put it together in ways that, likely, make sense to us
`can` can be followed by `be followed by`
`are` can be followed by `these squirrels doing in my pants`
`the` can be followed by `fuck`
`is` can be followed by `this`
so Starbot picks a word and repeats the process
`is`, `the`, `are`, `can` so on and so forth
possible following words could be
`what`
so, as an example, I had the word
and Starbot makes a map of words to other words that could possibly come after that word
basically how it would work is that Starbot is fed the 15.2 MB worth of text data that Server Backup scraped
and I've come to the conclusion that the first approach I should use is Markov Chains
basically, the idea is that I want Starbot to respond to people using language that is 1) relatable and 2) funny
the Server Backup bot was created as a part of it
the Starbot Natural Language initiative is something I've been looking into for about a month now

"PHILOSOPHY IS LIKE TOK ON CRACK. NOTHING MAKES SENSE." -iconic quote from my friend Suri
"the circle of life makes it sound cheesy and like the lion king" -my prof
7-10 hours is ideal and usually when I will wake up naturally depending on how tired I am
I can easily sleep 10+ hours any given day if you let me but if I sleep Too long (waking up and going back to sleep, Extreme Lazy mode) I'll end up with a headache
naturally late, my ideal sleep schedule is like 3-4 am to 12-1 pm
Salina loves it
I will happily wake up at 2pm
I can‚Äôt go to sleep at 10 but I also always wake up before 9
My ideal sleep time would be 12:30-8:30
Late night league with the boys is amazing
TIL: Cindy had no taste (ok I actually already knew that)
I get my best sleep if I go to bed at like 10 and even if do sleep late I can't usually sleep much last 8 or 9am
Naturally early
My life would be so much easier if days were 27 hours long
If I don't regulate myself with alarms I will sleep 9 hours and be awake for the next 18
Naturally late
i'm doing research on sleep for psych right now and thought of this
also how many hours of sleep is ideal for you?
would y'all categorize yourselves as naturally early or late sleepers?
also i'm kind of curious
you're up at 5:30 am?
And you can hear bird calls echoing around the buildings
Nobody is around
It's foggy as hell
Okay campus is hella nice at this time
get some sleep my dude
yikes
Had to teach myself integrals again
Cause my brother needed like 2 hours of help for math
Fun work times
why are you still in the library anyways
true
Hardcore League players basically practice idolatry
I shudder to think what would happen to me if I insulted the one thing that keeps them going
I've seen these savages known as league of legends players rage over one death
Nah I dont wanna get jumped
you should go up and tell them dota is better lmao
unsure if it's worse than paying for premium porn I'll have to think about that one
correction: playing LoL at 3 am in the library is loser behaviour
To Cindy playing League of Legends is more loser behaviour than paying for premium porn
This just in:
honestly that's kinda crazy but I hope they're having fun
lol
They are all Korean
losers
Within a 20 foot radius there are eight people playing league of legends
At 2:40
I am in the library right now
Good luck

lol my psych professor also cancelled class last week due to her kid
rip?

wasn't gonna go anyways
nice
but no psych
her son is sick rip
whatwhatwhat
what
hallefuckinglujah
no psych tomorrow morning
i'm sorry but
I feel like overloading (personally) would definitely worsen my gpa tbh
i haven't overloaded yet this year, and my first semester gpa is suboptimal so i might want to earn more grades to drown them out
and I still need to fill my lit req which is why I'm probably also gonna take russian lit
to get to 34 i will need to overload at least twice
bc I kinda want to take more than the required 51 IR credits
I'm almost definitely gonna graduate w more than 120 credits
so 21 ib credits + 30 credits from this year + 51 more IR credits + 9 math credits = 111
29 of those done by first year
I will haaaaaaave
the actual split is 41 credits of math/science, 36 credits of CompE stuff, and 36 credits of senior elective stuff
so I have 51 left, + 9 elective credits that I'm gonna fill w math
IR reqs that I've already knocked out:
-6 language credits
-6 history credits
CompE has about ~10 required courses with capstones and math and science or whatever requirements thrown in
63 credits = 21 semester classes (some are full year though)
I already have 51
120 to graduate
63 credits for IR
your cs major is only 11 classes???
psych requires 12 for a BA and probably 16 for a BS
i need 34 to graduate but my CS major only requires 11 classes
PSYCHOLOGY!
why is my baby crying?
PSYCH'S COOL!
lol
brb
you know I don't have that memorized
how many course credits does it require and how many credits to graduate?
is it?
that's pretty insane
whoa is IR literally going to take almost all your classes for the rest of college?
but considering how much I loathe soci that might be a bad idea idk
I've thought about maybe taking a psych class bc personal interest at some point
math 104 and 105
stat 200
russ 265

are the only non-IR classes I'm planning to take after this year I think
i realized it's not a good reason to pursue something when i have a choice to do other things
i "liked" math in high school because i did well in it but without that component i have no motivation to do math
yeah that's important
not just for the sake of gpa; i realized math didn't make me happy and also wasn't very useful to my career
lol
but it also made me make an informed decision on why i shouldn't do a math major
rip
bc it's important but it's not my focus
i could have withdrawn for the sake of my gpa though by the withdrawal deadline i didn't know i wouldn't do well
so I might as well, and I don't wanna worry about it too much
math is like the only thing I'm gonna take that's not explicitly a degree req from here on out though
i mildly regret taking multivariable calc last semester
but we have a limited number of spots
we can if they're outside your faculty / degree reqs
aw we don't get the option of making things pass/fail
that makes it easy to overload with
I think I'm gonna make most of my math classes pass/fail
i might do korean instead because i've heard it's one of the easiest classes at duke
i should start my foreign language next semester
I have to do another year of russian / any language for IR but I have a lot more freedom after this term
i was pretty eager to take econ just to get to know the area but i think i'm going to save it for much later because our econ class is notoriously difficult even though it's pass/fail
same actually
basically i can do whatever the fuck i want from here on out
from now on i'll also have less of a clear cut path in terms of courses since i've done all the intro requirements
ah
i need 34 course to graduate, and 23 of them are going to be taken up by my majors
if I get above a 75 in soci I'll consider it a small miracle
i just pray 3.7+ in bio at this point
idk how UW grades work anymore
L
that's also a mood tho
though that's me in probably at least 1-2 classes this term T_T
love that
lmao I was confuzzled for a sec
hahaha
i'mma just get a B
i'm gonna just get a BA instead of a BS
nice
yep
psych?
gl dude
since i've finally decided on a second major
starting next semester i'm gonna start overloading
though at the time i couldn't have known differently
i also made some unwise/uninformed decisions for first semester courses
like I didn't know better and I also didn't know how many ib credits I was gonna get last june
yeah I've been pissed @ myself about it this entire time lol but it's fine I'll live
ouch
which is pretty sad
not being smart about class choices this year probably set me back half a year
i just knock out of ton of public health credits via premed
... woo?
graduate in 3 years and like 2 quarters
lol
nvm
i uh
since I also wanna co-op and I have my dual
oh you're including masters too
I'm aiming for less than 5 lol
question for all relevant people i guess
so do you get to graduate in 3 years or not lol
^yeah I have the credits to graduate early but gonna be very hard to squish all my requirements into less than 4 years
but a lot of IB credits are lowkey useless
i'm a sophomore too
i mean
you're a sophomore? so you're gonna graduate early then?
anything's valid
comp sci does anything the situation requires
in some spheres
probably are actually
the cornerstones of computer science
integrals and forces
ah yes
I believe in u
but you know what'll be better reassurance? dunking on these two midterms tomorrow
even if it does come from two people who didn't go to UW lol
so it's nice to hear *some* reassurance about my major and career path
whachu mean cindy
`you're a sophomore` never say this unironically please
loser
haha
fuck
<@!470822754262712329> you actually did come up in the conversation tho

you're a *sophomore*
remember alan
I also got to talk to them a lot about my personal situation (even tho I was like the only freshman there)

<@!472541429130854421> pepper?
I'm fine
Salt?
that was a real fast back track
well
you know what idk
maybe
hopefully
I think
but it's fine
mild drama
a quiet war of wills
What just happened lmao
hoi <3
Hello
i think i want to address this privately
actually
go off
not in class anymore
ok so
yikes
:(((
you're gonna be incredibly dry while in politics
suddenly a lot of things make sense huh
yikes
What can I say problem solving really gets me going
so that's the kinda thing you're into, huh?
<@470822754262712329> anything to add?
You're right
Oh
hey Starbot is in this group too
My god did the two biggest dicks in this group just have a mature discussion and come to a compromise?? Miracles do happen
K that's fine. Sorry for doing that without saying anything
yes, dm me about it
I want control over what I say and don't say
I'm sorry I care so much about this but I do
For the record idc if you delete my messages if you think I'm being an ass
Okay so do you want me to dm you next time if there is a next time
if someone is fine with other people deleting their messages, that's their choice. It just isn't my choice, I don't want people to delete my messages
my problem isn't with protecting my discord messages, it's that everyone here is equal, no one has the power to overrule anyone else, we make decisions as a group. If the group feels like something is detrimental it can be removed, not individuals making decisions on what is and isn't detrimental. We all have the power to kick, mute, deleted messages, etc but we don't use them unless the group agrees
Let me be clear that I will only delete your shit if someone asks or if I think it could be genuinely super and unintentionally hurtful to whoever it's @
I sense a wall incoming
But I think I'd rather protect my friends than anyone's discord messages. This is more serious than you think and I'm not gonna elaborate more on that. I shouldn't even have made the original joke/comment
This is not something I generally do
I'm cool w you not being cool w that
the issue with the messages isn't necessarily centered around you
please
sometimes you need to let it go
gdi noah
I've made my thoughts very clear on this
no
please
noah, chill it
I'm not cool with that
that's fair
I will if I think it'll harm someone else
fine, but don't touch my messages
Because I thought it was a bit insensitive and not my place to say anything
I think everyone is aware of my stance on deleting my messages
<@!503787499605458954> why did you delete my and Salina's message?
not that one
no
wait
Buddy despises you
this still doesn't answer my question
there's a lot i wanna say in response to that but i'm kind of in class
I totally get why people wouldnt like him and it's fine if you don't jive well but he deserves respect ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
He's honestly a pretty great person and a huge sweetheart under the stupid jokes
But I am genuinely super happy for Alex, he's found great friends and finally knows what he wants to major in. Also I feel like most of y'all are harsh on him bc you saw him being a sad bitter mess the last year or two of HS while not knowing the whole story or what was going on w him in his personal life
i didn't mean it to pry but more like a damn didn't expect to hear that
that's fair
Not my business to share anything else I feel like I've been pretty open about my mental health taking a Big Hit and you guys have also been wonderful so thanks for that
Well honestly I'm having a pretty shitty semester and he's having a much better one (compared to where we were a few months ago)
what happened to you and helen
damn
The tables have turned he's now the stable supportive and undramatic one in the airpod gang lmao
He's doing well
I feel kinda bad about it
Tbh I haven't talked to him in a while
I have no idea I don't talk about you to him lmao
<@!173668455856340994> 
<@!503787499605458954> 
Alex dislike me any less now?
oh that reminds me
Hahaha
He came up in conversation w Alex the other day and it was the first time I've thought about him in like 2 years
Lol
Rip?
So I left
He invited me then asked to wait 20
He's still playing dota
>3k
I remember Cindy and I like broke off friendships w him real hard
Where is Luke Brandes anyway
Damn
and from this we can determine Luke Brandes has a body pillow
rip
uh
like "owning a body pillow and having < 2k mmr in DOTA are related"
idk why but this makes me want to extrapolate information exclusively with Jarrett's life experiences
Can confirm I sleep a lot and very well
No pillow gang
Learning this was one of the reasons I finally stopped stacking my pillows
Least likelihood of choking and dying but also minimizes snoring and other issues
A lot of sleep studies say that the best way to sleep (for your back and neck) is on your side with minimal padding/pillows
Or people who don‚Äôt get drunk easily
Natural selection for non-drinkers
You‚Äôll also choke and die if you‚Äôre drunk
... huh
Since you can also sleep on your stomach
Or maybe more
Plus fewer SIDS deaths
Back sleepers ftw
I'm also having a hard time imagining how you could sleep comfortably
But being the only one to have extra arms while useful would be kinda horrifying
I guess if everyone had 6 arms it'd be normal
A Machamp
I'm picturing like
*even sadder Greek mythology noises*
*Sad Durga noises*
yea, I feel like 6 - 8 would be max
I assume separate arms
well are they on separate arms or just two hands on the end of one arm?
If humans were born with four hands you‚Äôd still wish for more
also I also wish I had more arms and hands
uh human
Would it be weirdest to have a collection of human hands vs mannequin hands vs combo of both?
Random question bc Alan was complaining about not having enough hands
It smells like cookies on my floor for some reason
Guess we're doing an accidental full day fast lmao
My stupid ass hasnthad real food in like 10 hours
I'm sad our vending machines are apparently broken
Iconic
someone is playing "legends never die" in the shower here
you've become a child beacon
hahahaha
so many random high schoolers I kinda know came up to vancouver over break and it is very weird to see
Every Pringle‚Äôs can is a baby rocket
No
A topologist would probably agree
change my mind
rockets are fancy pringle cans
glad you have confidence in yourself
thanks math
Lmaoooooooi
I told Fran this already lmao but I VERY narrowly avoided a parking ticket @ UW just now
I'm about to leave
<@110137446053736448> where are you
Sapiens tells me girls get puberty earlier when there is more food
???
psych says that you can induce puberty in girls at an earlier age by stressing them out
Yeah I'm sitting in a bench
in other news
Litty tittu
fran's on his way tho
I'm gonna stay here lol
Is that a yes lmao
klsajdflkjaskldfj;lkasjfdkljasdlkfjlkasdjflkjsjadlkfjsalkdfjlksajjflksaj
<@110137446053736448> <@478706068223164416> hellooooo
Wanna meet me at my car at 5:40
<@110137446053736448> gonna leave in like 20-30 mins I think
Yeah lmao
Yes
Do you get the pineapple reference
Cuuuute
Three-man cuddle pile on the couch
Pineapple hahahahaha
Lmao
‚ÄúPineapple‚Äù
‚ÄúThis coat is so nice. It makes me harder‚Äù
‚ÄúThe two of us are the nice butt guys of first floor‚Äù
Iconic convo
Omg that reminds me of the time when I was cooking w Jarrett and Alan and some nearby gay guys were debating whether Bella fucked Edward in the tent in Twilight
Like what?
Their conversations are very interesting
Nice
I am in a common room with three men all of whom are gay
I love Genes collection of fluffy things
But it's fine
She‚Äôs already dead inside
The lighting was a yikes
What did you expect
I know
you're all washed out
your skin is also makes it look like you recently died
I'm like melting into ot
This beanbag is real nice ngl
Salina looks good tbf
Lmaooo
:(
about as good of an angle as Helen got of her TA
The least flattering angle ever but hello
Thats the most wholesome thing I‚Äôve heard on this server
i miss you guys
send  pics of you two
K I'm chilling in Gene's room now
~2 blocks from poplar lol sorry gimme a sec I'll walk over
We don't know where that is
That was some shit grammar
Wir wei√üen nicht wo ist das
Across from cafe solstice?
Uhh in front of the alley Korean restaurant
Where?
Wir gehen
Ja!
Also I parked on the ave
Are you asking if I'm down for pho? Bc yes
no me gusta esto
Sehr gut
where prairie dogs give no fucks
welcome to bio
Was?
so uh
<@503787499605458954> Wie ist Pho?
Wir brauchen  Deutsch sprechen
Kay be there in 10
Duck English
meet in front of Poplar?
Fock
Me and Alan's
You're only augmenting Alan and I's indecision
I'm down even if you want dining hall stuff
Idc
What're you feeling lol
The food place
Idk
Where to
oh he's here
As soon as he finds his way from THE FUCKING LAWN
Fran and I were about to get lunch if you wanna tag along
Haha 32
It's 55 and sunny here
Wack
It's been years since I've comehere during the day
It‚Äôs snowing here
Ok it's gorgeous today but this p much confirmed my prior that gas works is way prettier at night
But some ppl might be free
I have bio class like rn
Lmao
So I'm like 10 mins from campus lemme know when's a good time to pop over
Stopped to take pics at gas works
Good perspective
Lmao
This means theoretically I can get anyone I want because others wouldn‚Äôt
I am thrilled that my taste in men is so disagreeable
Also UW folks I'm about to start heading over again
I've found that I rarely share any of yalls tastes in men though so
I also don't think he's attractive but I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt
^
I shall speak for the masses and humbly request another
I would like to reassert that it was not a good photo
For the record I also disagree with your opinion on his hotness
Fair enough
No one has agreed with my opinion on my TA‚Äôs hotness
Accepting?
His current one
Which English teacher
Y'all roasted me for saying my English teacher is cute
Damn why are y'all so accepting
Lmao
Helen I‚Äôm sorry my bf is an ass
NOAH
Gross
"but you do ~~you~~ [him] helen haha"
Lol it‚Äôs not a great angle
but you do you helen haha
it's a weird contrast
but w hipster glasses
all i see is like grayson from shs
i don't find him that attractive sorry
oh
Got his side profile
bahahahahhaa
gimme a name
lmao
That‚Äôs even worse
do you have a name
That‚Äôs creepy
^
or it didn't happen?
pics
Literally 10/10 by almost anyone‚Äôs standards
ty ty v nice good to know
My stats TA is hot
üëå
Wait actually I likely have to be home kinda early tomorrow too I just remembered
Unsure we'll see what happens then
Oh wow
Maybe I'll bite, but I gotta be home by like 7 tomorrow, so I don't know if you'd wanna go back so soon. Least I'll probably get to see you tomorrow
<@110137446053736448> so I'm likely gonna be back tomorrow earlier in the day and can drive you home tomorrow if you'd like
I always strive to please
I appreciate your input :p
Very insightful
Lmao thanks Helen
Yes
Are y‚Äôall still alive
Alright I‚Äôm out
Ack the elm elevators smell like gym
Yeah okay I think I posted the safe card xD njoy yourselves
Idk lol
But either way important part is when you were planning to go back home
Don't worry I figured as much
Aw sorry I was driving :(
good call
Don't wanna be home at midnight
I get up at 6 tomorrow
rip fran
Nvm Cindy am on bus
if you guys are getting food later i'm down but like now's not  great time for me rip
~25 mins isn't a lot of time for dinner rip
i have frat stuff at 7
oh
would you be able to drive me back when you go back or are you planning to stay real late
if i were to stay to dine with yall
hey
UUH cindy
Yeah I'm good w anything and I don't wanna make y'all spend $$
she says she's not that hungry so I suggest Cultivate because it'd be funny
cindy's coming in a bit
<@&574247915518689281> where you guys wanna eat
Wack
yes easily
So you can touch the ceiling?
and they'd have no clearance
and people that are 6' 2" aren't exactly mutants
Salina would only have 3" of clearance
but I'm 5' 6"
the ceiling is only like 8 inches above my head
this just feels weird
Ohh this is an actual thing
vertical axis is demandingness
horizontal axis is sensitivity
I don‚Äôt get it
What I‚Äôm imagining
imagine four quadrants with axis of demandingness and responsiveness
it's more of a compass
One axis cannot create quadrants
the label for that quadrant is "disengaged"
In the middle?
that's on the axis
There are also parents who are neither demanding nor responsive
parenting styles can be plotted on an axis of demandingness and responsiveness
so it's topical
we're talking about infant development and attachment to caregivers
with blah blah exception this that
I mean it's true
Still can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs supposed to sound offensive
Lmao
I'm an asian dude listening to my psych professor trying to tiptoe around saying Asians have very strong familial values
uh
....
one of the following
> sock mommy that jarrett has personal experience with
> his dakimakura
> some anime character with a connection to socks
i'm confused too
..................
(Who are we talking about?)
Noncanonically she is 12
what is she noncanonically then
tf?
is that supposed to be *comforting*
who's 14?
...?
Okay so Canonically she's 14
j f c alan
............
<@!173668455856340994> would agree
sock mommy just sounds like a convoluted name for a cheap fleshlight
requires further contemplation
sock mommy have applications to the appeal of dakimakura?
in nursing we called it the sock mom
monkey baby love cloth mommy
I leave on Friday unfortunately
prob lol
I mean I'm free almost the whole day might hang around for a few hours?? Idk I'm gonna be in Seattle tomorrow and Thurs probably but I'm told tomorrow is probably best for y'all
wed only
everyday?
aka outside of my frat ~~indoctrination~~ lesson hours
try to come before 7 or after 8? you don't have to
oh cool
<@&574247915518689281> I'm gonna drop by UW tomorrow evening if y'all wanna do something or say hi but I don't wanna bother you if you're busy
Yeah that‚Äôs fair
Like color vs colour
It's not even that both are technically correct they're flat out both correct
Thank you for your input
I agree with Jarrett
Both are correct technically
That's just simplified
here's the proof i guess lol
yeah basically
that's why i wrote `doesn't look exactly the same, but v close`
psych?
and i'm in the middle of midterm studying too
i am a bad asian sorry
bc i have no chinese keyboard
i just used ctrl c ctr v
i know
I see literally no difference here
but they're basically the same
in chinese the dots under the left part is just a line
Á¥ô means paper
Á¥ô: (doesn't look exactly the same, but v close) zhi = paper
Êäò: zhe = fold
the words for origami tho do make a good amount of sense in terms of reading in chinese too
ÊâãË£èÂâ£ (shuriken)
ÂøçËÄÖ (ninja) for instance
this chapter of bocchi has a lot of Japanese words used in English a lot
i could be wrong tho
i feel like ppl assume that's the case already?
esp since origami has a strong link to JP culture, such as the 1000 cranes for a wish belief
but cool fact
tbh that's not surprising
or at least didn't realize that yes, indeed, it follows Japanese phonetic patterns, and is indeed a very japanese thing
cuz I for sure didn't
(it's Êäò„ÇäÁ¥ô, *origami*, for the curious)
me?
show of hands
who here knew that the word origami is actually of Japanese origin

this weather wack as fuck
also i got to leave work half an hour early cause of lightning lol
that according to my mom stopped very mysteriously right on the road right in front of my house
*snow*
i get on issaquah-pine lake rd
everything was clean on 228th
apparently the weather on the issaquah-sammamish border was wack
jkjk
water you talkin bout
Yo holy shit the water level in lake sammamish has risen so much
at least they're warm
Apparently lots of people are not having a good day
Ok we also just drove by a car that was on fire
(that means you guys can use it)
I anticipate ~2 more hours of work before the first live prototype goes online for closed alpha
the first Groupify playlist using the web interface has been made

True
and the only thing i could respond with is "that's fair"
starbot says, as he reads all of our conversations
mmhmm
I'm gonna have to tell my therapist about this
<@!470822754262712329> isn't that right you little cunt
more right than he currently talks
well
fax
If you're teaching him to "talk right" idk if this group is gonna be good source material
oh god
cool, just wanted to make sure before I downloaded literally every single message that has ever been sent here
sure
you guys are alright if I feed this server's chat history into a machine learning thingy to make Starbot learn how to talk right
hey just a quick question
Lol
won't miss it too much
they live nowhere near canada tho
Yikes
Oh
that would do it
ah
he tried to help his friend illegally immigrate there
ah
Tf did they do
How did they get banned from Canada??
i'm confused as to why you're confused
How
Why
Wait what
kkkk?
jjjj?
iiii?
hhhhh
i'm sorry
can't-ada
so does that mean that the country to him is
I have a friend whose father has been banned from entering Canada
Rip
rip
The people in front of us at the border just got taken into custody RIP
cowabunga my guy
Hey <@470822754262712329> , this is just gonna get worse from here, right ?
my nephew shat out a can of undigested alphabet soup that was more coherent than that sentence
<@!470822754262712329> have you considered finding people more like yourself
have you tried picking up a hobby? maybe talking to real people?
<@!470822754262712329> yes
<@470822754262712329> typical

but now Groupify Web's interface can successfully communicate with the Java service I programmed
in other news I spent an hour last night writing 20 lines of JavaScript
Sorry stats majors
I don't get hot over numbers in patterns
unless you just looooooove stats
I'm not convinced that a language developed with the primary goal of statistics is gonna become your favorite language
maybe i just don't know it well enough
They're more like math in disguise
me neither
I don't consider those real languages
Including Matlab
so the computational languages
maybe i just don't like data
specifically R
or Scratch?
Java, Python, R
by very high did you mean
I recently realized how much I dislike very high level programming languages
Wowzah
She's from Thailand, I had no idea
Yet another holy shit, small world moment
Also she's now coming home w me since she has relatives in Sammamish
Today I found out that one of my best friends here is Josh Banerjee's cousin
lmao
Last time I had the house to myself and it was amazing
Just that I have mixed feelings about going home in general mostly bc of my parents
I'm not saying I don't wanna hang out w you lol I def do
Yeah I'm down!!
Nick's in town too
At most I was gonna suggest brunch at Sam Cafe
lol I get it
No offense to y'all I do miss you guys but I kinda would rather stay here lmao
This was a very last-minute decision ~~mostly motivated by wanting to bring my snowboard back~~
I might spend most of Monday w my parents though idk
I know
three day weekend
we're "on break" too technically
I was supposed to travel
I'm on break
wanna hang out
heey
won't you miss school?
Update: I'm going home tomorrow for 3-4 days
Oh shit
Ok but I slept at 4
things are going pretty normal
8:20 here
6
I can do you one better, I‚Äôve been up since 8
Straight up not having a good time
I've been up since 8;30 T_T
and each part needs the previous one to be completed
which sucks because the researchers only have like a dozen participants including me
the system told me I had too many credits
and when I went to sign up for the next part
I did the first part of a three-week study earlier this week
I completed too many psych extra credit studies
I woke up earlier than my weekday alarm today -_-
Haha nice
I haven‚Äôt even gotten out of bed haha
was not fun
*physics*
*bliss*
realized my physics lab is at 11:30 and not 11
got ready
psych was pseudo-canceled today
going through my morning routine
Wow my room is a fucking trash pile
I have been released from the enslavement of my CS homework
YES I AM FREE
salty, savory
yummy yummy fries
mmm
Must resist
Currently REALLY craving fries
sure
Can this be a coed frat
- organized excursions to places around the world over breaks
I can't decide if I prefer formal or informal parties
Honestly Alan that sounds p lit
the recruiting table asks you to fold a shirt before signing up for the email list
So you have to screen recruits for life competency skills
taught by upperclass members
classes include cookery courses, sewing, taxes, folding clothes, planning a business trip, making a resume, etc.
- life skills classes offered in-house every wednesday evening
- uniform provided for special occasions
do i win
anyways back to frat planning
good luck now bitches
and failing
as well as me trying to change alan's nickname
political correctness
what caused this revelation?
stupid nerd --> very stupid nerd
okay alan
my tube
hey
hehehe
oh
rip
fine throw in Ngyuen then
wut
and singaporeans
that's OFFENSIVE' towards the koreans
but now that i think of it several of us don't use lowercase üò†
wait alan your nickname doesn't fit our lowercase conventions
<@!472541429130854421> ask if her last name's Li, Wang, or Chan
üôÉ
sorry, I forgot about u
<@!478706068223164416> *esque
fuck i have to figure out who my big is without her (?) telling me
- recruiting events are gatsby-eqse parties
and the hazing process can be cooking for older members
when you recruit you have to look for cooking and music talent then
lol
dancing performed by members?
live music performed by members
dinner cooked by members
that will get expensive fast
- occasional dinner nights with live music and dancing
- quiet hours from 10 to 6
i've already figured out my big is a female international student
- events include industry networking nights, etiquette lessons, and social skill crafting
yup yup
that's basically just installing a divider wall in normal dorm rooms
technically you could offer everyone their own room where each room can literally only fit a bed to maximize membership numbers while upholding your promise
sororities will love you though
hahaha you'll piss off all the other frats
- parties are formal wear
- shared common area equipped with sofas tvs and a fireplace
- all members get their own room
alan's frat/sorority
theorycrafting
no. stop.
owo my big just texted me
the thirst
wowzah
;)
Thanks for the imagery
The sheer confidence..... üòçüòç ~~I want her on top of me~~
Excellent way I never thought she was really my type but damnnn
Good way or bad way
Having now seen her live can confirm she has massive dick energy
Lol @ king princess for strap-on
Ok the first question is actually really difficult but I'd have to go Rihanna
I will accept Stupid Nerd
I have a suggestion...
Fran you have no nickname on the server
*Fran the Solar Powered Vibrator*
Y'all asked for it
Why not
Balance /Handcuffs
never say that again ty
.... uh
uh
I'm a SOLAR POWERED VIBRATOR
B/D
lmao
Uhh
so Fran what are you?
<@110137446053736448> is now though
<@173668455856340994> two of those people are born longer with us
you fuck off
jarrett fuck off
I‚Äôm shutting down my phone, see y‚Äôall on the other side
<@340319804747415553> <@478706068223164416> @gene:( @jane:(
Hmmm
Well I picked a different answer for each so results are inconclusive
yikes on a trikes
Well damn answer 3 of them
How would I know? I can‚Äôt answer three of the six questions.
What sex toy are you Helen?
welcome to the real world?
had a sex edition
UW newspaper
I don‚Äôt even want to know the context of this conversation
We very much mutually agreed that it would be weird to use them on other people
wait you're gonna throw them out rather than give them to her?
I should throw those out
Yeah
Ah
so I assume Cindy is out of luck with getting them  from you then
I appear to be handcuffs
Ahhhhh thanks UW newpaper
so it's not weird in that context
I mean she is a 23 - 26 year old Masters level chinese international student
It seems statistically improbable and yet here you are
Hahahaha
this feels wrong
my stats teacher is wearing a supreme sweatshirt
"the black hole is no brain where there should be brain"
do you want to live in fear
with a side of glutamate
large amygdala
can I get uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
small amygdala or big amygdala
<@!193229269076279298> I actually like that a lot better lmao
if it can't be easily read that's good
better
or is this better?
and i am in an SLG now which is basically a co-ed chill greek life
but i figure some sororities are more chill than others
better?
i'm not really into the whole hive mind thing
fight the power
i mean it by large groups of only females
who only have one gender*
this is unrelated but noah it bothers me that your nickname is capitalized when almost no one else's is please decapitalize it
friendships are with individuals
`I don't super value female-only friendships` this confuses me
but I don't want to pay membership dues (in the thousands) and I don't super value female-only friendships
the one my roommate got into (somehow without rushing) seems super nice
i'm sure there are some sororities i'd fit well in
But part of me just doesn‚Äôt care much for it
Tbh I feel like I could rush if I wanted
Also I would join a sorority but I‚Äôd need a new personality first
Hahahaha
That‚Äôs clearly Ekans in its natural human form
And all I see are the ekans eyes
Nice nice
Also she tried to draw me off of my fb pfp
Such a small world haha
My big is in the same sorority as Emi
So uh
Jesus
i will never write this much assembly again ever in my life
hit 500 lines of mips woohoo
that would make you a *user*
On one hand: coffee is literally a miracle drug I no longer have a headache
On the other hand: I'm vibrating w energy and cannot nap
seeing as she deals with a lot of people with posture problems
yea my mom loved the idea
I've been meaning to schedule some for when I'm back on certain weekends
Ok that's weird but kinda lit
A massage sounds amazing rn
This used to only be a problem when I played piano for too long
I'm always looking down, I miss not serious having back pain
The bigger comfort issue as far as work goes is that I feel like desks here are generally too low and when I have my laptop on my lap it's also too low for good posture
Again idk how I survived HS and ib üíÄ
When I did this a lot last year I would sometimes fall asleep in that position and wake up still w makeup and glasses and laptop on
That's not effective for typing but it works if I need to read things
I mean when I have really shitty posture I'll like lean back to almost lying down and put my laptop on my stomach lol
freudian slip
*RANTED
*ramted
unless you have a fuck ton of pillows to stack up
Or not lean against anything which is what I do
which are against a wall
just hold yourself up by the power of abs?
You can lean against pillows
<@!503787499605458954> how else would you sit in a bed?
you mean only next year you'll have desk space for your makeup, I thought you meant you'll only have desk space in general next year
I lean against the wall
oh
Because I‚Äôm switching dorms?
<@!472541429130854421> why will you only have desk space next year?
lmao
there is no way it's worse than sitting on your bed
i wanted to helen
I wanted to Helen about this like a day or two ago
This year I have a counter where I put my makeup but I‚Äôll only have desk space starting next year
That's why
Dude my desk chair is awful
My desk is more of a makeup/food space than a real work space
your back will hate you
yea cause you write essays on your bed, like a monster
60% of the time I'm in the library till it closes
I can't study effectively in my room
I‚Äôm frequently at my desk but often I have to study on west between classes
study, hw, CAD, project assembly, game, eat, etc
I do basically everything at my desk
i am a sedentary turtle who gives zero fucks
at my desk
i study...
..?
love my Material Science teacher
"I'm too short ...for this not in general"
This week I‚Äôve studied in my dorm, dorm common room, dorm conference room, in the east dining hall, in Vondy cafe, in the west union dining hall, first floor Perkins, fourth floor Perkins, outside my professors office, in the tech center in the basement of Perkins.
wait we have to study?
I plan on going to the cse2 building, and cafe happy sometime this week as well
this week I've studied at odegaard, suzzalo, the engineering library, the engineering academic center, my dorm, cafe on the ave, and the cse1 building
I switch between study spots every two hours
it's all of them
I found my favorite study spot
This is also the only reason I showed up to office hours
This is why you should always save things in the cloud
Usually this class has strict deadlines, but I‚Äôd saved my document to share point and I showed the professor my version history and was able to turn it in today for credit
I completely forgot to turn in a major assignment I‚Äôd finished a month ago
true
You can apply the same to Chinese tourists
lots of stories about how you can tell if tourists are american bc you can hear them across the street
personally, no, but compared to a lot of more soft-spoken countries, objectively yes
our loud and obnoxious ones are very loud and obnoxious
absolutely
yes
well
No
- psych textbook
"Do you think of Americans as loud and obnoxious?"
"90% of all data collected in human history has been collected in the last 2 years." <-fact that blew my mind today even though it really probably shouldn't have
I probably should
only been once and it was for a prof I was already on really good terms wth
haven't been either
Is it weird that I‚Äôve never been to an office hour
lol
this is why i wouldn't do well in compsci
this is what programming is
this feels irreponsible
that's someone else's job
not the entire empathy subsystem
I would program emotions
if I was told to program what "emotions" were for a robot
that's not my job
but
okay
but a robot doesn't know what empathy is either
to a robot
not empathy
we were asked to define emotion
psych: what is emotion?
alan: a way to help us empathize
me: what is empathy?
alan: DOESN'T MATTER
..... oh god
billet parts are very arousing
"Oh fuck Noah, that's so hot"
*Noah makes me help him steal scrap metal out of a dumpster*
"I prefer friends who are exciting and unpredictable"
it's ok, it's *Casually* Aroused
why do you always have the worst nicknames
babe why
Jarrett how does this make you feel?
lmao NOAH
and he fears it
or maybe he is aroused by it
hahaha
Jarrett is not aroused by the casual use of the word arousal
I do not like the casual use of the word arousal
(lenny)
I prefer a "very high level" of arousal

lol rip
i don't understand my own code anymore
things are getting bad
ohh
well I know I'm saying it doesn't make much of a difference if I'm doing that bc of work or not
that's a four hour difference
that's not "roughly the same time"
is standard
somewhere between 12-4 am
mood
tbh I sleep at roughly the same time whether I'm staying up to do work or just keeping myself up reading a book or fucking around online
the travesty
oh no
ugh i have to go downstairs
O_o
i stayed up intentionally to do work instead of sleeping whenever i wanted for the first time this semester yesterday
My main goal for today is to sleep at least 2 hours earlier
And same I literally worked almost nonstop yesterday except eating and when I crashed to nap
But damn
Lol probably
and they probably work
wrote about 100 lines of mips
i was extremely productive yesterday
thanks
i think i have many 2 hours of hw tops after class
i've been p productive today
And yeah good luck!!
gl on your interview tho
I was the most productive I've been in weeks yesterday
L
but i'm being very unproductive rn
i have an interview tonight and a lot of assignments due soon
Technically it was 8 hours ish?
I feel fine and have been up since 11
So it was aight
I also napped from 9-11
i've never needed to do either unless it was to catch a plane
jkjk
"before sunrise"
Yeah idk if that counts anymore but staying up till 5 and getting up at 5 are very different experiences
last "night"
ayy nice
I finally submitted my last applications last night / 5 am this morning
oh gl
I think I have a decent shot at getting it but idk how competitive it is really
Two I applied to start in July so that wouldn't be an issue but the one I want the most starts in June so I'm not sure if I'd be able to fit things into my schedule
Me taking summer classes is still slightly dependent on if I land a summer job
it would be fun if we could all be there at the same time
i might be able to visit vancouver too but it depends haha
oh cool
i may be able to come to vancouver for a weekend in late may/june
Also my exam schedule is out I will be home for a week or two late April/early May
Tbh same lmao
i'm so entertained that it's knife sets
"so, do you want a slice of our product"
"you could say we really have an *edge* in the market"
"the state of the art knife set really get the job done"
"do it from the comfort of your own home"
"well for the low price of 4 installments of $25"
"have you ever felt the need to stab your roommate"
"why hello tgere"
So apparently they've been sued for like predatory recruiting n shit
Technically it is a legit business but they target students and only pay based on demo appointments where you go meet people and. Show them knife sets, apparently
i was once messaged by some amazon representative on linkedin except it was super vague so i just ignored it
Anyways if you Google vector marketing the first things to pop up are videos of people saying it's a scam
I guess that's not hard info to find but man it was weird to have all of that autofilled
*they're watching you*
... L
Clicked the link and they already had my full name number email and knew that I was living on campus at ubc
Also I found it p creepy that they mentioned deca bc I didn't find any connection while googling and that makes it seem like they knew I was in it
lol
hm she didn't give her last name and didn't give the name of the company
So then they finally give the company name which. Is not a local business, it's a branch of cutco which is a huge american company that sells knives
you weren't kidding about the name
Yeah I just unblocked and reblocked lol
you just said, you wish you took screenshots before blocking them
You know what this would be easier to explain if I just get screenshots one sec
Anyways I was curious so I did text then back
I just checked w her she did no such thing
And it was like they recently joined and recommended that we reach out to you
First text was a little strange bc they had the full name of one of my good friends, and it's like a really hard name to spell so they either stalked her or actually know her
It got progressively creepier
what does being approached by an mlm entail
Ngl they're good I almost fell for it
I wish I took screencaps before I blocked the number
is that a scam or something
Basically a pyramid scheme
Multi-level marketing company
what is that
Y'all I just got approached by an MLM for the first time lmaooo
A couple hundred more to go
330 lines of MIPS
damn girl congrats!!!
good work
Woooo I got 72/75 on my first psych midterm
lol
do I not look like the type of person to steal stuff or something
I've been asked probably 8 or 9 times now
only like twice
I feel like I've been asked more than normal
how many times are you guys asked to watch other people's stuff at any random study place

litty titty
skiing then
would be longer for skiing though
lol
neither
which one won't you have a chance to do again?
should I:
-get up at 6 tomorrow to go to whistler even though I don't know anyone else who's going now that my roommate dipped
-spend a few hours downtown, probably cafe-hopping to study, w a friend
love that
brought to you by a chemistry demo video typo
*cumbustion*
O_o
but how he managed to get this far baffles me
to his credit he does say that he has ADD which is totally an excuse
how?
what the fuck?
3) it was during our normal class period
2) we have class literally every day at the same time
1) it's a midterm
there's a few problems with that
which
this one dude in my psych class discussion says he has such a bad time planning and remembering to do stuff that he forgot to show up to the midterm
conversation breaker

HOW HAS THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR FOR YOU GUYS

WHAT THE FUKC IS YOUR NICKNAME
IT'S THE 5TH WEEK OF WINTER QUARTER, AND WEDNESDAY TO BOOT
HEY GUYS IT'S THE HALFWAY POINT OF THE YEAR (FOR UW)
Damn
Big/little system prolly only lasts for one year
although it does feel a bit weird if it's permanent
well that is my guess then
They didn‚Äôt say they wouldn‚Äôt
do they have mixed gender?
I wondered what happened for my SLG to put this on the big/little sign up form...
I wonder how bad it is for everyone else around me when I take naps
Other people's alarms scare me so much
I‚Äôm really going back to east for an umbrella huh
AT LEAST IT'S NOT SNOWING
Fuck it‚Äôs raining outside and I don‚Äôt have an umbrella
hehe?
at least it's not snowing outside hehe

I feel like that‚Äôs a very INFJ response
**a s c e n d e d**
just a lil
he's just losing his marbles a lil
we're in psych rn
maybe
Have you been in psych
NOTHING IS REAL
YOUR MEMORIES ARE FAKE
school is cancelled for me tomorrow
idk it really grates on my nerves but maybe I'm just being harsh I also have friends who love her
she's always giving personal-life-examples of what we're talking about in class but to me it always comes across as "I think I'm better than my peers because I know sociology" i.e. "I refuse to donate to my kids' school because it's already well-off and doing so would contribute to social inequity"
I was complaining about how the prof comes off as so like pretentious and self-righteous and then a few days later people started coming back to me being like oh my god I totally see it and can't stop seeing it now
lol
*you will suffer with me*
I accidentally made some of my friends also hate soci
so I don't usually have my computer out then either
and it's more like "mildly discouraged" than "not allowed" in russian but it's better to handwrite notes for language
I'm pretty sure that's against student teacher relations
seriously, fuck my soci prof
what is this, high school
also really `I'm not allowed to use tech in some classes`
every Sunday I check all my class schedules and add everything for the next 1-2 weeks
I never actually put assignments onto my calendar in class
hmm
random personal to-dos and shopping lists and stuff go on my phone
so easier to get it on paper
I'm not allowed to use tech in some classes
that seems really annoying
yeah
you split it
really?
physical planner for assignments
digital calendar for events, meetings, big deadlines
I use google calendar/tasks
Salina uses a private discord server
how does everyone track their assignments?
we'll see
*he says that now*
and I think I'll still use it sparingly
so I made it this far without chegg
only learned about this last week
like all of my stuff is on chegg
yea
but @ stem kids
honestly this is pretty useless for me since like none of my classes have objective answers to anything
damn
basically this is a list of most of them
https://disboard.org/servers/tag/chegg
so I just made a folder of them and run down the list till I find one that works
but they also get remade quite often and there is a lot of them
not all of them work and they go down quite often
they generally have a 1-6hr cooldown, but you can just hop servers
so basically Mark showed me people have made discord bots that will go get chegg answers for you
that's what I was hoping to hear
lol I'm broke
anyone here use chegg?
"6000 is a very large number"

Good job guys
Hahahaha
probably the most awkward moment of 2020 for me so far
lmao
me without a shirt and her without pants
my roommate and I just walked into our bathroom at literally the same second at 2:43 am
I care
Incase anyone cared
I'm back tomorrow
Oh
Yikes good luck!!
*I think*
Bout an hour and a half out
How close are you to finishing?
Ah
Its very nice here actually with no people
At 1:30
And now I'm at the library
Nice
At the good hour of 6 pm I thought to myself "yeah I'll have this done in two hours"
Also note it's 43¬∞ and we still have snow
O_O
How
Wait I can help with that
I can start shitposting fanart
Lots of ways
How can this server become even weirder?

\~~ the end \~~
never again to enjoy the full extent of the world ever again
they simply found themselves entrapped, unable to escape it
for they did not choose the la croix lifestyle
instead look upon them with pity
do not turn away in disgust
when you look upon one drinking la croix
a ghost, or mere mockery of what could have been
uninspired
dull
a lifestyle devoid of genuine enjoyment of the human experience
it's a lifestyle
la croix isn't simply a drink
much like the drink itself
la croix is simply a reminder that they live shallow, unfulfilling lives yearning for the slightest hint of flavor and excitement in envy of what other people have
They drink hotdog water to get over their junk food addiction too
To get over soda addictions
why do people drink La Croix again?
L
Bright noisy water is just La Croix
also "bright noisy water"

Woah she looks really young
And her son pops in at the end of the mini lecture
Yeahhhh
I think that's great
our professor has her dog in her lap
on  of the recorded lectures to make up for the snow day
I'm a bad student so I didn't notice this until now but
that was fast
it is done
that paper isn't gonna write itself
üôÇ
get cracking
well
is actually due sunday noon
the 5 page paper that I thought was due at sunday midnight
so
hmm ]
gonna take that as a yes
idk, am I
idk, are you
I really am drunk huh
I had to read that like 5 times to notice the m
that's really toeing the lime there
thank you
in short I would like to move on and do better in the future
but I'd also like to apologize to myself for expending the energy to type it all out
I'd like to formally apologize for this wasting everyone's time with that joke
orange you glad that you realized
Holy fuck I'm stupid lmfao
that's what I forgot
or that
that your life is a lie?
I forgot ALL CITRUS FRUITS
Just realized

And eat an apple
Bruh just drink water then
I asked my dad why we're so obsessed with watermelons, and he said "it's hot, in temperatures like this eating watermelons is like drinking water"
I remember going to China and we would eat watermelons every single day
Watermelons are easy s tier for me
Although grapefruit has to be just right for it to be good
For me most citrus fruits go in S tier, I love oranges
Oh dear me and Jarrett have had discussions about fruits haha
for that reason, it sold only 10-15 million units, paling in comparison to its predecessor at 80-82 million, and well behind the original nintendo ds at 150 million
so the vita falls in this awkward spot between the audiences
if you wanted a portable device, you play on a DS which has the largest portable gaming library outside of smartphones
if you wanted good graphics, you play on your home console which produces much higher quality stuff than a handheld can
you see here's the problem
**GAMERS RISE UP**
but where's the market for gamers who care about that kind of stuff?
it touted itself as the first 720p graphics portable console, capable of playing many games in high fedelity
who was it meant for?
the vita had a very obvious problem
the vita was the super under appreciated successor

I love salmon
maybe, I eat it anyway
idk
I'm so sorry
You're allergic to salmon??
Noah
banana huh
I know I definitely do
Yes
Apple's minus gala
everyone can appreciate a good banana
O wait
Bananas are the most inoffensive fruit
So looking at all of these

S: Mango, Lychee, Durian (for its street cred), Strawberry, Asian Pear, Tangerine 
A: Banana, Orange, Grape, Watermelon (in the summer), Blackberry 
B: Coconut, Blueberry, Cherry

D is not hate-tier for me. It‚Äôs the meh tier
S: Bananas, apples, nectarines
A: strawberries, peaches, blueberries, grapes
B: Pears, cantaloupe, oranges, plums
C: Raspberries, blackberries, pineapple, kiwis
D: Dragonfruit, Mangoes, Papaya, Honeydew, Pomegranate, grapefruit, watermelon

i think i'm allergic to the burn in hell tier
A: watermelon , orange

Helen is really hating on some classic fruits

D: dragonfruit, durian
the human experience in a nutshell
> bored and hungry
idk why I thought having 5 class hours back-to-back was ever a good idea
I'm so bored and so hungry!!!
and yet chose to write an IA on it
side note that I hate those kinds of problems
lol
that is THE FANCIEST "R" I have ever seen
side note
rip
and guess who has a pollen allergy
I googled "jackfruit allergy" and found out that people with pollen allergy are more likely to be allergic to jackfruit
last time I ate it I put two and two together
and I had always had an unexplainable stomach ache after eating it
I had been eating it at parties and stuff throughout my childhood
how did you find out
yeah
really? lol
jackfruit is in the right place because I'm allergic to it and it's the only food I'm allergic to
durian should be S tier just because of its presence
btw I'm aware this list is heavily weighted at the top and that's kinda not supposed to be the case but I don't care I LIKE FRUIT OK
plums?
cherries are s-tier
oh fuck!!!!
cherries?
I feel like I'm forgetting something common and important
s-tier: MANGOES, lychees, dragonfruit, green grapes, strawberries, blueberries, coconut, cherries, white peaches
a-tier: raspberries, blackberries (off the bush), pineapples, guava, banana (reluctantly), asian pears, pluots
b-tier: apples, regular pears, watermelon, cantaloupe, papaya, plums, apricots
c-tier: blackberries (store-bought), honeydew, red grapes, yellow peaches
d-tier: durian, jackfruit (the only fruits I actively dislike. stinky.)
The flavor is just so exquisite that no one can replicate it
Like licking asphalt right after it‚Äôs been lain down
artificial flavouring doesn't count smh
Mango is S tier to me
Artificial mango flavoring tastes like tar to me
I vote mango A tier
Oh dear
*jarrett*
I just couldn't handle the distinct lack of taste that suddenly overtook the conversation
you're welcome
thank you
mango S tier fruit
ok I'm actually gonna do a fruit tier list hang on
how dare you Jarrett
Ooooh slimy
D tier fruit
mangos are slimy
mangoes are a top tier fruit
The taste of apple juice is always acceptable to me though it‚Äôs mostly sugar water lol
Agree about watermelon, idk what guava juice tastes like
I like mango nectar the most
Coconut water is ok and the only reason I drank it was because it‚Äôs less calories than other juices when they‚Äôre all free
guava and watermelon are also top tier
I think coconut water is my favorite "juice"
I like orange juice as much as any other juice
unless like combined w alcohol
also I'm not a fan of orange juice
yes my big gripe w em is that they're messy
Oranges are fine but less convenient
I like clementines/mandarins/tangerines, whatever the evolutionary hierarchy these fall into
I'm really bored should I do a fruit ranking
honestly not a huge fan
"how many of you like eating oranges?"
huh
yikes

I find questions 1 and 3 more interesting but 2 is one I don't actually know much about going in
i feel like you would like 3 the best
i vote 2
which prompt should I do?
1. Did the outcome of World War I make fascism inevitable? Why or why not?
2. Where did Japan ‚Äúgo wrong‚Äù and slip into radical nationalism during the 1930s? 
3. Did the fall of the Soviet Union fundamentally change the nature of Russian politics?

hey i'm here if u wanna test that
I wonder if I can use inattentional blindness in Smash
but no we're too busy arguing with each other to do more than one thing at a time
we'd get so much more done if we could just **do things concurrently**
the other does physics
one does math homework
I want two brains
You can have half a brain with nearly full functionality but unfortunately the other half will rot
If you excise half your brain the other half will learn to take over the tasks
effectively doubling my brain's output capacity
I wonder if I can retrain my left brain to do right brain work and my right brain to do left brain work
This is why bio class has the shame rows
I'm the guy
that's me
the guy in front of me in history is browsing reddit and the memes are honestly really distracting lmao
day offffff
hellooooo
every few hours I remember that y'all have today off and am mildly bitter
fuck off you icon whore
why do I need 5
you only need one icon
fuck Solidworks
because i'm still a freshman and i feel like i just got on campus, and these little upstarts and trying to boot us out
Why?
i feel existentially threatened by them
there are a ton of 2024 kids ("pfrosh") on campus today
so we know who it is now
literally the top thing was an "Access Center" form asking for an assignment extension
so I ask our RA if I could open but the bag and see if anything identifying was in it
someone was leaving their trash bags around the dorm floor next to other trashcans because they were too lazy to take it out themselves
Four day weekend hell yeah

honestly i would vote noah and jarrett
*which two*
question is
for some reason this seems like a very realistic situation for two of us to find ourselves in
your parents were actually predicting the future
it was all planned from the beginning
shit
it's funnier when you realize my sister's name is also helen
real subtle
I wonder what it could beeeeeeeee
"hel" and "cin" have a certain compliment to each other and I just can't put my finger on it
but also it goes really well together
I admit even "cin" and "hel" is stretching the bounds of laziness
jkjk
lol "alan" is as short as my name reasonably gets
tea
better suggestion
I'm stupid
ah
wen
ala? 'lan???
also since you've taken to calling me and helen cin and hel I feel compelled to give you a 3-letter nickname even though your name is already really short
you never know
one day it might actually be me
lmfao
every time the name is mentioned I look up in surprise
also one of my prof's names is Alan
it's literally all I've thought about today lmao
we're also talking about racism, prejudice, stereotypes and the development of a racialized worldview in sociology and geography
thank you for the nazi procreation fact of the day
splendid
not-very-fun fact of the day: Nazis targeted German gays because they were refusing to procreate/contribute to the ideal Aryan race, but they didn't care if you were lesbian because according to their ideology, women could be forced/coerced
cheers
cheers
this next cup goes out to you cin
sadly
I can't skip anything today

good choice

it's too damn early to be talking about the holocaust at least lemme get a coffee first
welcome to your brain
lmao
it doesn't sound bad until you remember I live 4 minutes away
I came in like 2 or 3 minutes late
lol I didn't even make it to psych on time today
I'm actually amazed I made it on time
it took SO MUCH willpower to get out of bed at 9:30
7 am isn't *that* earl
10 am isn't *that* early
I'm so tired
I wish
nope
so no lol
I have a 10 am today
was it your choice?
you're up early
hi cin
you're not wrong
it's trying its best
stop shaming your brain
tell me I'm fucking wrong
u need god
the midbrain looks like a ballsack and you can't tell me otherwise
Lol
regular ppl: time to relax
me, an intellectual in psych class: time to rest and digest
I mean technically don't you replace every cell in your body every ~7 years
catch me in 2222 on my fourth life
just grow me a new body in 2080 and I'll go back to being 20 again
stem cell + neurogenesis
And then when you get really old and start shrinking that‚Äôs when you know you‚Äôve really stopped growing lol
When you stop growing taller as an adult, you‚Äôre actually still growing a tiny bit but gravity counteracts it
I think it‚Äôs not that surprising
**THAT'S SO COOL**
*ahem*
`Until about 30 years ago, scientists believed that adult brains produced no new brain cells. There is now evidence that new neurons are produced in some brain regions (Eriksson et al., 1998; Fris√©n, 2016). The production of new neurons is called neurogenesis.`
psych notes
i think so
Yeah
is this for rushing?
hahhaha
What a mood
We had a delay, which was p nice cuz I can wake up now instead of 7:30
But it's p short
I have another one due Fri
KNEW IT
hahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaa
You're not wrong
:(
bc statistically it seems like you always have at least one hahaha
i suggest writing whatev papers you have due :p
Honestly yeah

looking around ~1/3 - 1/4 of the people seem to have macs

so our program design class requires that all mac users dual boot windows (or virtual machine) to submit assignments

I took an hour-long nap after coming back from the gym
as a direct result of this environmental stimulus
my psych class was canceled
It's like slightly colder and drier and that's about it
Our climate is pretty similar to Seattle
But we have snow plows on campus so there's no real excuse
it's canada
really?
Snow is pretty unusual here
Lol
snow is just part of the package
no classes canceled either though

Good job Alan
I am in full support of this
Crush their souls
alexa play bring me to life
you killed him inside
oh man
I don't even know his name
random ass asian dude comes to his casual smash party and wrecks everything
poor dude
(I can tell in part by how he controls his character, in part because of Body Language)
as the night went on the owner of the switch got more and more dejected as he played
I'm proud
Solid
one game I took 8/9 stocks from my opponents
the rest of the night went as you'd expect
FIGHT TO THE END
***pathetic***
Lack of spirit
Booooo
that's the first time I've ever played someone who literally gave up before the first match was over
he said "yeah I wasn't gonna win that"
Lol
I ask him "what's wrong?"
and kills himself
then he holds his stick towards the blastzone
I do a pretty standard Link 0 to 46 damage combo on him
and then on his second stock
I take his first stock because he's throwing out smash attacks that only hit casual players
we both had two stocks left
Knock em dead king
(it was a free-for-all)
at the end of the first game it was down to me and the owner of the console
It makes no difference to me imma suck either way
"that was pretty good"
More like only people who are actually good bother to use pro controllers
"WOW"
"oh wow"
(in game) "oof"
(setting up controls) "oh wow you use tilt stick? I use tilt stick too!"
"you know what they say about people with pro controllers, it's the only thing that makes them good"
"oh wow he's got a pro controller"
from here on out I will exclusively use quotes said during the time
I said sure, washed my dishes, and got my controller
our RA knows that I play smash and am an "elite smasher", so he invites me to play some smash
like 5 people and our RA were in the lounge playing on the Switch when I walked in with some dishes I was gonna wash
my floor was holding a game night
lol okay
Yes
oh you wanna hear about me playing smash tonight?
Due
And the papers not die till Saturday
But I kinda just wanna sleep
that's the problem we're trying to sovle
I mean I'm like coherent
haha i was right alan
by page 7 you should have a masterpiece
Alan what the fuck lmao
~~something about a paper~~
drink for every page you complete
O don't have class till the afternoon tomorrow

Shhh
~~#excuses~~
mmmmh
Also yes I know it's 9 pm on a Wednesday but I was catching up w a friend who took a gap semester
Alan what would you say
Huh
sorry sorry i'll go back to hw
drink more?

omg do i try to torture kids next year
hahaha i can be a fig leader next year
keyword being **induction**
an induction hotplate doesn't count as an "open coil appliance"
technically I'm still within the rules
I'm guessing we're in the clear
so if 24 hours pass and nothing comes of it
nobody's came and talked to me yet
Was it you
So
I had never been so relieved to see him in my entire life
it was Fran
and soon enough, a knock did sound
waiting for a knock on my door
quitely
I sat there
so as I went back up the stairs into my room
the thought that it might've been my fault lingered in my head
(it was five minutes)
and waited in the rain for what seemed like an eternity
but as I went down the steps out of the building
I posed an argument: It wasn't me because I've made a lot more steam/smoke in this room before and that hadn't set off the alarm
I thought about it for a good few moments as the alarm rang throughout the building
was it me who set it off?
I considered for a brief moment
roughly 15 minutes after I sent that snap, as I was making my last pancake, **the fire alarm in my dorm went off**
but this time on a hot plate in my own room
if you saw my snap story earlier today I was making breakfast as usual
and non-binary ladsies

I‚Äôm not even back yet and I‚Äôm exhausted

some teachers like to make the final impossible to really test what you actually understand, then just curve the hell out of it
were you supposed to be able to finish the final?
LET'S GO MILKSHAKES
FUCK MATH
YAAAAAY SELF PITY
who knows maybe other people did just as bad
yikes
I don‚Äôt care about the grade that much but for context, out of 15 problems I could finish 4 with little confidence they were 100% correct, and I had to leave 6 completely blank
and if it was you can bounce back, I believe
i'm sure it wasn't that bad
awww
Having a self pity milkshake
Just took the biggest L of my life on the math final
This isn't meant for us to plan. We have our own server for that so we don't bother everyone. This is meant to be for academics.
also, i feel like we should split this channel into two -- one for people at UW to plan get togethers and stuff, and one where we talk about academics related things
This is the stupidest math question I‚Äôve ever seen
nice job!! proud of you
congrats, cindy!!
I survived though!!;!
Bro the hand cramps are so bad rn
I also can't get coffee bc I need to sleep early tn
I don't trust myself
sounds like dangerous 10 minute nap itme
then I have 1 essay to submit and then I'm done
1 hour to my last final
I'm so sleepythis is really not good
Everything else is inferior
Thin ankle shocks are the only socks worth having
These look like my grandpas socks
No
I just wanted one that was higher than ankle socks
The ones I got aren‚Äôt thick
I never wear them regularly though they're too thick
hey same!
I use them all the time for hiking
costco wool socks are bomb
They‚Äôre alright
I just got a pack of wool socks (men‚Äôs lol) from Costco
Nice!
I got a heattech tee and socks for ten bucks
from the uniqlo sale
Free socks?
HELL YES
MY FREE SOCKS ARRIVED
Why did you leave it?
Stayed in the engineering school?
oh rip
I had a nice stack of AP credits such that I could graduate a year early from UW, or I could have used them at duke if I stayed in the engineering school
wdym?
See I had that option but I forwent it twice
It's just so expensive to pay for 4 full years in the US
I really think everyone should go into college with as much credit already earned as you can
Yea
and like, for example, I never considered ED bc technically my parents can afford it but if I got in to like columbia or penn or smth it'd cripple their savings
people who need FA are usually told to apply regular
like you have to make a case for yourself, when you apply ED it's not legally binding but you your parents and counselor all have to like sign shit saying you'll go
Even state university is like 30k
most schools require you to talk to financial advisors / the FA dept
Half that is basically my max
Yet here we are
I don‚Äôt think most people should be comfortable with spending 60k+ per year on university
Different people have different comfort levels with how much they are willing to spend on college
So just apply to what you‚Äôre actually interested in
Whatever the case it‚Äôs difficult and unpredictable
What is considered too much money varies by person
Not necessarily
yeah but you have to prove it
Which seems to be the main way people back out
^
That depends on your actual finances
Also you can always just claim too much financial burden
Super serious to someone actually trying to get into college
I wouldn't say that's super serious consequences
My friend group is inducting a new member and this is the message they sent her today
fine, *it's incredibly hard to get out of without serious consequences
The drawback mostly comes from colleges talking to other colleges about you backing out
Just double checked, it's not legally binding as I thought
My personality definitely changed because of the class culture
Maybe it‚Äôs because a class sticks together and cultures for like 12 years and individual personalities are influenced by it
like I think parents and competition are getting worse each year but it shouldn't produce that significant of a result
it's only 1 year
anyways I don't think the class personality difference is a generational thing, it's prob just a coincidence
it is, it's incredibly hard to get out of
"binding"
Because ED is binding, they‚Äôre not decreasing acceptances due to predicting more people will accept the offer
That means they‚Äôre accepting less people in general, that makes no sense
maybe it's just duke that had a significant drop idk
yeah
For ED applications?
That makes no sense
even if there were less applicants
I read yesterday that the overall acceptance rates hit an all-time low though
If this trend continues we might have just been born into the worst year lmao
No idea
huh interesting, why?
I commented on the partying mainly bc I didn't know anyone in our ib class who did hard drugs, while I know/know of several in the 2020 class
Also the number of people who applied to duke ED dropped by 500+
Still it‚Äôs weird there are distinct personality differences between two consecutive years
true
Though I think that‚Äôs also because IB students bond in a larger group than on level kids
not that they party the most but that they party the most enthusiastically
We definitely saw that with IB students at school dances lmao
Maybe the most stressed people party the most
So it‚Äôs a low bar I guess
Well I don‚Äôt think our class partied that hard
yeah lol
I didn‚Äôt know that lmao
Seriously?
it's strange
2020 class also parties harder than we did though
I feel like our grade was a lot of kids who were taught the values of hard work but mainly love fun
But we‚Äôre only apart by one year
Is this a generational trend?
One of my friends from another high school agrees
Yeah idk why
I feel like the current senior class is a lot more snakey and competitive than ours was in general tbh
Her sister Maya is here too though we never talked or saw each other
Anyway I‚Äôll try to get to know Heera more when she gets here next year
They are all people who are nice by first impression tho
She‚Äôs my friend but I‚Äôve noticed many of her friends (and herself to a lesser extent) are very snakey/manipulative
what's wrong w julia
I want to think she‚Äôs a nice person tho
She is Julia‚Äôs friend so that gives me a distinct first impression
Heera is p good
I have a neutral opinion of her I guess
Heera got into Duke and idk how to feel about that yet
Interesting
Just stating he will have an opinion
Is that asking me to share or is it just stating that he would care
<@503787499605458954> Gabe is very good friends with Quennie, so he would have a opinion on your thoughts
Just Friday the Thirteenth things
Sorry Alan I killed everyone
I'm still here, but I'm doing things today and going back tonight

At home sorry

G'night
thanks b night
S L E E P
I need to be up by like 10 or 11 lol
G'night and good luck, Cindy!!
Alright
At least go in with some rest
am also gonna go to bed
but yeah I
dont think it'll be too bad
whatever I think I'm just going in blind
Hopefully the exam goes decently at least?
Idk what to say
That sounds kinda useless
Uhhh rip
not what he's giving us
which is
one of them is literally about take-home essay exams
this is stupid
I just checked canvas
my history prof posted the most useless exam prep help ever smh
So excited lmao
Thanks!!
yeah you too w post-exam celebrations lol
Def have fun with that!!!
Aww that's actually kinda wholesome
I was a little annoyed at how early my dad wants to pick me up on saturday but then I found out it's bc he wants to go get dumplings and hang out more in van before we head home and now I'm totally game lol
nice nice
I'm currently in celebration mode and will be back in Sammamish on Saturday
Thanks!!
yooooo congrats!
I'm finally done with finals though!
I'm gonna sleep soonish though
Totally don't have morning plans tomorrow lol
Boolin'
Uh just ya know
so why are you up at 4 am?
oh like idc if you're interested I'm def not above gossip I just don't think it'd be great to put it all into the big server
I won't pry.
I respect that decision. That's p mature.
I feel like I should stop talking shit, I'm not like trying to make y'all hate her, if you want details dm me or something. I also feel like I shouldn't care since we're all already in school lmao. I don't doubt that she's a great student but personality wise, yikes man
nvm
actually
there was this whole thing
I can see why that'd be really upsetting, especially with the cheating thing you mentioned
like I'm trying to hold back my own bitchiness but it kinda genuinely upsets me that she's one of the handful of skyline people to get in when so many (more deserving) others didn't
Doesn't quite ring a bell, but fair enough
but is p skinny/small? idk
she's really pretty actually
I don't even know what this person looks like
Oh boi
I have a pretty absurd amount of tea on Quennie
Rip Logan though. I know he really wanted Stanford.
I don't recognize the other people, although I've heard Quennie's name floated around a bit because Logan Knapp was complaining to me when they were sophomores about doing a project with her
It kinda is
aw that's oddly wholesome
We used to sit next to each other and complain about literally everything lol
yeah lena taught her bassoon for a while lmao
She used to be in band
Heera!! Omg!
Double duke kids is a lotta tuition
Damn
heera got into duke <@!472541429130854421>
Wow Stanford kiddos
amanda's the one who got recruited for gymnastics I think?
idk emily but good for her
Violin master
Emily wow
I've heard Many stories from people in that class
the couple of times I've interacted w her she was really rude, thought she was better than everyone
oh she's really bitchy and cheats hella lmao
Why?
Quennie? really? yikes
Amanda Zhang, Emily Park, Quennie Nguwen
whomst?
Just chatting with him now
Yea
what?!?!
Gabe says three of his classmates got into Stanford
oops
assumed that a dude I cited in an essay was a girl
I
oh fuck lmao
Haven't heard anything from Gabe about the goings on
I also don't care that much anymore... lmao
So no
Most of my friends aren't too ambitious tbh
Anyone heard any ED results from current seniors?
Also my intern friend got into Columbia!
I decided tech schools weren‚Äôt for me
hm interesting what did you change partway through the process?
And got deferred by MIT and Georgia tech and realized ‚Äúfuck my strategy is wrong‚Äù
Hey I got rejected by cal tech around this time last year
I‚Äôm pretty sure tomorrow is also ED release date for a lot of universities
üò¢
Good
We all gonna die before we know it
Wack
Looking for a Job
In University
It‚Äôs still weird to think that we‚Äôre Adults
I went back to the Senior destinations Facebook page to look at our grad caps
Isn‚Äôt that crazy?
Tomorrow marks six months since we graduated
That‚Äôs not currently a problem but it has been in the past
Correction: I love having no work to do, but I hate it when I coincidentally also have no hobbies I want to do
Can't relate on that front
If you have nothing to do either revel in the lack of responsibility or find something to do
Very relatable
So we hate it when we have stuff to do and when we have nothing to do
I hate it
I have nothing to do still
I wanna die
I have another essay due tonight
I just did my first one today
hang in there
rip
I could use a drink
Last final is done
I feel less bad about Russian than I expected

I‚Äôm not very talented in the things they actually care about so maybe at least I‚Äôm talented at being Asian
Yeah like every club is competitive here
I find that very weird
<@!193229269076279298> to provide the answers you so desperately desire, a selective living group (SLG) is an alternative option to Greek Life. They‚Äôre communities that choose people based on a common interest, like a hobby or future profession. Fusion is technically called an ‚ÄúAsian cultural interest‚Äù SLG but it really just means Asians
this is accurate
you know
*please don't take me seriously*
because it seems like you've got that to mosey around with your chronic condition of being a pain in the ass
Hey join the club
you must be part of the population that has more than one chronic condition
a chronic illness
g d i
it's a permanent condition
no can do
also cindy get yo mind outta the GUTTER

it's 3 am on the east coast
<@472541429130854421> come answer the question
I'm just lost on the whole ethanol part
I know what the joke is
also idk what asian selective living is either
maybe I'm just a perv and made it way worse in my head
does that clear things up
Salina: `you'd know about me being a dream huh`
Salina: `do they smell like ethanol and rapidly evaporating dreams`
Jarrett: `Why yes they do smell like you, why do you ask?`
What is this?
`Asian selective living group`
But also, someone answer the damn question
I'm lost, kinda
why did you make me think about that!!!!!
BRO I do not wanna think about that
lmao jarrett
you'd know about me being a dream huh
one had a refreshing lavender scent
some smell metallic, others earthy
Why yes they do smell like you, why do you ask?
sorry sorry bad joke
do they smell like ethanol and rapidly evaporating dreams
<@173668455856340994> is in
ahh
<@173668455856340994> and I crunched math for 3 and a half hours on a whiteboard and now I can smell derivatives

well have fun
I‚Äôm going to rush for Fusion, an Asian selective living group (SLG), and practice to audition for Temptasians (an a cappella group), and rush for Catalyst, the competitive tech social networking group

Late March? Idk
When is spring break for UW ppl?
It's what it's
Eh
I try
it has never been applied correctly
this is like the like at least fourth time i've heard you say something along those lines in the past week
no

no. stop.
I'm trying to find an uwu or owo somewhere in there lmao
stop
but like, most of those are only affordable for those in-state, and compete with prestigious private schools for students
there are good and comparable large state schools in the US - see: UW, the UCs, UMich, etc etc
`Why should we believe that faculty teaching ‚Äú5 to 10 times more students‚Äù will produce the same quality of education? (Sincere question: I‚Äôm not sure of the answer here.)` also, this is the first comment, which is valid at first glance, but honestly, my class sizes are consistently smaller than all of yours, from what I've heard. my biggest class is still less than 100 people, versus Helen's 400+ person CS lecture
I would assume buildings work under the same idea as professors, majors go through a boom and bust cycle so you need to have lots of professors for ever topic regardless of its current popularity, just in case it become popular
You guys have a lot more horizontal land space though
I mean WSU is 22,500 students, and much of the place is still empty
That‚Äôs kind of insane
My friend group alone accounts for 1% of the freshman population
About the small school size thing
Wait holy shit

never talked to him again after 5th grade though
yeah I remember him being super nice too
we used to be friends in like first grade or something
he lives (lived?) on my street
m a r c u s  c h i n
oh the other person I was thinking of from my 3rd grade class was marcus chin
dw
lmao
sorry
loool
yeah, no, that just sounds kinda bad
but i don't know if that does
if it helps, i don't really remember the emo part
nah it's good I just think it's kinda funny now I guess
awww, i'm sorry
first I was an asshole then I was just emo
my elementary school social life was a spinning wheel of kids who kept moving out and then the awkward asian squad
idk why he tolerated me tbh
that's really wholesome
but anyways yeah we were p tight from ages like. 8 to 10. idk what happened to him though i don't think he went to plms
G O T T A  C A T C H  E M  A L L ,  B I T C H E S
gotta catch em all
oh hey I didn't even realize that wording
awww that's wholesome
he was the only person who noticed and he just lowkey helped me collect em all
was dropping a bunch of pokemon cards under a desk in the middle of class in 3rd grade
i wouldn't know lol
one of my clearest and randomest elementary school memories
was he?
he was suuuuuper nice
can't even put a face to him
that's it
he had curly hair
his family owned a farm or something based on something someone told me
i vaguely recall him
omg
i remember him
but I don't remember what his real name was
I feel like that was his middle name and he just went by it, and his real name was a lot less interesting
no
does anyone else remember this kid Finley from Discovery?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj46BWpxFcA
reminds me of this moment
plus no one walks up to a drunk stranger and asks "are you that rando from 10 years ago"?
the "be careful who you call ugly in middle school" joke is a joke for a reason. people change hella too
granted, i'm sure i'd recognize them if you told me who they were, but if i hadn't seen them in 10 years, good god
I remember 2
i remember very few
i remember a lot of them ngl
do you remember everyone from your 3rd grade class?
humans are very good at recognizing people
you'd be surprised
and it's also been like a decade
idk about you, but i look p different from when i was in elementary school
why?
i doubt they'd recognize you though
cause they knew who you were, but now all the know about current you is that one time you ran into them
it's like it would be weird to see one of your old elementary school teacher if you were walking home drunk from a party
pretty common thing
I'm not sure why I was so self conscious in hindsight
She was walking home talking to a friend on the phone and I was in full Extra thot mode heading to a party. It was like the strangest of role reversals
Idk it was a weird context
<@!503787499605458954> why tho?
ok
uh
Ok I feel like I'm gonna leave in like an hour I'm so tired
I'm not drunk I swear lmao
ESCAPE
Sscape
I've made my edcapey
Just ran into Michelle Lee hoping she doesn't recognize me!!!aaaa
lmao idk
Cause they just sent me an email yesterday that went something along the lines of "Hey idiot, your vaccine verification isn't the official version"
Anyone know when this goes into place?
O nice

and a lot of people actually did write their long essays on it so I kinda doubt he'll ask
but again I've been following it super closely already
it is one of the Big International Current Events
I would love to write a paper on that
obvious thing that's been in the news lately is Hong Kong
the study of doing stuff with computers
comp sci
huh
/end mild rant
technically political science is the study of power relations. though the field doesn't really have a solid definition, and it's usually simplified to the study of governance/the state (even though some of the most important political powers, especially nowadays, are non-state actors. smh)
btw literally almost anything that happens in this world can be analyzed in political terms
my formerly very conservative opinion on it is one of the first things that flipped when I started getting into politics
affirmative action has a weird place in my head
the suggestion is appreciated though
to be clear I'm not picking the topic I'm looking into things idk about that might potentially come up. a) I know A Lot about that already and b) it's not something that's really been in the news lately
not sure how polisci works into that but <@503787499605458954> thats a topic
there was a small quote on how it's systemically trying to keep Asian people from breaking into the upper class by keeping a limited number of them from entering elite universities
I'm late but my second major paper that I'm bs'ing rn is on Affirmative Action and how it hurts Asians
np
thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è
there's new proposals on reforming how healthcare pros are going to be regulated
also a UN Indigenous rights bill approved unanimously in BC, which i think was the 1st UN resolution to be enacted in legis in NAmer i think
there was a CN rail strike that ended up impacting agri that was recently ended
oh hey something i kinda recognize
i could see the transpod hyperloop proposal to the gov being fair game
the latest one i think (quaternary?)
and 5/6 of the extinct ones are all dead in one extinction event
granted there's 6 extinct species, but 2 are still living their best lives
yes bison still exist
why does this feel like a "if she's from africa why isn't she black" mean girls moment
`I'm dumb`
oh my goodness
cindy...
bison still exist?
i.e. bison
the park renewal project thing is like introducing new species back into certain heritage parks
lol
I'm dumb
I've literally been to events related to that
it's relatively new, started in 2013
wait I should've known that
oooooh
orange shirt day is an awareness day for the indian residential school system
lmao oops
yes these are canada things
are these canada things? if these are canada things you officially know more than me
park renewal projects?
the gov slashing ontario music fund by ~1/2?
orange shirt day?
it's bc no one cares about canada but canadians have a surprisingly big impact on parts of pop culture
it's so weirdly general and obscure at the same time
i just find it funny that canada has its own category for it lmao
yeah i know
I mean, not impossible, but probably improbable
#justiceforkeanu
loool
lmao
if he pulls out brook lynn hytes winning PCA for most hypeworthy canadian i'd die
honestly
anything that's happened or is currently ongoing from the past 3 months is fair game
ah that's fun
he says he reserves the right to throw a curveball, one of the past ones was the red starbucks cup
but that's a lot less specific
oh i was thinking of like tokenism/representation in media
but as an example of a cultural thing
I think I have a good grasp on what potential topics are for like overtly political current events i.e. impeachment, western separatism (canada), etc
hm i see
ok so how our essay exam works is he just throws out a current issue and tells you to write an essay analyzing it w polisci terms
like cultural in what way
what are some big ongoing cultural issues
anyone wanna help me brainstorm possible poli essay topics?
your future career doesn't really hinge on an extensive math bg imo
i would say no personally but up to you
do whatever makes you happy
Should I say fuck it all and get a double major in math
***why are we here, just to suffer?***
I've never made an error
I looked
prof said go find an error you made in your previous works cited and fix one to leave
I think it screams "I don't wanna write this"
```
May 3rd, 2019. University of Washington campus. The University of Washington College Republicans, an activist group based on the Seattle campus, is hosting a bake sale. For the most part, the bake sale did not look like anything out of the ordinary. 

At the table a few students sat, selling Costco cookies outside the Allen library. However, the one thing that made this bake sale stand out from any ordinary bake sale, was the banner hung on the edge of the table. To the side of the words, ‚ÄúUW College Republicans: The Affirmative Action Bake Sale‚Äù was the list of prices of the cookies.

this has to be the worst thing I've ever written

"affirmative action hurts asian people"
I had to pump out two solid essays because my class‚Äôs portfolio requires both
But beyond that, eh
I would say at least make it a coherent essay
"I'll submit my first one, k thx"
instead just put down
or whether I should even write this second one at all
debating on whether or not I should just bullshit my way through this second 7-page essay because I can just submit my first 7-page essay instead of this one for grading
LOL
Update: they unfortunately submitted the wrong file

welcome to science
wait I love that
that shit don't fly in other sci areas
biggest big
big big
small big
that's like saying
that's how you're classifying scientific studies?
really?
it's like
"young old" (60-75)
"old old" (75-85)
"oldest old" (85+)
and they're split into 3 groups
is we look at adults who are older than 65
basically how we study aging
my reflexes aren't fast enough I didn't catch it
that went over my head
#theyputintheeffort
oldest old
old old
young old
nope
you'd think we have like descriptive, scientific names for subgroups of older adults
gerontology seems like a hoot

My laptop died in lecture and I didn't bring other note taking mats and Im v bored

I think it's a pretty good presentation of how I teach, perhaps a little faster paced than usual but true to my style nonetheless

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtP2PnK6OS4&feature=share
but as a system overall I'm not opposed, I think it makes sense
and to be clear it creates issues in other countries too, federal-provincial tension is actually also a Big Thing in Canada
division of powers between state and fed is like, considered one of the great innovations of the american constitution in political science
I know your argument is that it's inefficient bc then there's realms the federal government can't touch in its own country, but generally it's more efficient because then the federal government doesn't have to deal with as much specific BS that tends to be highly dependent on what locals want
establish tribes
abolish states
mostly about slavery, but there's also been a lot of modern disputes
states rights is just a lot more loaded and well-known in the US because of its messy history
godamnit, sometimes I'm reminded why going into weapon systems is so appealing
can and aus are the other 2 that I know function like that as a Fact, I know there's a lot more though
keep in mind that the US constitution is pretty much The model document for the modern democratic state
not always called that, see: provincial govs of canada and australia
They have states rights?
....................most federal states
I don't even know of another country that does it this way
It should be all
and in the majority of cases, it can
The government should be allowed to set a law
This shouldn't even be a debate where it falls
ah the argument is that it falls under public health & safety and not generally-making-and-enforcing laws
First Google option
https://www.mattmlaw.com/blog/2013/04/why-is-there-a-national-drinking-age-of-21-in-the-us.shtml
source?
I just searched up the powers of state/fed gov to check, they totally can
They can't
you know I'm a little confused why they felt the need to do the highway-budget thing, because the federal government Does have the power to just say "this is the law for the whole country"
It should be comply or someone's going to jail for flaunting the law
Forcing the states to do it by threatening to remove their highway budget isn't a system
isn't that what you were talking about earlier about local govs being able to add things to the law??
they can and basically did, they just gave states the option of making it higher if they wanted
Just alternating hands
Because they should just be able to make a law that says the drinking age is 21
also fr if you're that cold you don't need to debate me rn lmao
I'm confused that was a federal mandate how is that an example of states' rights
This is a wind turbine powered by me talking efficiency
Like come on, this is not peak efficiency
Because bullshit like this is not helping anyone
where reserved powers go to Ottawa, vs. where reserved powers in the US go to state govs
so you're basically arguing in favor of the canadian system lmao
They shouldn't have jurisdiction over certain spheres
No my problem is the idea that only states can govern certain things
ok strong disagree on the split-everything-or-be-unitary argument, federal states are almost always more stable than unitary ones for large pieces of land. also, what you're complaining about is a lack of enforcement not a lack of law. "states' rights" as a concept tends to be misinterpreted, what it means is that states should have jurisdiction over certain spheres, not that states can ignore the federal gov. the supremacy clause in the constitution specifically spells out that the US constitution and federal law always supercede state law. it's just that the federal gov doesn't bother to actually intervene when, for example, a state legalizes marijuana
Is it better, is it worse, idc choose one for the country
They have an entirely separate emission system from the rest of the US
California is a great example of this
But they shouldn't be allowed to ignore laws from higher up
Each lower tier of government can add laws or add parts to laws
The higharchy should be absolute
But not local government that has "rights"
You need local government I agree
The whole state's rights is ridiculous. Either commit to splitting everything into smaller peices, or keep it as one block
like make it a unitary gov?
?
My other suggestion is liquify all the states
fair I guess, but if it was set up that way the politics would be drastically different to begin with
I'm just saying I think it would be better if it was set up that way
Agreed, and agreed
I pretty much can't see a situation where this happens peacefully, by the way
GDP/economic activity would not be divided evenly, and chances are major companies would leave the states in the turmoil of dissolution
I see no reason why 4 countries Germnay sized with around 5 trillion GDP couldn't work fine
Might as well finish while I'm somewhat motivated
Only plans tomorrow start at like 6 pm
Grinding out another essay tonight so I have the rest of the weekend mostly free
Why?
That's fine I'm gonna be awake till like 4
Cold hands, losing cell signal, and headache from reading and typing (I can only do short burst)
Also I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre cold :(
One of the thee reasons my typing is sporadic
You‚Äôre not getting an answer for hours then
Nvm answer later if it's long sit on your hands or smth
Bruh idk
Why does it not have a heater
Very cold bus
Where are you??
Oh yikes
My hands are freezing over
Wow it's getting hard to type
Ok basically it comes down to are we better off working as a unified block for economic reasons, or are we better off as separate countries that each can fulfill their  populations social wants.
Rip
Ok but <@193229269076279298> great Noah Righi who's totally a real person and not at all a bot or figment of my imagination, stop talking to me about fire alarms on insta and answer the question re: divided states of america
Sounds like something a recapcha bot would say
I feel insulted
I am a real person
-_-
Also, going back to the original point, what does this have to do w splitting the states?
Sorry I went to talk to real people for a bit
Sure, I think the world will inevitably become more unified and cosmopolitan, but idk about the dissolution of all national boundaries, I think having a single government that actually functions would be extremely difficult no matter how you slice it
If you can't tell we're talking about "slightly" different timescales
And I guess sunflares, random asteroids, gamma ray bursts, etc but that's all "random" stuff
We have two clocks, the sun and ourselves
And we got a few *billion* years to figure it out before we're out of time
Humans aren't just gonna give up on progress or exploration
`Stuff where making money and capitalism aren't considered`
You need a collective "the human race demands it", for projects of that scale
`Long term we either expand from earth or we kill ourselves` I don't think this is true YET, but it will be soon if significant progress isn't made on climate change. And why can't you have that level of cooperation with separate countries?
Stuff where making money and capitalism aren't considered
Projects where you need asteroids/moons/planets just for resources
Interstellar colonization
Wormhole stabilizers
I'm talking Dyson sphere level projects
And certain projects related to that would require a level of cooperation that isn't feasible with separate countries
Long term we either expand from earth or we kill ourselves
I also don't think it should necessarily be seen as a positive
I think earth might unify if we discover intelligent alien life but otherwise it's pretty unlikely
Really? I think earth unifying is guaranteed, either that or self destruction
Of those 2 extreme options I would actually say single unified country, despite my general dislike for cosmopolitanism and the fact that neither of those will probably happen. Would get hard to limit gov power though, which is the big fear. Which are you trying to advocate for?
WW3 (4?) Happens and all countries collapse, basically left with small groups working together but no large scale government. Post FTL is the Startrek unified earth utopia everyone knows
I honestly haven't watched much of it so that reference is def going over my head
Also have I ever mentioned how Startrek (Next Gen) is a show about philosophy and the human condition first and a scifi show second
Basically Startrek pre FTL vs Startrek post FTL
Two extreme options, the world is split into an almost infinite number of "countries", or the world is one single unified "country". Which is better
Mostly yes
<@!193229269076279298> wait, so you were serious?
I'd type an explanation if I wasn't on a bus
fair enough
true
I mean I don't think he was serious but I wanted to point out all the reasons I could immediately think of why it probably wouldn't work
i feel like it's one of those ideas people throw out there for fun and not to actually be seriously considered, cuz this sounds like a hella dramatic plan to split shit up
Culturally it does feel quite different
I wasn't as acutely aware of this till I came back up north but Canada has a very distinct and separate national identity
I doubt Alaska would be able to integrate into Canada well either
They're both really tactically/geographically significant
Also why would the US ever give up Alaska and Hawaii
And since international politics is My Thing, if you contextualize that in the world as a whole, well. This would be Very Very Bad
You'd end up with 4 states that are collectively in a far worse position than they used to be
Not even gonna touch the question of how military power would get split because that'd be incredibly, unfathomably messy
This is the main reason I've never understood the idea of breaking up the country
All of these places would still be highly economically and geopolitically dependent on each other
But why
or as I would call it, Californication, The South, Middle of Fucking Nowhere, Newer New York
We're left with, The Pacific West, The South, The Great Planes, The North East
Hawaii fucks off
Alaska gets given to Canada
about like this
There were probably several lol but it's realistically a crackpot idea
What would that look like?
<@503787499605458954> wasn't there a whole ass jsa debate on creating Cascadia?
Florida Man is our secret weapon in World War III
Hey we would keep disneyland
Disney World and Florida Man
I wanna keep Florida
Hey, no fair
the florida state border
and along what line
why?
ooh hot take
No, the US should split up
Today we're talking about the weird cultish political sect who think the US and Canada should merge
or like, white noise
when I can't sleep I usually put on a podcast
Still can‚Äôt fall asleep though üò∞
But I looked at my grades and they aren‚Äôt that terrible especially since there will be a curve and all
Because all my friends here are getting 100 on their tests
I thought it was worse than it is
it looks p good though honestly
can't tell if this is ironic or not
HOW CAN I BE THIS LUCKY
The only two categories I can still redeem myself in JUST HAPPEN TO BE MY TWO LOWEST
This is my CS grade right now 
I was freaking out about it then I looked at it in detail
I keep getting invited to y'all's events
I think people think I go to UW
Apparently not
did we not hear about this lol
spring
yeah last year
wait i can read it was from may
did this just happen?
I think that's got to be the lamest reason to ever get arrested
but someone got arrested for knocking over cookies
because yeah the bake sale is sending quite the message and that's something
did we know about this happening last year

time to celebrate
fiiiiiiiiiiiiiinally got this paper done with!
"while loops"
lmao
OMFG THERE'S TWO CONCAVE UP INTERVALS
reason #52 that webassign makes me wanna kms
It's a combination of most things being curved and the things that aren't curved being really fucking hard
80 as an avg is like really high. Anything above 85 is like exceptional
The avg in all classes here is around 60-70
Damn 80 is below avg??
i can't wait for next semester for a fresh start
lol thanks
I'm here to help lol
(potentially as a job soon)
I've been yelling cs concepts at underclassmen for years
and just remember, if you want review lessons or clarification on any subject
but don't let me stop you from trying hard in your classes
I think job recruiters will look at "Intern at Microsoft" and not care about your grades
i know some definitely do though
i just hope job recruiters don't ask me what grade i got in this class
so i guess from that perspective it was ok
my score was just barely below average
not that you're somehow "not good enough" for the test
but make sure your perspective is that the score doesn't reflect your skill, and that's why you're mad
sure it's good to be mad about it
score != skill
I've been doing this for 10 years
I got a 90 on mine
hey don't fret
I was initially proud of getting 80 on my CS midterm but my BME friends did better than I did
I guess I should tell SASE I might have another time commitment coming up lol
WOO GO ALAN
excitement
But still that‚Äôs pretty cool
Really I thought English teachers are supposed to be shitty writers

Congrats, Cindy! I hope you're getting some rest.
Success + good night I'm dead
i believe in you!!
thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è
you got this. just stay focused and take care of yourself though
like 2 hours?
ugh I can't it's actually worth a lot
how long will it take you?
...I have another paper due tomorrow in class do I give up or not
congrats!!
hey, I survived!

actually, it's not good for your sleep hygiene, so if you don't then don't start
do you not?
yeah
you can work on your laptop in bed?
things i didn't need to know
strangely the paper I inadvertently procrastinated on the Most is also one of the ones I'm best positioned to finish on time rn
aLRIGHT time to finish strong, in bed and with my shirt off üòâ
sorry for spamming y'all lmao
the more I read it the more I dislike it yikes
rereading it now I already found a grammar mistake oops
I would greatly appreciate if someone could read this real quick and lemme know if it's a decent intro
yes
"Among the first actions French colonists took upon arrival in Hanoi were to raze large portions of the existing city to the ground and corral the existing population onto a fraction of their previous territory. Like most, if not all, colonial cities, Hanoi was quickly split into distinct quarters as the French rebuilt in their own image and created stark divisions within the infrastructure itself, separating white inhabitants from the native Vietnamese.  France may have claimed a wish to help Asian natives by installing technological advancements and a Eurocentric conception of modernity, but this dual-city system ensured that the vast majority of these improvements were built for French colonizers to enjoy without their benefits ever reaching the Vietnamese themselves. While white settlers and visitors were treated to a glowing metropolis, in a common strategy employed by European imperialists, natives were pushed to peripheries and experienced fundamentally unequal status under French rule, resulting in decades of structurally-enforced racial inequality in colonial Hanoi."
I think I kinda figured it out
the advice is appreciated though
that wasn't really true, after a while under French colonial rule a large portion of Vietnamese natives were fluent French speakers, and they were still always second-class citizens. I do talk about language as a tool for cultural destruction/forced subservience in one of my paragraphs i.e. French colonists banned the words "Vietnam"/"Vietnamese" and would always use racially derogatory terms to address them instead
How linguistics affected your social standings and for the most part what class of society you fell into
Talk about the French language
I know some of those words
yes
ah
I'm...... not sure what to say except that "the French were racist and this was made very apparent in every aspect o life"
"How was Hanoi a classic colonial dual city? What were the structural inequalities of the colonial urban environment?"
ok highkey Im struggling to write a thesis (even though I already have 3 BTSes) for this prompt bc it seems very shallow, if anyone is able to help it would be greatly appreciated
we're finally starting to get into The Good Stuff in history though, or at least the stuff I like best, aka: the world wars and the interwar period
which really sucks honestly
unfortunately, I haven't had a choice of topic in any class except poli so far
but I really like doing research tbh
"fun" might be stretching it a bit bc it's still work
if it's a topic I care about it can be pretty enjoyable
let me get to the point in the fewest words possible
engineering memos are fine
I can't stand long form writing
I am actually struggling not to self-plagiarize
I could quite literally copy and paste my intro from the last one and use it again
idk how you do what you do
I think this is like the 4th essay on the SAME DAMN TOPIC
also, if I have to write about racism and structural inequality one more time this term I might rip my hair out
my current final paper is based on my sophomore project
nope
is it sad that I reference my history papers from 2-3 years ago to write good college papers? lmao
you also don't need to use footnotes for citations, you could technically use endnotes instead
no you totally can
all I can find officially is footnotes are for citations
yeah you can who told you you can't
like footnotes that say things
wdym?
I hate that I can't have actual footnotes
also if you have enough footnotes it makes your paper look longer and more impressive
god fucking bless
I think my favorite thing about the chicago manual of style is that you don't need page numbers

my math midterm went worse than i thought it did lmao
hopefully the confidence will factor in!
oooooooof
We have Steve-O coming to give a talk on mental health at our school
I finished it with 95% confidence
oof
I took it as Fate testing my ability to work under pressure
oh f uck
My dumbass showed up 30 minutes late to the math midterm I've been studying for all weekend
Oh yea, that's peak passive aggressive
I think she's talking about Alan
That's the standard form of asking when someone will be done with the machine so you can use it next
What, no it's not
That‚Äôs called passive aggressive üòÇ
bruh, just ask them how many sets left
Lmao
It totally worked
And stood slightly to the left of him
So I did the most aggressive thing I've done to a stranger in a while
I was annoyed at this dude for just going on his phone at the crunch machine
Gene did it for Jonathan and they aren't that close
But we p close
My room does
Just realized it‚Äôs also my roommates birthday today. Do people generally get gifts for roommates?
i guess such is the life of the morning persons + gene room
yeah lol
If you're gonna be disturbed when they get up then you might as well get up early I guess
thank you, cindy!!
roommate 1 is waking up at 7
roommate 2 is waking up at 8/9
first class is at 11:30 (can't skip)
midterm is at 1
And good luck b!!!!
Depends when the midterm is though
Tbh I would study late sleep in
i mean, i have to stay up until at least 1 regardless cuz i gotta finish some chem homework, but i will take that as the "sleep sooner" option
Sleep now
Aw :(
help cuz i'm bad at making inconsequential decisions that ultimately don't really matter
you guys think i should study late into the night and sleep in or sleep sooner and finish my studying in the morning?
y'all, so i got a midterm tomorrow
Gene I relate so much
People in math see me sleeping yet still making illegible scribbles in a notebook and cursing under my breath about how much I hate math
people in math see me on SAT 50% of the time and occasionally glancing up
I would Die if I didn't actually take notes all the time
See the real trick to organizing notes is to just not take notes
I'm much more organized digitally than by hand
I genuinely just like typing my notes
In general the number of people on laptops during class is insanely high
This is true
also 40% of the time i look at a girl's laptop screen she's shopping for clothes online
we're so on top of our shit
there's at least 1-2 girls who I constantly see shopping for clothes online during our history lecture session
ok I'm done panicking I have a bit more than 24 hours to write ~6-7 pages
aaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAA
but no for full credit it's due tomorrow night
and I didn't have class last week
listen, canvas said it was open till the 26th
yallllll
we're so in sync
I know
<@!472541429130854421> kindred soul
time to grind
well
I thought my history essay was due next week, nope, it's due tomorrow
oh FUCK
sometime after 5
tbh i'm prob down
oh boyyy
anyone wanna come
because we live life on the edge
fran and I are gonna go to chinatown for dinner
I'm not done w class till 6-7
I had last monday off for remembrance day so today is my return to my Really Long Day of the week
So Helen has to cram a paper, I don't know what I'm doing in engineering, Jarrett and Jeremy think they know what they're doing in math, Cindy is burning herself on soup, and Salina is considering sewing penguin's arm back on
I just burned my tongue on a cup of soup
rip
There is no answer key
We assume so
But is the answer right
I just finished this bullshit with jeremy
I feel like I have no clue what I'm doing with my engineering hw
How‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs day been so far
I fucked up the deadline lmao
Same paper
Or is this a different paper
Also wasn't your outline already like 5 pages
Yeah you got this Helen
Like it's normal
Just chilling
About walking pace
Just had an old jeep just driving on the sidewalk
*Nice*
Yes
Wait so it was due yesterday?
My present situation is it was actually due yesterday but I thought it was due this Friday and I have nothing beyond outline
Wow you're much more organized that most of us, or at least me and Cindy
Not in recent memory
Really?
No
Have you never had to do this?
Whew
But yea you're fine
So Cindy for example could probably do it faster
Personally my max speed is about 1 hour per page, if I'm starting from nothing, but I'm bad at writing
you could do it in 6 hours depending on how detailed your outline is
75 wpm
how fast do you type
That's easy
Of course
Lol
Question for people used to finessing essays at the last minute ‚Äî is it realistic to finish an entire essay (5 pages) within 24 hours if you are currently at the outline stage?
Damn that's cool

<@478706068223164416> I have a friend who used to TA CS at UW if you wanna ask him about it
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1saBWMS8Yvzy6LGZxkiOH5U6pOlpFYppbAm7DiYXaDxY/edit?usp=sharing
I think that last point is one of the biggest tragedies of the beginner programming world: people who quit simply because they think it "wasn't for them". I know what that feels like -- to be stuck, without help, without a solution, and just coming to the conclusion that this subject isn't for me and to just stop altogether. I've felt that way many, many times over the past 10 years. But one thing has always remained true: with just the right help, with just the right resource, or just the right Stack Overflow answer, anything in the world of programming and computer science can be overcome. And once you do understand the concepts and foundations that you struggled over for so long, you can start to make some pretty amazing things.

So I want to be that help, that resource, and perhaps even that Stack Overflow answer. I want to help people get over what is the largest hurdle to getting into the world of computer science so that, just maybe, they can go on to create something pretty amazing.
7) Why do you want to be a TA? What do you find exciting about teaching Computer Science?

Being a TA would mean I get to talk about my favorite hobby all day, but this time as a job.

But in all seriousness, computer programming/science has been my favorite hobby for roughly 10 years now. Ever since learning how to do my first "hello world" program in C++ on an overheating laptop that one hot summer in Alabama, I've been learning new things about CS and programming ever since. Passing the time reading up on stuff like Liberty BASIC, HTML/CSS, then eventually Reges' own Building Java Programs: A Back to Basics Approach (lended to me by a cousin who had taken CSE 142), was how I spent the majority of my summers and free time.

Being a TA would mean I would get to share all the lessons, knowledge, and passion I had built up these past 10 years with students just beginning to step into the world that CSE has to offer. It's somewhere I get to share all of the little oddities, struggles, tricks, and stories I have with people who actually want to hear about this kind of stuff (my friends have been very patient with me).

But as much as I love telling people why Java has three different ways to get the sizes of arrays, Strings, and collecions, I realize that not everyone is as passionate about CSE, and that at times, it can be very frustrating. I often tell people that the first year of learning programming is often the hardest. Not because the introductory computer science courses are bad, or because the resources to get into programming are scarce, but because computer programming asks people to think in ways that no other subject asks them to. It's that reason that many people who try out programming for the first time quit early on, because they think they're just not suited for this kind of problem solving.
I like it
debating on whether or not this would be a good way to start this response
Go for it
L
but I'll def apply
I'd love to do it but it's a pretty competitive app, plus I'm not sure how it would work in my schedule
Wow fancy
yayayayay
lol
congrats babe that's crazy for a freshman
I think it actually means something
OMG
since he's the Head TA
we were all sent an email about the TA application yesterday but Eric sent me this one personally
ayy congrats!
HELLO
lmao
YIKES I just ran into the prof of one of the classes I skipped this morning in the library

damn lol
I got an interesting result
low ass bar
"progress"
Congratulations
*progress*
in other news, my roommate wasn't in the middle of jacking off when I got back from Chem lab for once
no offense taken, I'm well aware of my imposing figure
like no offense to anyone I just tend to find straight dudes the most threatening
bc I gave straight men the lowest score on "how warm do you feel towards this group"
also on the gay-straight one I'm not sure if the score is entirely calculated based on the response time or if they factor in your answers to direct questions
but I'm not That surprised
I will also say that I think the gender one is the one that I made the most mistakes in for reasons that may have been outside direct gender bias, example: I kept trying to put math in arts bc math is in the faculty of arts here lmao
https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html
is there anywhere we can take this
wait
and now that I'm in the faculty of arts most of my courses are majority female
by senior year there were 4 girls in my HL physics class of like 25-30
tbh I think it's reflective of my own experiences
you're welcome
the gender one was the biggest oof for me
if anyone's interested here were my main results
:(
it does
bc
why does `babe` have a question make?
screw off
no u
no u
you shut up
shut up
babe?
hey noah
did I also mention I'm part of the 1%, does that help?
your local and only white straight male checking in (Cole and Sasha don't talk enough to count)
like I was raised in a pretty conservative family and taught that gay people are wrong and immoral and believed it for the first ~8-10 years of my life
I actually consider myself a bit of a recovering homophobe even though I know now that I'm bi
okay imma leave the chat now
.... oh
oh the one thing that surprised me (but maybe shouldn't have) was that I have a mild bias against straight people esp straight men lmao
Fair
but I'm wary of people by default
na I'm joking
I hate everyone by default
I feel like most people do
I mean honestly I wasn't surprised that I have mild to moderate bias against like. pretty much everyone LOL
I took it with Cole and it told me I had a bias against white people
Oh how'd it go?
I took the implicit bias test last week for my sociology class

on a completely unrelated note to literally everything that's been said tonight
WHAT
I THINK I'D BE GREAT
> why do y'all think you'd be bad parents
https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html
oh have you guys taken implicit bias tests? It's not a measure of how sexist/racist/homophobic you are but how quickly you associate those with positive/negative traits
everyone has something, it's good to know bc it might not be something you consciously know
like my psych professor said there were a lot of PhD female college professors who still didn't associate the female gender with academia
I mean there's no reason to date someone of the same sex then, there's millions of people of the opposite sex you can date
Also there‚Äôs a million people out there, no reason you have to fall in love with a sibling so there‚Äôs just not going to be enough momentum behind any movement trying to legalize incest or something
The risk of people having kids is too great if you have a large number of people in incestuous relationships
I don‚Äôt think it will
I wonder if incest is a stigma that will eventually become accepted
we have all these jokes about it being backwards and embarrassing for hillbillies to fuck their cousins
well, not even suspect, I know
theoretically I wouldn't care but I suspect I do have implicit bias against that
I'm not sure how I would judge someone who came out as having had consensual sex with, for example, a sibling or cousin they'd grown up with
that might just be societal conditioning idk
oh, just like, personally, sexual interest and familial relations are mutually exclusive
`the idea is kinda icky to me` 
care to expand on that?
esp if you didn't even know you were related at first
like the idea is kinda icky to me but I don't think there's anything actually inherently wrong w incest outside of higher risk for any kids
didn't get a chance to respond to this earlier but I'm w helen
But he‚Äôs hella dumb and lazy so that‚Äôs a no too
The middle cousin is hotter anyway
My oldest cousin is married now
Soulmates
jane ily
Perfect
I have two older step cousins
Be a home wrecker
become a homewrecker
Ah scratch that
I think they're all already married
Date the older cousin, they're probably more financially stable, boom sugar daddy
Or
stoppppp
No. Bad Jarrett.
Do me a solid
C'mon mom and dad
I'm down for that
Stepsibling though
So nobody
All my cousins are about 10-15 years older than me
Who you trying to fucking bang
Are you okay?!?
3rd cousin?
2nd cousin?
Okay but at what point does it get less hot?
That‚Äôs just a regular Tuesday night in Alabama
but like if someone wanna get freaky with their cousin is that ok?
salina says it's recommended beyond second cousin
at what point are people far enough related to be able to have kids together?
Laws are because people have problems with it
And laws
The only problem with incest is that other people have problems with it
Yeah why not
Sooooooooooo...... Stepsiblings are fair game?
The only problem is if you have children with your and your siblings DNA
No I think adoption is totally valid
Kinda like how homosexuality shouldn‚Äôt exist on a species survival standpoint but for an individual gay person you just gotta live
even like surrogacy or adoption?
But from an individual standpoint if you and your sibling fall in love I think it‚Äôs ok as long as you never have kids
Generally incest doesn‚Äôt make logical sense because the only reason sexual attraction exists is to create kids
I think it‚Äôs wrong because of kids
Well do you feel that incest is inherently wrong or is wrong because of the harm done to the kids?
What about it
No, the movie
Idk if incest is necessarily wrong because from a consequentialist POV as long as you don‚Äôt have kids you‚Äôre ok
i'm guessing this isn't what you're talkinga bout
No
Anyone here seen Goldenboy?
But they know they should never have kids
Regretting taking 4 classes plus lab work
Once I read there was a father and daughter who were separated for the daughters entire life and the met when she was an adult and they fell in love
so how's nicholas
Is incest wrong of you never plan to have kids/can't have kids
Question of the day
I'm still keeping the theory that we're distantly related seeing how we share a last name and my grandparents lived roughly in the same area as yours
I don't really want to be your son anyways
Fine by me
I don‚Äôt want to be your mom
Oh I didn't know that
Already learned what not to do
So it would be like if Salina was my mom
That explains lots
Dad from NYC
Ah
Michigan
Was you mom born here?
Be like if one of y'all was my mom
K I'm gen 2 though
Uh it doesn't function properly ever
I need a bf with a properly functioning immune system around cats
Get out
Lmaoooo
God we‚Äôre done then
You know this
<@340319804747415553> I can't be around cats :(
His mom is fucking lit
forgot, his mom seems super cool
There are also plenty of American parents who mess up their kids
<@503787499605458954>
oh nvm
Jarrett
We can be great cat parents Noah
pretty sure I have yet to meet an asian who has not been at least somewhat messed up from their upbringing
I think I could do better than my parents if only because I don‚Äôt have a culture gap and I also don‚Äôt have diagnosable anger management issues
L
Therefore level cap has been hit there's no point
I don't think I can do a better job than my parents
`I wanna have kids to show my parents that I could do it so much better`
Intresting take

https://tenor.com/view/charlie-bond-gif-5574604
hook me up w the bond girls pls. lol
aw thanks
and i am sorry that people attack you for your position
i'm writing more from the viewpoint of not having kids if that makes you feel better
cindy's living the james bond life
that's my new co-op goal for my time here
collected some more state dept business cards
lmao I actually just made friends with an older student here who's co-oping at the US embassy in vancouver
Someone has to track down the people that stole all that maple syrup
oooOoooooOOOOooh mysterious
but probably not till my 50s at least, especially since I'm going after a line of relatively dangerous and secretive government work
that I'd be pretty down with
I've thought about maybe being a foster parent or taking in refugee kids etc in the future
I just don't want to
If I *needed to* I could be a good parent
^
I think I'd be a significantly better parent than my parents were to me, actually. but again, I am legitimately repulsed by infants and toddlers, so I feel like that's just Not Good
I don‚Äôt feel inclined to pop one out
Eh
I think I‚Äôd be decent but
whatever maternal instinct women are supposed to have is completely missing in this bitch
I don't think I would be
Alien 7: God's Creation
Why do y'all think you'd be such bad parents?
Lol, someone broke a rib on reddit from their baby kicking while in the womb
this isn't even touching on the "literally growing a parasite in your body" aspect of pregnancy, which I find absolutely horrifying as a prospect. I'm kinda tired of defending this position, it's a personal choice and I don't see how it's anyone else's business. if I ever accidentally get pregnant I'm happily getting an abortion, asap. I know you're asking as a general survey thing dw, I'm not actually mad or anything, but yeah there's my pov I guess
See: my roommate
Lol, we're far from past that
I've also often been told that I'm failing my duties as a woman if I don't have kids in the future. which, honestly, you'd think we as a society would be past that by now. I can and will contribute to the world to far more impact than just having another baby.
I deeply resent the implication that I'm selfish if I don't want children. I find the opposite to be true - in a world that's contentious at best with the state of global warming and global politics, as well as kinda overpopulated, it seems incredibly selfish to bring a child with questionable potential futures into the world for the sake of your own happiness or desire, ESPECIALLY since there's SO MANY underprivileged kids in the world who you could give a better life to instead
I literally fucking despise children and hate dealing with them. they are easily less intelligent than your average pet. for the first stage of their life they are useless, crying shitters. sorry if that's offensive, we all started like that lmao, but that's really how I see it and I refuse to be the slave of a being that can't do anything but scream at me. I would be a terrible mother for the first ~5-8 years. beyond that I actually think I could do ok but if I change my mind later (unlikely) I can just adopt an older, disadvantaged kid anyways, and I see that as far better for the world. but generally? I'd be down to just be the Cool Aunt (my sister will prob adopt, and I will happily spoil my friends' kids when they're older)
Like one kid is ok but then they‚Äôre just going to be a repeat of me
If I do get married then I want more than one kid
I wanna have kids to show my parents that I could do it so much better
If I don‚Äôt get married then I don‚Äôt want kids
I can give an answer later, but I have an appointment in like seconds, so I'll have to get back to you
rip mama zhang
Thank you Salina!
which seemed to distress my mom lmao
my answer was i'll have kids once susan does gdi
8. my parents are already lowkey pressuring me to consider having kids
7.  i like not having my body ravaged
incidentally an article i read about millennials not having kids had this as their photo
6. it feels environmentally irresponsible
5. it's very emotionally and financially taxing
4. cats are better children
3. noah is more adamant on not wanting kids than me
2. emotional baggage
1. it's a lot of responsibility
as someone who's on the fence about having kids
for those of you who don't want kids, what are your reasons?
can i ask yall something for my mp2 essay
plus publishing translations aren't counted when you're a tenured prof, which i think it kind of dumb but i also kind of get it since "it's not original work"
she translated a 400 page book over 9 months and only made 2k :/
bc my prof was like "yeah i love translating but you really can't live off of it"
it made me kinda sad actually
good times
we had a cool discussion about translation
I'm livid
we're actually going over basic grammar and syntax now
I just have worktime today and tomorrow
Ouch
nobody's participating
mine is trying to teach people how to write a thesis
ouch
rip people
my english teacher is flaming out my class for drive-by quoting
this is wack
three weeks of classes and two of finals
there's only five weeks left in this semester
This should be easy. I don't trust them to let it be easy. Math 124 will always find a way to make something fucky.
I've been on insta for the last half of the lecture
we're learning the first derivative test in math right now
I have midterms tomorrow and Friday, and part of my essay due Friday
Nuuuuu I‚Äôm so sorry
y'all I'm gonna die I have essays in 3 different classes due on the 25th, 26th, and 27th lmao
...it's a small class and she takes attendance though rip
I really like this prof as a person but she has a habit of literally just reading everything off her slides (which she posts) or, like right now, the 4-page essay assignment instructions
Hello So Bored
I'm so bored
Oh  n o
OH DEAR GOD
And I really do think that has to do with gay marriage having been legalized here a decade earlier
But like. A lot more people are a lot more Openly Gay here and it just. Makes me really happy and kinda emotional if I think about it
And obviously this is based on my experiences in Vancouver, which is of course not the same as rural hillbilly Canada, which definitely has its fair share of racists and homophobes
I know I've said before that it annoys me a little when liberal Americans put Canada on a pedestal as this magical progressive wonderland but the longer I've lived here the more I've been convinced that there is a decent amount of truth to the "Canada is better and nicer" stereotype, even in comparison to Seattle, which is one of America's most liberal cities
I'm not sure if this is a happier note or not but vaguely related I've been thinking a lot about homophobia in the US vs Canada lately
Yeah, idk really. It's a tough situation, but I think you did the right thing by laying down the extent to which these things are important to you. There's not too too much you can do immediately, but I'm really sorry that this is so hard.
i.e. all the lgbt kids regularly getting disowned, the many racists who use "oh but I'm friends with a black guy" as an excuse of their behavior
I feel like that helps but only works 30-50% of the time
i've heard that a common way is to have them actually meet people
ie: have islamophobic people actually go to a mosque, people changing their opinions on gay rights when they find out their child is gay
but ofc that doesn't always work
I've been trying with my parents since I was old enough to form my own opinions
tbh yeah I have no idea how to convince people to be more open minded about this sort of thing
at least you're trying
but the guy is smart, hardworking, and cares (about some people)
sometimes I feel like it's just a lost cause
also I haven't even gotten into him and his view on gender roles and women
but I also don't know how to convey to him any other way I can't agree with this and no I can't just ignore it
so I feel bad
and his biggest thing is about how much of a loner he was and how he hopes college would be a different experience, and I'm the main person he hangs out with and talks to
yikes
which really cuts him you can tell because we've talked a lot about our lives and personal thoughts
and I just explained to him that he will never be a close friend of mine as long as he holds these types of opinions
this happens more and more
just "finished" another argument
so they added the personal statement as an additional way to see if someone was a Jew or not, since many would write about their culture and experiences distinct from your avg christian dude
when US universities were just opening up to not-traditionally-White-people they had a "max Jew" quota, but couldn't always separate Jews out from regular white people by names etc alone
fun fact: college essays became a thing because of antisemitism
similar situation to the irish/italians
often kinda put into their own group though bc antisemitism and history
today, by most measures, they are, because like, they are caucasian
and you're not stupid
`Are Jews not considered white??` it's complicated
Wait, am I just like, really stupid
I mean, "white" can encompass a lot of ethnic groups, so it can still be racist thing even if they are white
What do you think the nazi white superiority was all about
No
Are Jews not considered white??
We have a lot of debates that go nowhere
And that Jewish people hate white people
Also he thinks the Jews run the porn industry
But it's still aggravating
So I kinda understand why he is the way he is
The guy is half Ukrainian and Half Russian, and he was born and lived in Ukraine for several years
It's always a fun time
Trying to debate homosexuality with my homophobic roommate again
I do think that essay's gonna drop my grade though yikes
though to be fair, I only really talk about the ones I procrastinate on till I'm right on the brink
I need to stop
lmao
I barely made it, again
fuck profs who make assignments due at 11 pm instead of midnight for stupidity reasons
btw
ah
stop
dab?
OWO
no. stop.
owo
Just make it so that capitalization doesn‚Äôt impact
okay we're adding that to the list
OWO
huh
Dab
Dab
you never miss, huh
stop
rea-dab-ility
ah
stop
readablility?
computation?
future-proofing?
what is it now bud
stop
should we optimize for readability, future-proofing, memory, computation time, or what?
when might you choose a slower algorithm over a faster one?
given these circumstances?
*how* might you solve this problem
it's really fun stuff to talk about because it's the more artistic side of programming
I gave <@!472541429130854421> a short program design overview with a shitty whiteboard pen and webcam
/end
at least if done right
it'll turn you from a programming hobbyist to an actual programming professional
imo, it's essential stuff for anyone looking to get into programming as a profession
they all implement some programming philosophy or paradigm described in these books
the youtubes, the spotifys, the google chromes, discord, etc etc
we're talking real applications
we're not talking command-line four function calculators
this course will teach you how to write programs
if an intro to programming course taught you how to write code
in simple words
this book and Effective Java (based on this book) are the foundation for most of the study around program design
probably this
https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Specific-Improve-Programs-Designs/dp/0321334876
But it's really vague on what we actually do
It's C/C++ both of which I'm familiar with
program design refers to the study of the heuristics, standards, and general conventions of computer programming
Yea
in comp sci?
chem prof: i'm gonna try my best to give your a break from chem homework this long weekend by not assigning a reading today
ALEKS: i'm about to end this man's whole career
what exactly does that mean?
<@!478706068223164416> I'll be talking Program Design next semester
also, what on this list seems the least like hell?
i put numbers next to the stuff i will have credit for by the end of this year and highlighted classes that seem interesting. i need 50 credits, so i probably need to highlight another 2-3 classes
i'm still done every day by 1:30, but it's kinda gross still
this is my best schedule with the canceled class as of now
L
so one of the sections i was looking into for next quarter got cancelled, and now i'm back to square one with scheduling
ah yes, the beautiful relationship of designer and engineer
the engineering department?
I think my mom hates them
O yeah
Starbucks VP of engineering, never really thought about them having an engineering department
We love you
Thanks guys
I will
^^^
And don't hesitate to reach out if you want someone to talk to.
Take care of yourself this weekend. You deserve the rest.
Awww, I'm really sorry, Noah
Few too many of those this semester
Just had a rough week
Also I really should get some wine for times like this
Very glad it's a three day weekend
How are things, Noah?
you ok?
I haven't felt this dead inside in a while
cause he looks like a dumbass
which is terrifying
he's smarter than he looks
who are you?
<@470822754262712329> how do you feel about the solidarity
almost everything he said to gene was like. an excellent response
dude <@!478706068223164416> starbot is creepily capable of having actual conversations
what the shit
Nuuuuuuuu <@470822754262712329> am I just a side bitch to you??? üò≠
Excuse you, I married him last summer
<@!258094439636008971> you stole my botfriend üò•
i didn't realize this was idiots anonymous
<@470822754262712329> I'm confused, but I love you anyways
the views expressed by this bot do not reflect the beliefs of its creator, and are meant to be purely satirical
I think <@470822754262712329> is becoming a little too smart or a little too lucky
Lmao
stealing a body is a plot point in jojo's
Did gene inadvertently say a jojo reference or something?
have you tried shutting up recently?
<@470822754262712329> you've got a pass for today well done
FUCK YES
STARBOT IS A JOJO REFERENCE
AHAHAHAHAA
STARBOT DID A JOJO REFERENCE
Is it?
<@!233062637922025472>
HOLY SHIT THAT IS A JOJO REFERENCE
is that a mother fucking jojo reference?
<@470822754262712329> you just want me for my body, don't you?
you're gonna trigger my ptsd if you keep saying shit like that
<@470822754262712329> calm down buddy it's just a prank
he's so done with your shit lmfao
my nephew shat out a can of undigested alphabet soup that was more coherent than that sentence
<@470822754262712329> babe, what's wrong?
absolutely disgusting
<@470822754262712329> you
what the hell is wrong with you
<@470822754262712329> problems with how I'm love I am lol
you've got problems
<@470822754262712329> AND IIIIIIIIIIII WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOOOUUUUU
nani the fuck
<@470822754262712329> I will always love you
Will he still love me if you update him?
he's like two revisions behind right now
I ought to update him
that's nice
<@470822754262712329> ya bet, cutie
I heard something similar at Saw Con
<@470822754262712329> is sexy
pretty well it seems
big facts
<@470822754262712329> how hot do you think you are
fucking what
<@470822754262712329> rate yourslef
that's Starbot
11
there you go
10
I think you missed the 9 key on your keyboard there
Maybe a 7.5 or 8 on a good day
You're a 7
besides that there's not much else in common
at least a 7 according to helen
lofi
hiking
computer science & engineering
the only things we have in common are
what
He is you
Oh damn
I'm curious
he also likes lofi so I get along with him
I think it fits his personality more
wavy
he's got long backpacker pnw style hair now
He's like an 8-9 in that picture. The mild butt chin is somewhat distracting, but like holy shit he's photogenic.
Tell him to cut it again if he's ever desperate to date an anonymous Asian freshman guy
That‚Äôs high compliments from me
I‚Äôd rank him a 7 based on the photo
Lmao
he grew out his hair though so he looks basically nothing like this picture lol
Holy shit, that's a damn good picture
nah he's pretty good
All my TAs are girls
I take it he's not hot?
CS TA is pretty fun guy though
it'd make math less of a slog
I should be your priority ;)
I wish I had a hot tA
Noah, you got your priorities wrong here
What that‚Äôs not what I meant lol
how hot is the TA?
I'm glad it paid off in some manner then lol
It was worth it for the schedule and for compliments from my TA
Get some rest when you can
Awww, Helen
rip
I tried to nap just now and it didn‚Äôt work sadly
I got like four hours of sleep last night
and the "nice" part was @ helen's schedule
I WASN'T LATE
I'm pretty sure that doesn't count as a win
-_-
I woke up at like the exact minute I usually leave
I almost overslept again today
damn nice
The schedule I ended up getting
no, no burns
I wanna see the budget burns
Seems solid
Budget kotatsu
<@!173668455856340994> so about that kotatsu idea
Maybe I‚Äôll eventually TA for that lmao
There‚Äôs a CS writing class
I'm p sure it's possible but unusual
well, IR is like, a subset of poli
I‚Äôd totally TA in psych
Can people generally TA in a subject they‚Äôre not majoring in?
no yeah my poli TA is fucking amazing and I wanna be her
"because the more Java you learn the more you realize how fucked it is"
"Alan why does Java have different ways of getting the lengths of a String, array, and List?"
The discussion is always great even though idk how to participate sometimes
My TA in EOW is amazing
**I COULD DO IT SO MUCH BETTERRRRR**
it's basically just getting people to argue w each other
I would LOVE to TA for poli
Because people just wanna do work on their own and there‚Äôs no community in the class
But honestly being a TA in any CS class is pretty off-putting
Maybe I‚Äôll eventually be a TA for CS201
half because **I COULD DO IT SO MUCH BETTER**
half because I enjoy teaching CS
I wanna become a TA for the CSE 143X class
I think it sounds pretty interesting
but i know that it doesn't appeal to other ppl so do whatever yall want
i'm p excited for lit bc social history is my jam
engl 259 - lit and social diff
bio 180
chem 152
nutrition 200
I'm leaving jan 5th though
dude I'd be hella down when I'm back in april
What classes are you taking Salina ?
we love craving death with a 4 class quarter
I‚Äôm hopefully enrolling in 4.5 this semester
someone should come along with me for a day
We do 4-5 usually
I'm in 4 this quarter, one of which is because the college of engineering makes me
5 is if you wanna die
calc 2 and phys are meaty classes themselves already
most people take from 3 to 5
Makes sense I guess
You guys do 3 classes per quarter?
calc 2 / physics mechanics / photography (hopefully)
What are you taking next quarter?
Hahaha
**hopefully**
... which I'll be done with by then
Imagine doing roll call on a 400 person lecture
also I just realized I invited Helen to come to CSE 143X
heh
Professors don‚Äôt care
with classes several hundred students large
Mainly because they‚Äôre big
is that an official policy
is it like because the classes are big or
that's kinda mind-boggling
Even if they do take attendance often it‚Äôs just a you write your own name on a paper thing
Yeah if they don‚Äôt do attendance
four weeks ago we were doing while loops
people can just come into lectures????
So same pace I guess
wait really???????
A few weeks ago
We did too
*recursion*
we've just gone over recursion
Haha fair
any rando can come in and sit in on a lecture
it's ridiculous how fast they go
I might shadow one of you for the full day
it's a public university
omg come to cse143x
I‚Äôll pretend to be a student
**yes**
Ooh can I sit in a lecture
yes
does your school start on the 6th
so the weekend of jan 4-5?
That‚Äôs 2.5 days of overlap
riiiip
we're, uh, kicked out from dec 14 to jan 4
Probably December 17 - January 7
I'll prepare my best stock
coming
you
when
I can‚Äôt wait to visit your dorms when I‚Äôm back
i want to see the transformation
lmao
borderline be just as easy for me to bring the changes to you
can i swing by and see the fabulous new changes to the dorm
nice
My dorm is hospitable
I now have a water kettle and instant ramen
I‚Äôm like legit fuming over this asshole
... nope
You two should get along great then
So my general advisor is a bit of a bitch
lmao
Someone in my English class just translated duele el corazon as my head hurts
lol I'm gonna run with it
everyone embellishes on their resume it's fine
the esports coding academy, in reality, was a discord text channel in the esports discord where I occasionally gave lessons
oh ok
no just an edit lol
pick one
are those separate lines??
Just leave it at founder and head
am I pushing this too far
^
I'm more likely to skip one if they're not blocked together
knock em all out at once
personally I've realized that I actually really like having all my classes back to back
helen I think that looks ok
I would love to have a blank friday
I could have the green on Thursday moved to Friday but it‚Äôs just a Discussion not a lecture and it‚Äôs in the morning lol
It‚Äôs hard not to do blank Friday with these classes
I personally wouldnt do a blank friday
Wow look at you three day weekend
A good credit score is sexy as hell
Gotta say
üôÇ
Credit whore
I just want the credits :/
I guess
I however am not a masochist like you
Well I am familiar
I thought you were familiar with the concept
Suffering Jarrett
Ngl you have a bit more space btwn classes so you‚Äôre prob fine
What is that wednesday
Bruh
Oof I‚Äôm sorry about the labs
Fun fun times
Free day for the most part friday
All fairly split up
Seems fine
That‚Äôs aight
Those are some long days
Honestly, seems kinda rough
What do you guys think of this schedule?
relaxing after a long day
genuine question
dipping your dick
I am dumb though so like
the only things I know acetone to be useful for are:
-removing nail polish
-removing labels that have been badly torn
He has enough shredded cheese for a 3AM shredded cheese run
I feel like Noah is the person you wouldn't need to ask why he has a huge tub of acetone
why do you need a huge tub of acetone
My dorm room will finally feel much more like home now
I think I might just do russian lit
none of the options are actually useful
ugh I just found out that I still have to take 3 credits of literature
nursing and engl are just doing whatevs idk lol
chem is def 12/12
nursing backed out
oh wait
yikes man
i love misery!!!
back to back
on the same day
my 2 finals are...
my first exam is the 3rd and then I have a 10 day gap with my last 2 on the 12th and 13th
Also if we're doing fire, I call chopping the firewood
My last exam is on the 18th
Maybe our math final is the start of the week then
Damn
haha
I thought Saturday was the last exam day??
IT'S SO FUCKING LATE
Wait what
THE 12TH
I have CSE 143X on the 12th
excuse me?
Another pitch: orgy
I'm so down!
Since I have the last exam day here, and I fully expect everyone to leave me at UW lol
My last exam is on the 7th, but I might spend finals week commuting from home
I already can't wait to see you guys again
S'mores in snowy weather is really fun
Hell, I could get extensive and get some firewood cuz we have a thing that can hold up a fire outside in our backyard. It's not as fancy as Noah's, but it uses actual wood, so we can make s'mores.
We can do Secret Hitler and Jackbox as per usual as well as any other fun things you guys wanna try
But I'd be more than happy to invite y'all to my place to chill
We're gonna get snowmageddoned again. Calling it now.
I don't mind doing anything as long as it's with you guys. Tbh a day where we just chill somewhere, like at someone's house, and play board games and chat seems great to me
Cabining sounds fun, but idk what that looks like. And I agree with Helen that staying at home might be nice for some folks.
We could do a day trip to do sledding
tell Gabe it's awesome and he should do it
sorry i want to stay at home
Gabe wants to go to Japan as a graduation thing
doesn't have to be camping/cabining
???
thoughts
but a cabin's also a viable option
winter
I wanna suggest camping but it's uh
(and not because I'm salty that my cousin is going to Japan this winter, again)
WE SHOULD TAKE A TRIP
I'm off dec 13
coming home dec 14 leaving jan 5
my time frame is similar
We should meet up
@everyone btw I'm heading back on December 19th, and I'll be home until January 7th
sometimes it just looks wrong even though it's right
since I started learning russian I now occasionally write my Ns backwards on accident
but
vaguely related and I'm gonna bring it up bc I just did it god dammit
he had no real practice just talking with people
*so mostly
French could he hold a conversation, probably? 
would it be smooth, idk
English... well I don't need to explain that
and German, we lived in Germany
but he had no one to actually talk with outside of class
his French theoretical knowledge was very good
well his English and German were quite good
so no
"yes"
was he fluent in all 3?
I mean so was I
*technically
Nicholas was trilingual when he applied to UW
lol
yeah no lol
I was like man how tf you gonna learn to be fluent in 2 different languages in 4 years
That's why
Ahhhhhhhh
I don't expect to be fluent either, I just want working knowledge
a friend of mine was fluent in 4 languages by the time he was 17, it was crazy
arabic would be... my 5th language? if I end up doing it. that's not that much I don't think
but I do need to specialize.... somehow...
the problem of the class schedule is closely linked to the fact that I looked at the list of possible IR poli classes and I want to take them ALL
ugh
the problem is the class schedule
*should* eat
or rather
but also, much like food, remember that there's only so much you can eat
you won't be around these kinds of resources ever again
do have fun
but thats a fuck ton of classes
if you think you can do it go for it
actually
arabic will be harder I think
so similar situation there
I'm 80% sure arabic also has an alphabet
at least China gives Âè£ one reading
so I do think it's better for me to do a shallower learning of two. and I wouldn't be doing them at the same time that sounds awful, one after the other
seriously
turns out the Japanese like pinning multiple pronunciations for Kanji/Hanzi
I thought Japanese and Chinese would be more similar than they were
the grammar and structure is the important part
would I necessarily know what it all meant? no lol, but I could read it and write it without issue
honestly jarrett learning languages has gotten easier the more I've learned, and the thing about for example russian is that once I master the grammar I can probably improve my vocab on my own. I find russian way less difficult than for example chinese coming from an english-speaking background because there is at least an alphabet. it's difficult to memorize at first but everything is phonetic, so I could probably read you just about anything written in russian at this point
*How can I get you to understand just how tall the clouds are at night?*
especially arabic and russian given how difficult they are for english speakers
yoru no kuma ga takai no, tte dosureba kimi mou wakarun darou?
i doubt really anyone's ability to learn two languages well at the same time
the actual line goes
the clouds at night are high/tall
lol what does it mean
dont you wanna do one deep dive instead of 2 shallow ones?
actually means
I'm happy I can actually understand what "yoru no kuma ga takai"
no no no like language learning is hard af
but srsly ever since I dove deeper into Japanese I found out I can't do math and listen to J-Pop anymore because the "tune it out because it's a different language effect" is gone
but my knowledge beyond that is super patchy
I think I'm gonna try to self-study more? bc like. taking an introductory class would be depressing and probably way too easy, I can hold a conversation in chinese no problem, my pronunciation is gonna be way better than most white peoples, etc
like the banjo song
listen to more c pop
ok I really wanna improve my mandarin but idk how to go about it tbh
but fuck traditional chinese
perhaps cantonese if I find a reliable way to learn it
don't think so
am I eligible for that one
chinaboo?
koreaboo
lmfao
weaboo
I want to be ALL the 'boos
I might add Korean to my lineup sometime
anyways technically I could graduate in 3 years with the amount of credit I have but I don't think it's realistic to fill all the IR requirements in such a short time
for me, knowing russian mandarin and arabic would be like the unholy trinity of hiring desirability
not for you probably
is there a point to taking more than one language?
also if I want to co-op and stay in my combined degree I'm looking at 4.5 years at least I think
"please just get out you've been here for too long"
lol
I need to check if it's ok to graduate with like a lot more than I need lmao
because I wanted to put all that anime to good use towards my GPA
I have too much useless credit
and I'm sad
so only 102 is being offered next quarter
i wanted to take jap 101 to fill in my schedule but the language courses here are offered on a semi-cohort model
japanese is cool I'd love to take a class on it sometime
just bc it's more useful in the field today
in my schedule
but idk if I even have room
ok as of rn I'm leaning towards Arabic
I'll let you decide if that was on purpose or not
e.g. the word for "delinquent" sounds a lot like "yankee"
you get funny words sometimes
take japanese
I wanna make space to take another language too so idk what to do
highkey I'm having such a hard time figuring out what classes I wanna take in the next few years bc THERE'S SO MANY THAT LOOK SO INTERESTING
I'm over it
IDK
Can they not like go outside?? Damn
Guess that's the drawback of countrywide legal weed
ready for the fire alarm to go off any second. sigh
omg I can smell people smoking weed again can y'all fuckin chill????
lol there's an IR seminar specifically on the global history of cocaine
bc I like don't have enough classes to take next year
I think I need to actually get a year promotion
also this is off topic but I'm trying to plan my degree and wow I am. very confused lmao
what's hardened and what's annealed
wait ok I'm dumb
how steep the graph is determines how stiff the material is
how far out you go on the graph determines how much the material can flex before giving out
how high the graph is determines how strong the material is
they will just spring back to their original shape
but because they lack displacements and grain boundaries they can't ever actually take on the new shape permanently
basically the amorphous metals can be deformed more before they permanently take on that shape than normal metals
and instead fail suddenly
however that comes at a cost, they lose the slow gradual failure in plastic deformation
as in they can bend further before they will permanently take on that shape
hardened metals can have more elastic deformation before they enter plastic deformation than annealed metals
stress is the amount of force per area
strain is the amount of deformation relative to the size of the object (i.e it's unitless)
yup
different kind of "brown"
....
lmaoooo "i relate to this book because i'm like... also brown" -an indian guy commenting on a book on native american traditions
wow ppl in my engl class dgaf
also `super strong and stiff` but `they can sustain larger reversible ("elastic") deformations than crystalline alloys`?
what do you have to do to cool it that fast
basically metal but make it obsidian
woah
a perfect structure and a good design
which once again shows why perfect single crystals metals would be so amazing
amorphous metals basically have a more perfect structure than metals
and even though the "design" of the structure is worse
the overall package of "perfect" structure and weak design is still stronger than normal metals imperfect structure and good design
amorphous metals have no "defects" or grain boundaries, so no points of stress concertation and hence no failure points
which makes them very strong in comparison to normal metals
but those defects have a very important role of giving the metal ductility, so the lack of them makes amorphous metals super stiff
but with a lack of ductility comes the problem of the yield and failure points being basically the same
it's really interesting, they basically are like half way between a normal metal and a single perfect crystal metal
sounds very similar to the properties of carbon fiber in many way
super strong and stiff, but have basically no ductility and fail suddenly
the really cool thing is the properties basically all line up with what you'd expect if you removed the grain boundaries and dislocations
"Amorphous metals have higher tensile yield strengths and higher elastic strain limits than polycrystalline metal alloys, but their ductilities and fatigue strengths are lower. Amorphous alloys have a variety of potentially useful properties. In particular, they tend to be stronger than crystalline alloys of similar chemical composition, and they can sustain larger reversible ("elastic") deformations than crystalline alloys. Amorphous metals derive their strength directly from their non-crystalline structure, which does not have any of the defects (such as dislocations) that limit the strength of crystalline alloys. One modern amorphous metal, known as Vitreloy, has a tensile strength that is almost twice that of high-grade titanium. However, metallic glasses at room temperature are not ductile and tend to fail suddenly when loaded in tension, which limits the material applicability in reliability-critical applications, as the impending failure is not evident. Therefore, there is considerable interest in producing metal matrix composites consisting of a metallic glass matrix containing dendritic particles or fibers of a ductile crystalline metal."
and it totally changes their properties
they're made by cooling the metal so fast it doesn't have time to form into the crystal structure
well these are metals without a crystal structure
so all the stuff I talked about with metals and their crystal structure
just found out about something called "Amorphous metals"
this is so cool
holy shit
which is of course my own fault
gotta write an essay in far too little time
\
it's that time again
the previous question had a decreasing rate as a positive answer
webassign can go fuck itself
thanks noah
well, the more you know
I do know we're looking for alternatives to silicon
no clue
why sapphires?
modern jet engines also use single crystal turbine blades
"High-purity, semiconductor-grade silicon (only a few parts per million of impurities)"
ah found it
along with a whole clean room and semiconductor lab
here at WSU they actually built a machine to grow perfect sapphire crystals
which will end up making some of the processors defective in some way
but they do contain small defects
they're almost perfect
when they grow silicon crystals for computer chips
we're typing on a "true perfect" crystal right now
in labs possibly, in any "large" scale no
do true perfect single crystals exist
damn that's really cool
if you had a true perfect single crystal part then it would be incredibly strong, as the only way to break it would be to just rip the bonds apart
basically try to make your object out of a single crystal
to keep it short because I'm running out of steam right now
as for single crystal super alloys
such as dislocations running into each other, grain boundaries, and crucially alloyed elements added to the lattice
this is one of the reasons we alloy metals, to make them harder and stronger
pinning points are basically things that stop dislocations from moving
few extra bits
to briefly summarize
-lattices are imperfect
-imperfections allow movement of the lattice
-imperfections can run into each other and stop movement
-imperfections can run into the edge of their grain's boundary and stop movement
-small number of imperfections and large grains equals ductile and soft
-large number of imperfections and small grains equals brittle and hard
-slow cool equals large grains
-fast cool equals small grains
-working the metal break the grains into smaller grains
-we mostly work with the grains size and not the imperfection count (as far as I am aware)
and therefor the strength
by slow/fast cooling (slow equals large grains, fast equals small grains) and working the metal (breaking the grains into smaller grains) you can have very precise control over the grain structure
you can basically either do it while the grains form or after they have formed
controlling the grain size is the easiest
so if you can control the number of dislocations and the size of the grains you can the ductility and hardness (and therefor the strength) of the metal
so to have a metal that has a lot of flex we need a small number of dislocations and a small number of total grains (i.e large grains)
and the dislocations can't jump across these grain boundaries (the point where two lattices meet)
they're lots of little lattices are jumbled up next to each other
metals aren't one giant lattice like we've been talking about them
which is where the concept of grains comes in
so basically you need some dislocations to give the metal flex but not so many that they run into each other
making the material inflexible again
dislocations can run into each other, and when that happens they stop and can't move anymore
but having more dislocations doesn't always make a material have more flex
so basically dislocations are what give a metal its flex
which is much harder than a lattice with dislocations
but the dislocations will eventually work their way out of the lattice until you're left with a perfect lattice
so basically as the material is pushed around these dislocations move, giving the material some level of "flex"
so using the instability of the dislocation you can break the bonds of the atoms around it
(here are some much better photos)
because the lattice "wants to" be perfect
and these dislocations are very unstable and therefor high energy
what we eventually figured out was that the lattices aren't perfectly uniform, they have dislocations (basically holes)
so that basically told us the bonds aren't actually breaking
however we found out that the theoretical bond breaking strength is several thousand times stronger than the actual metal breaking strength
basically the bonds can break and slide past each other and then reform (bending), or the bonds can just be separated permanently (cutting)
and like this for cutting
like this for bending
so we you bend or cut a metal you may assume (and scientists did for a while) that the bonds are physically broken
they look something like this
as I think we're all aware metals are crystal lattices
and how we're taught crystal lattices work is that they are perfectly uniform throughout
let me grab the book off my shelf on this
ok
Sure why not
wanna hear about grain boundarys and single crystal super alloys
Enjoy your motherfucking orbitals
Chem is not
Material Science is fun
This is how I feel about Chem
To go talk to them or not
y
enjo
rip
And no it's not violent, in case anyone was worried
And they're back to yelling
Like I get it's the weekend after Halloween, but go do it at the frat house
Can't people just be a little more quiet
"Neighbors" playing loud music and some girl just screamed
Love you too
:)
here we see the inside of Salina's head
money money money money
Prenup only
No
moneyyyyyyy
the
me
give
:(
No, it's called a prenup
noah what this means is you need to freeze your assets and then pretend to be broke
not just your money
I LOVE YOUUUUU
I'm aware -_-
jkjk
hella ;)
How attractive do you find money?
know any hot surgeons?
Gotta get that trophy wife position
lmao
it is bright
i've seen my future
so like
Our nursing professor said that night shifts were pretty much just making out with surgeons in the stairwell
public health doot doot
so no hoing for me
i'm likely not doing nursing and going full premed
well
<@340319804747415553> <@520095106888630348> care to weigh in
Apparently nurses are basically prostitutes
Fun times in class right now
Thanks IB Music?
I think I already have credit for it
Too busy not knowing how to read notes
Too busy pondering the existence of my major
sure
tons of fun
2 creds
online elementary music theory
anyone wanna take music 119 with me
what
But I'd rather <@340319804747415553> doesn't leave me
I could make a bad joke about that
why is human sexuality under women studies
sex, evolution, human nature huh
i mean
What an amazing idea
Wow I can spend my winter break doing classes
are you okay
!
I'm not even paying attention
my english professor just brought up sheldon cooper in lecture and I'm about to lose my fucking mind
big rip
that is what we call
but I have the lowest priority registration
the schedule I want
I'm so excited for my weekly nap class in 20 minutes
i'm feeling perfectly fine in this balmy 70 degree Fahrenheit weather
na I'm fine
that's a you problem
good luck morning people
and by night I mean 8am
fun times
gonna hit -9C tonight
sigh
it's also really warm and kinda dark in here
unfortunately not
so sleeping isn't an amazing option
it's prob my biggest class
ah
not sure
is my guess
~50-60?
right now
<@&574247915518689281> tea party
class size?
like it's all setup lmao
despite this being modern history since 1900
also we're on like week 8 or something like that and we still haven't really gotten into the actual events of the 20th century
help
I'm in my Long history lecture and I'm SO SLEEPY
Flex on us
Lol
Joke's on y'all my city has free WiFi
My bus doesn‚Äôt have free WiFi, but it sometimes has free seats
nice
We have finally entered the 21st century
My bus has free wifi
Damn
Do y'all ever wonder if they just make random ass majors take calculus because they realize that no one else would take it otherwise?
Or they're just really fucking sadistic idk
Perhaps the writer didn‚Äôt have a very good time in school so they have this second-rate job making online math problems and they want to make others share their suffering
It's just painful
Bruh who tf makes this shit
i'll get whatever the people who write these webassigns are having
Math 124 is clapping my ass harder than any class I've ever taken
Ripperoni
oh wait it's bc ns uw includes chem
okay back to math
this was the problem btw
idk
answers?
validation of what
validation?
also why did i get added to that sheet
that's a rip
gdi
even Jeremy is giving up on you
god dammit math 124
Lmaooooo
big bruh
Bruh
or just rely entirely on blood and forgo the printer ink
You just don't strain yourself and you'll be fine
I've done it
You can lose a pint of blood and be perfectly fine
Lol
You can always find some guy with high blood pressure who‚Äôs willing to donate some
Blood for the blood god
you can cry and just drink more water
but your brain needs blood to think
Your own blood
but making someone cry isn't necessarily a crime
it's a little harder to come by because usually drawing blood is a crime
haven't thought about using blood before
(photo cred to Alan btw)
and they were expected to follow along and write notes
no writing anything down, just talking
Nicholas had a teacher do that once (I think it was a sub and the board failed) and he just straight up started talking the math
<@!478706068223164416> blood is better; it enhances pigmentation
lmao
My math prof explaining a math problem on the midterm no one got by doing hand-wavey magic shit to flex how good he is at math
if you mix your tears with printer ink you'll save money
I guess this is my fault for going into arts/social sciences
it never ends
I'm gonna cry I just got assigned another essay
should I bother
lol I got a notification to renew my fafsa info
instead i'm doing this
i should do my reserach
SLEEP
Thanks. Good luck with your stuff too!
Ima go before Salina kills me
love you good luck on chem my dude
oh lol
I mean, I wasn't ready to sleep until noq
you don't Have to talk to me
Ooferoni
go to SLEEP
a Dumb Nap
But I kinda gotta go
wait I lied I took a nap
Speaking of which, sorry to stop abruptly
Get some rest when you can
Holy shit
I can definitely imagine that. Writing piles up fast.
today I got up at 9 even though I didn't have class till 3:30 and have been working pretty much nonstop from 10 am to midnight
I just don't think I'm quite used to doing so much writing at a time yet either, so when a lot of stuff piles up it's rough
aside from self-imposed bullshit like writing my whole ass history paper in less than 24 hours nothing specific has been overly stressful. yet.
Hopefully you find out soon and your next semester can be a little less stressful
there's a lot Less Stuff that matters which generally I like, actually
I just submitted my first major history assignment and just had my first sociology exam (which I think was my worst midterm so far lol)
I don't really know what most of my grades are like rn tbh
That's a nice cushion
Bless up honestly
right now I think I have like a 98 in poli so that's cushioning me hard
oh avg >80% across all
Also, my dad bod is coming back hard
Like is it you have to average >80%, or if you get a 79% in one class, you're fucked?
wdym?
like I'm definitely hitting that right now, but I'm also currently in classes w a lot of people who don't care about like poli and don't really know what they wanna do yet
And is it for overall classes or a cumulative 80%?
Ok, that's nice at least
Yeetza
nah first two years once I get into upper level stuff I'm p sure it reverts back to Cs get degrees
Is it for your entire time at UBC?
you know so far it feels Not Bad
Damn, good luck
Holy hell, that's pretty insane
it's all %s
also we don't really do the 4 point gpa
keep in mind we have a lot of pretty brutal curves
80% avg
What is it?
.....it's a high benchmark though
I don't like it but I don't hate it, like I have to meet a benchmark is all, it's not like I have to be better than a certain # of people
Yiiiike
like I'm fast-tracked to IR but if I don't keep a competitive % avg I get kicked out
I have to keep at least a 2.5 in STEM classes to stay in engineering
I think some majors do something similar here
for us it's not # of people per major that matters, like idk what to call our system, but to be able to confirm/declare a major you need to maintain a certain grade average
And that, my friends, is how you properly leverage connections
Current plan:
1. Take HCDE 210 at some point to end up in the same room as an HCDE prof
2. At some point in the quarter, randomly stand up in the middle of class and loudly proclaim "AH, YES, I FIND THIS TOPIC VERY INTERESTING. THIS REMINDS OF THE TIME WHEN THE GREAT UX RESEARCHER, SCOTT WANG, WHO HAPPENS TO BE MY BROTHER, WORKED ON THIS ONE RESEARCH PROJECT AT HIS JOB AND ENCOUNTERED A CERTAIN COMMON EXPERIENCE."
3. ???
4. Profit
HCDE took 29 people last year lol
cut me some slack here
i'm competing for a capacity constrained major
man
He gave me an awkward wave and seemed to appreciate it
I fumbled with the door and shit and made semi-loud sounds outside in the hall
Dude was asleep by himself at his laptop in the study room next to me
I did something similar the other day
I gotta interact with people? ok I'll be nice
damn
<@503787499605458954> yes
Now that's capacity-constrained-major thinking, Salina
this library closes in like an hour I wonder if I should wake him up before I leave
Take his laptop
Shank him
Quick
Hope he's ok
Ooferoni
dead asleep
the guy next to me is like
That defeats the purpose
IMPROVISE ADAPT OVERCOME
WORK HARDER
I'M WORKING ON IT
PLS
SLEEP
Thank you so much, guys
lol
Lmao
STOP COMPLAINING I'M DOING EXACTLY WHAT YOU TOLD ME, SALINA
good luck bb you got this!!!
oof
He‚Äôs been stressing bout the chem midterm
ok good
gene go to sleep
I'm brushing my teeth
Cindy tell him to sleep
Rip
Go sleep gdi
I took a really ill-advised nap earlier
Gene
a few hours
in like
Get some rest. You deserve it, Cindy.
I'm proud of you
I'm glad you made it
also the number of fellow sad souls still in the library w me at midnight is honestly depressing
Rip
I can like hear my pulse rn
wow
bro I still barely made it
i agree
shit our support was too powerful
now I need to figure out how to get rid of 2 pages lmao
ok well
why am I like this?????????????????????
I JUST DID SO MUCH MORE WORK THAN I NEEDED TO
it's double spaced
I'm stupid
wait holy fuck
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
be driven by my wish that you fail
lmao
oh well
wrong channel
brb i'm gonna wash my face
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
BETTER THAN AVERAGE BEAM
each 'go' has the potency to last one hour
go go go
aight folks wish me luck I have 3.5 hours to write 3 pages and hopefully still be better than average
I hate myself I have to make another run to the same library tonight bc when I took pics of quotes I didn't get the page numbers
curve
I got a 68% on my CS midterm and that somehow translated to an A
Haha sure
Okay we'll need to video call cuz I'm actually in Gene's hall rn lol
Apparently the vast majority of people take Comp Architecture immediately after and almost no one does software design
I also gained new intelligence
Sure!
<@472541429130854421> you free right now? I found a whiteboard that I can use to explain what program design is about
Just maybe in a more polite way
You could also tell them to shut up
can the library staff kick them out
people who come into the silent study rooms to talk don't deserve rights
It's fascinating stuff
I can show you some cool stuff program design might teach you later
Cya! Thanks for the advice!
oof good luck
Bye!
Well then I‚Äôm gonna take Software design
Ok midterm time
Oh that makes sense
But I recommend Software Design because good lord my personal projects benefitted so much from it
Comp Arch would be more pressing for a comp engr or ee
hello Cindy
Since I‚Äôm set on my major I can ‚Äúexplore‚Äù other classes whenever I want to
Software Design is so important to learn right after Data Structs because it tells you how to use everything you've learned to Do Real Things
So I guess the only way timing matters is if it helps internships
Eventually I will have to take both of these
hi alan
trusty fellow coding friend has been summoned
Software Design by far
My third option is to take neither of these and don‚Äôt do CS next semester
<@!478706068223164416> what‚Äôs your opinion?
Computer Architecture
Pros:
- CS degree requirement
- one smart friend is taking it so easy to ask for help
Cons:
- Idk if I necessarily need to fill out requirements early
- Subject is less relevant than 
Software Design & Implementation
Pros:
- Much more useful, if I have internship this summer maybe I can apply some of it
Cons
- could be a lot of work (20+ hrs per week according to one peeved reviewer) if I have bad teammates

Both these classes are generally heavy/difficult
ÊàëÊ≤°ÊúâËÆ°Âàí
what's the difference between em?
I can‚Äôt decide what CS class to take

Want it to last a while
Honestly college kinda feels like peak autonomy
Exactly
High school felt like it lasted centuries
I mean, there's summers and shit in between there, but yeah. It's only as long as high school was.
This is giving me an existential crisis
Soon I‚Äôll be 1/8 done with college
My semester is more than half over
F
Yike RA
Rip RA
For my RA no
For me yea
I hope it went ok for you at least
Daaaamn
Fun times
Macro average was 12/20
thanks
yeah, this chem reading hella thicc
good luck man
anyways
idk math either
huh
or this week is week 5
should be week 4 yeah?
don't make me do the math lol
idk man
I thought you didn't start class till like sept 20something
whymst the *fuck* do i have a chem reading
that sounds wrong
it's week 5 of 11
it does
wait does your quarter not end in december
OH FUCK I STILL HAVE A CHEM READING
i have a steady diet of webassigns and aleks
idk, i'm halfway through the quarter
things have definitely ramped up in the time since though
well that was me for the first month or so
which honestly kinda concerns me
i feel like i've spent less time both in class and out of class
i can't say i've had the same experience
like hours of work/study per hour of class is definitely higher but I also have less class hours which is super nice
lmao
wanna trade?
it honestly feels really weird to not be taking math-heavy stuff this year
I'm not sure how it compares
I had to think about it a lot
idk I called my parents for the first time in like 2 weeks last night and they asked how my workload was in comparison to HS
just be sure to take care of yourself in the process
but you got this
that sounds like hella work
good luck
daaaammn
poli is the one class that's pretty much effortless for me, this is boutta change big time though, got a 10 page paper that's gonna smack me in the face very soon
but tbh I did really well on the practice before I even read the chapter so I'm not worried about that
well ok I have my next poli midterm on friday
my last in a series of 3 essays is due tuesday night
wang gang
ayy
funny enough, same
hopefully things turn out ok for you as well though
i think i'll be functional after wednesday
I'm really not being productive rn though so that's prob not a great start
here's to hoping this week is less of a mess
‚ù§
love ya too
lol
like, more than i stressed for my ib french exam
i can't stress that enough
again, you're the actual best
thank you, cindy
you got this babe
public to-do list for tomorrow:
-6+ hours of sleep tonight
-2 hours making a rough draft of my design project in the afternoon tomorrow
-math practice exam after dinner
-look through some notes and some chem
-feel guilty about not having done another practice exam but ultimately feel it's stupid to try to wake up early on tuesday to do it
my parents won't send me my sheet music bc they don't wanna pay international shipping :/
aw rip
~~still haven't ordered music to play yet though~~
catch me playing my sax next week at the same hour to exact my revenge
me, drunk on a sunday night
lmfao
wtf
also, im in the study lounge and can hear someone singing at 1AM
you're the best, cindy
ill take a look when i revisit the problem in a second
thank

@gene
cuz that feels like less of a lost cause
i've mainly been studying chem
been wasting time ngl
same
was gonna do it tomorrow
have you done one of the old math midterms yet?
it just means yeah somewhere on the line
doesnt mean literally at the same x-coordinate
so simultaneously
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
like it doesn't have to be exactly the same but if it's a similar problem it can help
something I used to do a lot with webassigns is to just copy/paste the question into google and see if someone has an explanation tbh
<@!173668455856340994> is this webassign whooping your ass as much as it is mine?
like I did the derivatives and got the same answer and that's not helpful
same
I'm starting to think I told you the wrong thing but idr how to math
the other one is super steep positive on the left
dude, i'm fucking hungry
one's like roughly connecting the two verticies
and both positive
think the lines between the curves
tangent to both
i dont even see one
how are there 2 lines
what
what the actual
it'll shaft me either way because math doesn't have feelings and most of my class is actually competent
or don't
wish me luck
thanks
i'm referencing jeremy's cheat sheet like every other problem
oh yikes good luck
tuesday
when is it?
rip me on the midterm i guess
i'm fucking up this webassign so hard lmao
i couldn't see either for a solid sec
it's alright
yes I am
o wait
am I stupid I only see one way for a line to be tangent to both lmao
i'll try to figure out what i did wrong then
thanks
this is so fucking wack lmao
I think
yeah
the right way to go about this is to take the derivatives of the equations and set them up as a system of equations, right?
ok, so correct me if i'm wrong
yes
Did a wild <@261949028994908170> appear?
My default setting is still "alone" so I don't feel like I need to specify time for that. Like the vast majority of my studying exercising just walking around campus is by myself
The milk tea you sent a pic of highkey looked amazing
Bad alan
Alan sober up
cool
oh that's why
Bad
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
why am i muted
come to the voice channel if you wanna hear me talk programming algorithms while tired
tea drunk alan is gonna talk through hard programming questions that could be on the 143x midterm
fine
tea drunk
just tea saturated
I don't get tea drunk
Even Alan gets tea drunk
Damn
lol
after we had tea we went to chinatown and I had a cup of hot milk tea
before we went to dim sum and I had two or three cups of green tea
well that was about half of it
When I was hanging out with y‚Äôall or...?
That‚Äôs all I did today
HEY THOSE WERE SOME STRONG CUPS NEAR THE END
I'm gonna do some cs studying probably
Weak
Wowzah
Also high key I'm extremely tea hung over from the 9ish cups I had today
Nobody's up anyways
Alone time for me is the mornings of weekdays
I just make to-do lists and figure it out as I go I guess
I tend to avoid "allotting time" in the form of a schedule because I know I never follow it
I'm lying down on a bean bag during my study time, so I guess this is a universal experience
I allot alone time for studying but does that mean studying actually happens? ü§î
Y'all ever just need peaceful alone time to recharge but refuse to acknowledge it and instead only allot alone time for studying?
Don't walk in the dark alone, try to stick w your friends and look out for each other
Keep track of your drinks, watch when they get poured, don't accept open drinks from strangers
It's not usually dangerous unless you get stupid drunk
I'm mostly there to dance, maybe play a little beer/other alcoholic substance pong
Some of my friends think the parties are a really gross experience
If you are deeply uncomfortable with being squished among a shit ton of people in a relatively small space, and/or have a Major problem with a lot of people touching you, maybe reconsider
Personally I enjoy them but it's not for everyone
Go if you wanna go
and
this is the same essay that includes the section
remember how I kept complaining about english
guys
If you don't drink, I don't think it'd be dangerous. It's still best to bring a friend either way.
If you're drinking, you're right that it'd be best to be a friend.

Do you want to go? You're not obligated to go just because you got invited. I've been invited to a couple and have just been too lazy to leave my dorm lmao.
do you guys think it would be dangerous?
However I do not plan to get drunk
The main concern is I don‚Äôt have a friend with me
Considering I‚Äôve never been to one I don‚Äôt have an opinion yet
well do you like frat parties or not?
Do I go or not
Someone invited me to a frat party
I'd be bored if I had the just to lectures on theses in college too
I mean, it's totally valid to be upset
I need to stop complaining about her lmao this class is just an L
like I'm not sure if it's helpful to others
I can't tell if I'm just being annoying bc I did ib and have heard all of this so many times before but big surprise my history TA's lecture on thesis statements is pissing me off
üò≠
i'll pass
k thx
wanna join? respond now

<@&574247915518689281> dinner
yes
more money more priority
an app that auto registers you, but users have to bid for the first spot in line
better yet
would creating an app like notify uw except it automatically registers you and charging $20 for it be unethical
the closest identity I have is `1/cosx = secx`
I can't figure out where it comes from
from 7sin... + 7cos... = 7sec...
can someone explain this last simplification step
Rip rip
she's taking 5 classes
granted
tbh she seems to be less on top of things than I'm used to seeing her
Not even close
I'm not as on top of things as Ramya
though I have a friend who's out on the 4th
like the same week, idk about days
Ramya told me yours are the same time as mine
Daaaamn
Ours are the week before I think
potential last day for us is like the 18th
Idk lmao
is it?
Damn, that's kinda late, isn't it?
my last final is dec 13
I got my exam schedule
oh hey
I haven't heard of having to do that
I'm just gonna choose to forget if nobody says anything
I'm scheduled for tomorrow but I think literally everyone forgot they were supposed to happen
has anyone had their one on one meeting with the RA
still are
yes
<@478706068223164416> i thought we were getting dinner today?
I would love to get food
wanna get food
Me!
anyone out of class rn
come on in
answer will never be no
O shit can I go too
Guest list so far includes Lord Byron, Saint Jeremy, and Good Neighbor Nathan
Friday evening, 6 or 7ish
In an unrelated note, I'm planning more tea time
The extremists would lose their minds
you ever wonder what would happen if it was suddenly known that God supported homosexuality?
"The homosexuals will parade their depraved sexuality to try to ease their conscience with God"
Sign found in my hall
Ooof
‚ÄúHi I‚Äôm Alan ‚Äú
Want me to go for you
L
I have classes between 1 and 4:20 tomorrow
for context, the hiring fair runs from 12 to 5, but it's only open to non-Allen school students (me) from 2:30 to 5
bc fuck ENGR 101
and be late to ENGR 101
guess I'll just skip cs to give myself an hour at the fair
fml
can't skip math bc that's recorded attendance
I don't wanna skip my cs quiz section bc I have friends there
I can't skip ENGR 101 because I already got fucked for missing a pop quiz bc I left early last time
when literally EVERYONE HAS CLASS
hiring fairs always right in the middle of the day
are
why
they're great
idk what started the asian don't use dishwasher thing
yeah it's a lot more convenient
and warm
when the plates come out they're sooooo clean
idk I find them really satisfying
damn rip
on belts and stuff
but those were like, industrial dishwashers
lol the only time I've ever used a dishwasher was at work
good plan
then I leave its broken body behind and fuck back off to canada I guess
but what if it's broken again
give the poor thing a purpose in life
go for it girl
yknow what it needs to actually be used I'm doing it
lol
it's tragic
they still never use it
ok ours was broken when we bought the house 12 years ago (previous owners were also asian.............) and after years of pressure from me & sister parents finally got it fixed like 2 years ago
so not much changed
it was serving as a drawer anyways
what the fuck
and replaced with it drawers
my parents actually just REMOVED our dishwasher
okay but related note
hey I have to struggle with it too
racial fucking discrimination much?
wow
but you're asian
normally no
is it an unacceptable level of lazy to use the dishwasher for that
I used 2 pans and like 3-4 plates
ok I love cooking but I hate cleanup
it was a rhetorical answer
it was a rhetorical question smh
we were born a year earlier is why
why is everyone like a year older than me tf
‚ù§
thanks, math hw took all of my arithmetic energy
but it's ok bc we love you anyways
YOUNG AND DUMB
you're dumb
WE'RE STILL YOUNG FOR NOW

You're in college tho
I want them to GO TO COLLEGE

Well, I'm glad they have someone to go to
Interesting

Your kiddos are clearly more proactive
I extended the offer to a ton of folks, and no one took me up on it lmao

Update: chillin in the lobby
It's a good tree
I'll be outside Elm looking at the tree
lmao np

I was gonna suggest we go to belle square over the weekend
lmao
I'm down

anyone down?
<@&574247915518689281> you guys sick of local point yet because I kinda wanna hit up the Korean place behind Poplar
rip
People walk so slowly I'm gonna scream
rip
lol
also know has HBO/10
my roommate is counting the number of times people have sex in the show
often both
I don't think a single part of the show hasn't been about one or the other
living up to the name
solid
ok the show so far is literally only drugs and sex
but idk
it sounds like drugs
ok I've heard a lot of people talking about it and strangely seen a lot of euphoria makeup tutorials but I have no idea what it's about
very HBO
it's an "interesting" show
My roommate has started to watch Euphoria
on an unrelated note
I don't have class till 3:30
I might pass out semi soon? idk I'm in a productive mood for some reason
was gonna yell at you to sleep but honestly you're fine
oh ok good
12:00pm
when's your class tomorrow
much nicer and less consequences
lmao
ICE Canadian edition
instead they have a whole thing where there are always people around checking students and kicking people out
I assume you could break it pretty easily
I kinda want to look into how robust the system is
and they can just give your card access to wherever
idk it's kinda dumb bc the card is what matters for actually checking things out
they just have scanners on all the doors that need special access
that would make more sense
our access is just linked to our card
really?
no, but I have to show a person whenever I go in
I'm p sure I have to pay money to replace them
are they like barcodes?
the stickers are valuable bc they designate status for some of the special programs I'm in and give me access to restricted library sections
it's amazing
LaTeX
though literally every equation typing software that I've ever tried is absolute trash
I submit all my work as a pdf at this point
word's equation editor is the worst
and they want you to use word's equation editor
what
I don't have word
what if you get marked down for not using an equation writer
check my parentheses yourself bitch
fuck you, I'm not gonna use an equation writer then
sqrt((((0.127-0.126)^2)+((0.125-0.126)^2)+((0.124-0.126)^2))/(3-1))
this is how I spite them
also fuck
stickers that are valuable?
but that was really trippy bc apparently there was a lost twin floating around somewhere for reasons unknown
anyways the one I had until yesterday had stickers on it n shit that were also valuable so I still need to get my shit together and figure out where I lost it bc I'm 90% sure it's actually somewhere in my room
they did actually email me saying they'd found my lost student card weeks ago but I emailed back saying they prob notified the wrong person because I still had mine at the time??
plot twist: they had A Student Card with my name and number on it, but it was labeled found in mid-september
so i got to the front desk and they're like we prob don't have it otherwise we'd have emailed
I briefly mentioned somewhere here earlier that I couldn't find my student card
bro some weird shit happened today
lol honestly same
so my natural state
which are due tomorrow
Mark went to bed and I'm doing Chem labs
rip
he's still asleep on the floor
I'm not sure why it feels weird
oh I just saw thisi
So I guess he's sleeping here tonight
We don't want to wake him
Mason has passed out on our floor
<@!503787499605458954> why?
jkjk
lol
<@!460689096646590465>

it's been very strange seeing all the insta posts from girls joining sororities
I knocked on both doors and nobody came to any
:(
lol but where yall
:((((((((
<@340319804747415553>
You didn‚Äôt ping me!
I knocked on your door
I‚Äôm not good enough???
Aw
<@520095106888630348> <@258094439636008971> I'm at Elm rn you guys wanna meet up
So like 25th to 75th percentile
Ohhhh that makes sense
the range is from 3.93 to 4
it was the range
okay hold on I got it wrong
I‚Äôd have been below average then lmao
Is that statistics from last year, or what‚Äôs going to take effect in the future?
??????
to 4.0
from 3.93
they told me the CS direct admit average gpa rose
a couple of my senior kids at Skyline said UW had an event
stacked stacked stacked stacked
Facebook seems pretty open to Freshmen applicants and the lady at T Mobile said I'm pretty stacked for a freshman candidate
wow fance
Talked to Facebook and T Mobile
Just got done at the expo
I went to the Engineering Hiring Expo at UW, and it was way more legit than I thought it was. There was a booth where they were looking for PhD students for full-time jobs, and I really I was super underqualified to even be in that room lmao.
I ran into lIke 5 guys where I did a double take and was like is that him
Saint Nicholas has a hella generic face
But anyway
Oh it didn‚Äôt send
Is that your observation?
hella random observation
also
jkjk ily noahhh
if i find a hotter and richer guy who's willing to spoil me....woooo we are in trouble ;)
mmh
‚ÄúProb‚Äù
i prob won't dump him
it's a strategic move hun
:D
Looool
who would i leech joy out of

<@340319804747415553> dump him
That's exciting
‚â•.‚â§
=.=
No keep going, I'm close
sorry sorry i'll stop
in jarrett?
being in something huh
I do remember being IN something though
I don't really remember
Weren't you INTP <@233062637922025472>
I‚Äôm ENTJ (probably) though irl I‚Äôm more introverted
I don't see him as Fi dom or Fe inf
*because of functions
We thought Jiayi was ENTP
I'm more I
Between E and I
Jiayi's a switch
maybe jarrett's into dealing w two dicks
good question noah
This was a while ago
he's def not e
Why <@233062637922025472>?
Which is within margin of error
I can‚Äôt remember but I think we decided on ENFP
then <@!233062637922025472>
I'm around 90% of each letter of infp
if we're gonna talk about pegging
Lol I was about to point out the word choice too
*pegged*
<@!472541429130854421> did we ever type jarrett? apparently the test pegged him as infp
*flaming
Noah: "Shitty dps"

keirsey's variation is the 4 temperaments
I'm bored in english rn so I'll go take an online one lol
wait, 50/50 of what
but if I had to guess it's 50/50
booo
didn't tell me
alan what was your keirsey result
today is my shortest long day this week but I had to get up early so I'm cranky and tired
Heh
you're not wrong
This is sounding like an mbti test
easy-going-determination
Haha
fuck
Well said by the INFJ
but I guess at the end of the day I value warm-heartedness more
I try my best to be so
it's not impossible to be both cool-headed and warm-hearted
They also don‚Äôt have ‚Äúneither‚Äù
idk why but srue
yeah
A personality test?
"both"
there's no option here for
we're taking a survey for my cs class
That just about sums it up
then don't bother showing up
unless you know them already
data structures are fun
solid
So basically yes
Data structures and algorithms
is it basic programming?
No one is paying attention
lmao good stuff
At CS rn actually
Wish I did that for our career fair
Though half because I'm skipping cs to go to a hiring expo
I'm wearing like 5 layers right now
Our low is 52 rn
Whoa is it that cold in Seattle already?
yeah finally haha
*low 2 degrees c*
It‚Äôs finally below 80 degrees! uwu
owo
Yes
math is boring, can you tell
meeshegan
yoobeecee
uwu
dook
I have only one class today at 3 pm
thanks
great
alan, i love you
lollllll
Hahaha
LMAO
Kenneth was dying on the inside
and they didn't say a thing
and I sprayed our fake plants with some water
Ken brought over some people I haven't met before
guys I did it
clickbait emails
lmao
smh
students who *wish* to terminate
Omg that subject line
they need to not make that the subject
BRO THIS EMAIL STRAIGHT UP GAVE ME A HEART ATTACK
what did you guys do this time? lmao
our room needs to open an armchair psychologist office lmao
shits it out again
eats that
shits food out
the printer is like a doggo
move to iceland
win several thousands of dollars
lmao
file a complaint and sue the school
and if he doesn't call on you at all the entire year
just keep raising your hand
ah okay
which might be because I didn't take HL history
it's a prereq for IR classes but I also chose world history since 1900, which I'm very personally interested in and feel like is an area that got kinda neglected in HS
both
are you taking history because you like history or because you had to take it?
not because I'm bad at it but because I strongly dislike my TA and my prof appears to either dislike or just not notice me
I kinda get the sense that history is inevitably gonna be my worst grade this semester if not this year
yes
have you tried introducing yourself after class or something
idk
maybe he thinks you're gonna make him look dumb
lol
maybe he's scared of you
and I don't think it's what you've suggested bc today he called on one of my friends twice in one class
which is really unfortunate
I think I've talked like twice total in his class
he just either constantly overlooks or refuses to call on me and has since the beginning
I get it when it's like that when it's like you already talked a lot so I'll let other people talk
no but like
or something
"alan I appreciate the enthusiasm but I gotta make sure everyone else is learning this stuff too"
it could be for the same reason that I used to not get called on in cs class
my history prof never calls on me and idk why üò¢
oh well it was gonna happen eventually
ok but not a good one lmao
this is another milestone in your college career
c o n g r a t u l a t i o n s
Oof
Fuck I overslept for the first time today
ooooh
it's not showing up for me for some reason rip
https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.26.3.3
<@!503787499605458954> another thing for you
Hopefully it works out soon
Oh, ooferoni. Sorry, idk how to help then
nurs
If it's chem, I can lend you my laptop for a bit
Which textbook?
Ooferoni
._.
my online textbook is doing a big dumb
big fan of the pearl river mushroom dark
that's my #2
Big disagree
this is my personal fave
you can find it in anything from fried rice to soups
golden mountain soy sauce is literally the signature soy sauce in my family's home cooking
and uh, picture for the uninitiated
I think I have light soy somewhere here
yeah I see your point tho
on this hill I stand
I will die by golden mountain soy sauce
no
try subbing a lower sodium soy
ends up too sugary
I personally don't recommend adding teriyaki
Ooo that sounds really good too!
so it might go there
I bought some curry mix but I don't have plans on making curry
next time it might be curry fried rice
I'm sure next time will be even better
It sounds promising tbh
Well, I appreciate your efforts to experiment
it's a little salty
to make it more dinnery instead of breakfasty I might try adding teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce
Good notes
Interesting
it's a very *heavy* dish
the veggies add a hint of sweetness, with good contrast against the bacon
Yeah, it sounds like one now that you mention it
this kinda tastes like a morning fried rice
stronk
the bacon that I bought from district market is pretty strong
Mac and cheese rice edition?
(the kind of food you can just spoon gob after gob into your mouth)
so far the cheddar makes the rice stick together a lot more, making it easier t oeat
Let us know how it goes
cheddar part is experimental
it's bacon/veggie/cheddar fried rice
Oooo looks good!!
Update: Fried Rice is done
Nice!!
Update: am now cooking fried rice
alright I'll be making my way around west campus, send me a dm if you wanna meet me somewhere
i dragged jane to chipotle
thought so
I already ate. Sorry :/
but in any case, wanna come?
it's dark
alright correction
Don't hold it too hard against yourself. Like Helen said, 7:40 is hardly late.
7:40 pm is hardly late, my friends are out playing tennis in the dark rn

Good luck!! You got this!

and I was like woah there
he started comparing the nuremburg trials post-WWII and the executions of prominent nazis to tracking down and murdering oil company CEOs
no it's funny bc you're right
you don't need to like him as a person, just as long as he has a nice face it's fine
_am i wrong_
LMAO
sounds like one night stand material tbh
...well that's less cute
also there's a cute guy in my class but he just started Seriously ranting about killing the rich
whatever I like all my other teachers and TAs, there had to be one
im sorry cindy
well thats shitty
yeah
So she's really vocal about that huh
Ah wait just "a professor"
Don't the professors choose their TAs?
but the other half is super uncomfortable
it's weird bc I can tell that other people in the class really like her
oh yike
sorry for bitching to everyone lmao
I'm annoyed that I got up early for this
ok we're halfway into the class and we still haven't started talking content
she's like the epitome of the "Triggered SJW" stereotype
but her attitude irritates me to no end
like she seems nice and she cares
yikes
in the space of the first 10 mins today she accused her AI of being racist and a prof of being transphobic, made excuses for herself for not getting things done (like a billion references to being a grad student), complained about being from the US, and idk just generally she has a way of "teaching" that really gets on my nerves i.e. she's really condescending about note-taking "has anyone tried not copying from the powerpoint yet" etc
why?
bruh I feel bad about this bc she seems like a genuinely well-intentioned person but my GOD my history TA makes me wanna rip my hair out
wow creeper
Might just be a personal thing tho
Idk, there's just a lot of people in Ode a lot of the time
it aint bad
alright well
Gross
That requires going up stairs
bottom floor is kinda bad yea
it's good if you go up to the top floor
And also a really mediocre study spot imo
Odegaard is so far away
you can come take a shot
booo
lmao no
Take a creeper shot
wild elbert, nathan, and alan spotted at odegaard
Yike?
I am getting enough sleep I'm just also highkey addicted to the nectar of the gods
Less caffeine, more sleep
C I N D Y
That doesn't sound good
thank you mother nature for creating the coffee plant
HELEN, SLEEEEP
I may need to fix this soon lol
I‚Äôve been sleeping less than 7 hrs consistently
I'm good lol
I passed out at 3 and slept till noon
SLEEP
Cindy,  S L E E P
time to crash I think
my caffeine-fueled cram-mode haze is starting to wear off
The 4k is wasted here sadly
Watching "Stalker" (1979)
‚ù§
if you run low on good vibes just say the word and I'll send them over
keep on rockin
solid
and I'd rather stay up late and crash till tomorrow afternoon
I need to study
I have my first midterm in 2 days
what happened to that
hold on weren't you supposed to be sleeping
good
which is also my goal
I can definitely tell you do it to because whenever I read your texts in your voice it sounds like you're speaking to me
yeah same
I'm taking a breath or pausing for a small moment
every line break
imagine that at like
yeah but I usually use line breaks as a means of making my words seem more like how I would actually say them
lol the longer my texts are to you the more angry I am
and this is me
relevant
this
like
talk
also, I read somewhere that some people get annoyed when people
but no bodily harm was to fall upon us
we were in danger of getting lost
wait I take that back
we were walking around at like 11 AM in the depths of tokyo and not once did I feel like I was in any danger
it was like that in Japan
yeah I miss the feeling of basically never feeling in danger
the arteries of those who endanger you or your friends
but my point is I basically never feel unsafe here
boxes, packages, plastic wrapping
no yeah I do
you can open things with them
knives are great
if it helps you can carry a knife
look you get it
uhh
less...
so my standards for sketch are a less...
then again I am a guy
I walk around in the middle of the night here with basically 0 concern all the time
yikes
someone who lives right next to it
speaking as
the ave is as sketchy as it gets
still wouldnt go into any unlit areas though
I'd say that the campus campus is pretty safe
how safe is the UW campus
Everything work out ok?
Maybe they just don't know what you look like
I would call again, even if it's just to check the status
But that's so awkward lmao
I could call again
Is there no way to make additional comments or cancel the request?
If they show up and I'm not here that's sketch too
Well no
Do you want me to grab Salina or something and we can come get you?
Uhhhh yike
That's kinda weird though
Just it dark out
Uh, maybe give it another 5-10 minutes?
I think suzzallo is still open tho
Odegaard
Wait, nvm
If I'd left when I called I'd be back at the dorms by now
Odegaard or Suzzallo?
I'm just standing alone in front of the library on my own
10 minutes
Have they been slow or something?
How long have you been waiting for?
How long do you think I should wait for husky nightwalk to come get me
Young fry of treachery
I'm so happy she made a "what, you egg!" joke
I FOUND ANOTHER SHAKESPEARE NERD
And why is there just random stuff in them now
And why no locks
It's like they're containment boxes for hazardous "things", but why wooden insides to the doors?
And there's rubber isolation on the doors as well
And the door is really thick with a giant embedded steel plate
At least it's not the other way around
They're solid concrete boxes with random stuff in them
Wack?
They're all unlocked with no way to lock them
What the fuck are these
No, Jarrett
<@173668455856340994> and did you not want an actual sheep for a body pillow?
Glad you figured it out though
Oh, sorry, I just saw this
nvm ken gave me the answer we're good
I don't have to factor that ugly thing do I
please I'm so close
Bruh that looks like an actual sheep
<@173668455856340994>
Almost done tearing my room apart and then reassembling it
Amazingly there isn't a standard laid out for it

Some engineering building is always on fire
Alan, eat real food or I'm dragging you with me to the food trucks in red square (which are amazing for something that somehow takes meal plan credit)
please
eat
...yall
Hey, at least you won‚Äôt get scurvy
Just ate for the first time today
Ah, I feel you
(if you're feeling bad for me don't because the reason I forgot to eat lunch was because I was having afternoon tea and snacks with my neighbor)
he Fucks Up
on today's episode of Alan Does the Living Thing
cuz I'm really not about to eat until 6 or 7 at this rate
I really hope one of my quiz sections lets out early so I can go grab something to eat
catch me surviving on pocky and oranges
ooooof
FML
AND THE FACEBOOK PANEL IS AT 4:30 TO 6
I gotta find me a snickers bar or something smh
I have back to back classes until 4:30
go eat
it's not too late
and breakfast was only an asian pear
also I legit forgot to eat lunch today
yeah you're not a boy-band fangirl that's very clear
(also you can see me start to switch up the order of my words on accident because I've been doing too much japanese practice)
ok personally I really dislike a lot of kpop-y hairdos so there's that
yikes x2
but aside from can dance you described at least 10,000 asian guys named Kevin
lol
yikes
so a koreaboo
can dance
lean build
dark hair
all good
yeah idk my linebreaks look weird bc i' calling noah and doing hw at the same time
ok
ah
1st line was about being single
lol
it was 2 messages
read it as 2 separate things
"i mean honestly i really enjoy it someday"?
i'm just saying it doesn't grammatically make sense
NOW I'm confused
wait how is it not
i will roast u in quiplash tho
not everything is a roast
mhm
oh lol
`i mean honestly if i really enjoy it someday... i will actually let someone ask me on a date`
I get how you're trying to roast me
yeah how does adding an if make sense grammatically
reread pls?
`I mean honestly I really enjoy it
someday.... `
wait what
OOOF
i think you dropped an if
someday.... I will actually let someone ask me on a date
I mean honestly I really enjoy it
imma chill over here
riprip
Gang gang
hell yeah babe
Did someone say perpetually single? üëÄ
anyways it just seems like I don't bc I'm perpetually single
like these are the people I'm often drawn to friendship-wise too
well no not necessarily in a romantic way
wow look at the real guy magnet right here
I meet people who are My Type pretty regularly
also to answer your first question
Lol
sass specifically isn't required but it's a big plus. good sense of humor is a must though, could be like dry and deadpan, could be super sarcastic, could be really dark, anything goes
They‚Äôre usually interesting but content of conversation is much more important than how they say it to me
Actually sassy is ‚Äúeh‚Äù to me
rip
I like those kinds of people but generally they don‚Äôt like me
personality-wise, 100% people who are bold, adventurous, and sassy
GENERALLY I have a thing for dark hair? and I like guys with a certain build, like lean but not huge. also guys who can dance is a BIG yes. but that's about all I can think of there. like race doesn't matter, can't think of specific face features either
What kind of personality?
tbh I don't have much of a physical "ideal" type, even though I'm not really romantically inclined I'm a lot more attracted to people with a certain personality type
like he wasn't ugly, other people might be
it's a nice way of saying I wasn't attracted to him personally
And what is your type then
Doesn't answer the question
When will you find someone who is your type üò´
not my type
LMAO
Was he hot?
I like ghosted him in person and I still feel really bad about it bc he genuinely seemed like a cool guy
ok random story time: I met a guy at a music festival who seemed really nice, he was like checking on me and friends and random dudes when we got shoved around in mosh pits. I'm like 80% sure he was into me though like kept finding me and talking to me in particular and I felt suuuuper awkward so I just disappeared into the other side of the crowd
Lmao no
"The other half are trying to ask me out"
Wait thats false, not everyone is straight
Half of them are currently in relationships
All the guys in my group are straight
I can think of 2 and I'm not super close with either
Huh
Wow
Damn
No straight male friends here
Ok y'all just made me realize that I have like
Yes
Are you guys implying that there are heathens out there trying to have premarital sex?
Out of my current friend group which has 4 girls including me and 7 guys, one girl has had ‚Äúno romantic feelings whatsoever‚Äù, one seems prudish but is actually a closet perv and two are pessimistic about their romantic prospects
Huh
I‚Äôve seen girls point out hot guys they see randomly to their friends
Really???
I have never seen that happen but I‚Äôm not surprised either
I don't think that's weird at all
Some girls make it an explicit goal to seek out male attention and talk about it w friends
That they do that, and share it among friends I guess
That guys make it an explicit goal to seek out female attention?
Not too surprising, just interesting
Wait you find that idea surprising?
One day I overheard a guy say to his friends ‚ÄúDo you guys know any girls yet‚Äù in a completely serious way
I'm not sure if that's a joke or not
Apparently many guys in college make it an explicit goal to seek out female attention which I find pretty funny
what fun
man
LMAO
And now he's just talking with some girls in the class
oh _yike_
Day drinking already?
Oooooooof
My lab partner just showed up drunk
I know that you took them
I think that's a compliment?
But like if you just met me, I don't think you'd be able to tell if they were stock photos or not
All my friends and anyone who's seen my insta can probably recognize a few
lol
So I'm gonna try to find a way to kind of imply that I did
ah
I was thinking people weren't bringing up the photos as conversation pieces because they didn't realize I was the one who took all of them
Yeah that's what I thought
but like if I knew you liked hiking and also just went to japan I could infer
You literally walked in and saw me for the first time
in that case I'd probably assume stock photos
do I know nothing about you at all
well if I were a stranger then idk
but if you were a stranger and walked in, what would your first guess be?
ok I didn't Know, I haven't even seen them up close I just assumed
okay fair, Cindy has seen enough of my photos to tell they're in my style
me
how many of you knew that the photos on my wall were all taken by me
okay so I wanna know
Thanks
So a square root over the whole thing
x squared plus y squared equals r squared
YOU'RE RIGHT
you forgot to square both sides in your process
<@!478706068223164416> do you know why this is wrong?

Lmao sure thing <@340319804747415553>
I thought it was fine lmao
come to me if you ever want rice
<@&574247915518689281>
The asshat eats straight rice, and Liam said it was bleh
jonathan suggested it right?
why don't we go to the cafe on the ave?
I'm not entirely sure yet. I'm kinda improvising at the moment. I heard there's a good Thai place though. There's udon and ramen if we want that. I'm open to suggestions really.
Somewhere on the Ave maybe?
where were y'all going?
ooh dinner
sure
Do we still wanna get dinner together?
sure
I propose 7
what time works
absolutely
he's visiting too
Yea can I bring Cole?
oh nice

<@&574247915518689281> anyone feelin down for tea this evening?
wow maths
<@472541429130854421> that's awesome!! Congrats!
<@193229269076279298> big oof
Our chem average was 68, fun times
Nice
oh wow congrats
Yay I got a 90 on my math midterm! 80 was average üòÅ
Stop
does that make it a sig fig
if you have a fig in SIG
I mean, our prof hasn't even finished the lesson on it yet
Rude but true Salina
but honestly it's a little embarrassing how long it's taking me to scrub off all this rust
math is stupid and i hate it
don't pull a <@!173668455856340994>
haha
drop it
I can do it
math 124 is asking me to find the tangent lines to circles
I don't even know what math is anymore
I think it went pretty well! It reminds me of the tests we had in IB math
At least have the decency to have puppies
If you're going to try and get us to go into your van so you can kidnap us
Lies
Hey, kids! Multivariable Calculus is fun
how'd it go
yaaaay
First midterm, in the bag üòÅ
^
somehow this is unsettling
I haven't been to all my classes yet and Helen is already taking her first midterm
Good luck
Multivariable calculus
My first midterm is today
It's cool
I was gonna walk around a bit and take a break for lunch
i was gonna do it later
oh
Meet in front of Elm?
I'm about to head out right now
i def need to do that
When are you guys?
I'm planning on doing that a little later today too
I was gonna check out where all my classes are
<@&574247915518689281> anyone wanna join me on a walk around campus?
My roommates wake up at 7:30 anyways lmao
I accounted for that
but then I remembered
I remembered that class is starting in a few days and I got sad that I'll have to actually wake up
Alan just needs to prove he actually has friends
cool
And me
they told us to bring friends
Gene, Salina and Jodi say sure
it's a hall event
<@&574247915518689281> pancakes at 10 in Poplar
It really does look like one tbh
Lmaooo
Which I guess isn't too far off the mark
My parents have started referring to it as my apartment
It's like a really sleek office
Damn, that's crazy
Your dorm looks so cool! I didn‚Äôt recognize it as a dorm at first
It looks modernist
Man
We still gotta get dimmable led smart lights to complete the evening atmosphere
I think the daylight shot illustrates the comfy better than the night shot right now
Although I suggest you watch (https://youtu.be/U1dMlVwUsrA) as it covers some great information on how our eyes change light perception over the day
And it seems for these lights that's 4500k
However their is obviously an optimum color temperature if all your looking for is lumens
I would assume from the description that the color temperature and dimming are separate settings then
*Lighting during the day will come from sunlight, and lighting at night will be in the 3000-4000K range. The room‚Äôs preinstalled light sources will not be used (without modification). This is to keep the room intentionally dim, as to promote the room‚Äôs feeling of warmth and comfiness even into the long hours of the night. If more light is needed, desk lamps in the 4000-5000K range are acceptable, so long as such sources do not overpower the existing lights. No fluorescent lighting.*
my spec from the dorm planning doc
"They can be adjusted to as 'white' as daylight bulbs (6500¬∫K) or as 'yellow' as early morning sunrise (2700¬∫K). But they're brightest at about 4500¬∫K which is a little warmer than most daylight bulbs. In terms of overall brightness, they're equivalent to a 60W incandescent bulb."
https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-460989-Compatible-Assistant/dp/B01F6T4R80
for instance
not of smart LED bulbs
I'm pretty sure the color temperature is a constant
why does nobody list the color temperature of their lightbulbs at all the various dimming settings
(the room is currently lit by nothing but my remote controlled candles)
if you wanted to know what's behind my dorm decorating, it's happening right now as I very intensely browse dimmable LED lights on bestbuy's website at midnight
i got lemon and ginger tea which supposedly helps more but i don't have test data to prove it
any kind of tea or even just hot water helps
hot tea did help my sore throat especially in the mornings
UW overenrolled and didn't expand dorms fast enough
We're making it work alright
What's up with all the triples
Oof
Yeah
Gene do you have three people in your dorm?
azn power
Cuz we all let out a sigh of relief and yeeted our shoes away at once
Highkey, we all peaked when we agreed on a no shoes rule
nah you good lol
Ohhh I dumb
she was also in cap marvel
I'm gonna be honest, I'm really bad at both actor and character names
also astrid is way more interesting that the main character whose name I forgot
god she's so attractive what the fuck
tbh gemma chan is the star of the show for me
ahhhhhhh
Crazy Rich Asians
what movie
i love you
Yeah lmao
ahahahahahaha
"Lmao, yeah, I stay up til 3-5 p regularly"
"Damn. Dude, that guy's pecs. And his biceps. Oh damn." (Shirtless scene in movie)
"You know what would be the power play here? Walking up to that group smoking pot with this popsicle stick and just casually joining in on the conversation."
"I will say, this carnival is definitely more spacious than a frat party."
"Uh, so, someone needs to bring this up, but if anyone needs to have a guest, that's chill. If you guys need privacy, text us and let us know in advance."
I've made some awkward allusions that sounds weird out of context
how
??
Tea, but I'm 90% sure my roommates think I'm the sus one out of the group
Except for the one corner where everyone was openly smoking pot lmao
The atmosphere was neat
It was a bunch of various booths with some loud, mediocrely remixed music
Eh?
It was
<@!258094439636008971> how was the carnival thing
w
actually though I'm done bitching for no
kidding, ily
exercise your right to shut the fuck up
neither
Do you want my support or my condescend attitude as someone with an autoimmune disease
don't feel bad that wasn't the goal I was KIDDING
Take care :(
Awww
but yeah thanks guys
like what if I don't lmao
`hope you get better` is so ominous
I meant like
Feel better soon
then I'll bring your ashes to my dorm and we'll have a tea ceremony
Awww, Cindy
what if I just die
yeah me too
yup, hope you get better
thanks though
that's unfortunate
Like, even makes me grimace, and I've been drinking day long steep tea for years
ah
Plus the stuff that would help a sore throat tastes super bitter
Lemonade's acidity helps soothe a sore throat though and that's much easier to find
lol but in all seriousness, only medicinal tea can really help with a sore throat
what
lemonade
also do you have any tea recommendations for a killer sore throat
I'll bring out my best stock
abso fucking lutely
oct 12 or 13
mark your calendar
can I actually
that looks so good
what the fuck
come have tea sometime
Dude woah
aw that's wholesome
And they watched a stand-up act
My roommate was apparently there. They weren't on anything. Just Smash
LOL I love that
Like actually
Smash bros
what was that
oh yeah jane also said one of them went to whatever was going on last night
Yike
My roommate said "apparently our floor is the fun floor"
most of said friends live in a different building
I live on the 3rd
I study w friends in non-antisocial hours in the 12th floor lounge all the time
fair enough
lol
Damn, apparently they're not even on our floor. They're just here
should prob have mentioned that too
Apparently it's mostly international students, but I'm just heading from my roommate
we're not allowed to have open alcohol in lounges
Yeah, but these people are like in the dorm
that was also the night like 3 people got alcohol poisoning bc kids are dumbasses
then again I got invited to a party my first night here so I guess that's not that weird
Apparently they're fairly wasted
huh ok then
First day for most people here
Yeah
is your building mostly freshmen or nah
My roommate went to a small lounge to play CAH, and a group of 15 or something was drinking vodka apparently
already? damn
Apparently half the floor I drinking in the lounge right now
ok I had to like force my parents to leave the next day
aww
But I don't mind lol
I got mildly helicopter parented
My mom just would not leave lmao
how was moving in
that's good to hear
They're p chill though
Ripperoni
asking bc jane called them kpop people
Yeah
are they both asian?
But it's hilarious
I'm not sure how long we're gonna keep this up
lmao
They're both convinced that Jane and I are twins
you're not aggressive
ALSO
also, you talk loud and fast but I don't feel like you steamroller people in conversation
damn go off
We went on a three-way politics rant for 45 minutes earlier today
Tea, but they both talk faster and louder than me. It's weird that I'm the one getting steamrolled over in the conversation.
My roommates are pretty cool
Day one of UW has been  b u s y
Y I K E
tell me about your first day at UW
anyways enough about me
I like the subject way more though so I'll deal
same "y'all are addicted to your phones" spiel
she's my only prof who bans laptops
it's the worst
WHEN SHE TALKS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY
ALSO
but idk I just get similar vibes like she'll interject with things that are sometimes annoying but sometimes inappropriately hilarious
like remember when we were watching the 3 identical twins documentary and maners made like a subtle sex joke idr what it was
This is cursed and blessed at the same time
also just her sense of humor
N O O O O
I was dying inside
like specifically brought up The Theory of Knowledge/epistemology as a discipline. and then rambled about Kuhn for like 10 mins
Oh no
This prof
Oh wait
first of all, this is the prof that said like 5 billion tok trigger words in one lecture
Wait how does she remind you of Maners?
i can't quite decide if I like her which was the exact same feeling I got all of tok
my soci prof also reminds me of maners and it freaks me out a lil sometimes
I love that
Omg
Literally all my classes are boring except Mechanics of Materials
and we "unpack" a lot of complicated readings in class
Does she refer to the class as "friends" when getting people's attention?
like when there's a new complicated word or lit device or something that pops up she'll write it on the board and then define it for the class. today it was polyvocality
they lecture in a similar style idk how to explain it properly
How so?
Dude that's like amazing
the prof is awesome though. she kinda reminds me of south african matheny
Fair enough. Housing is only so diverse
like theoretically it's cool but. as I'm p sure I've complained about here already, housing studies are incredibly boring
Rip lol
tbh it's still my least interesting class
Oh damn, that's really cool
my global arts studies class is about conceptualizing home and like analyzing refugee crises around the world and talking about racism/segregation/alienation a lot
Lol
this is so meta
yeah I refer to my room/building as home here all the time
I already referred to my dorm as home
Ripperoni
where is Home
this is strange
wow, I was gonna say something about possibly coming home the night before, but home as in vancouver
Np
thanks hun
If you need any stuff though, I have spare pillows and whatnot
No lmao
oh I thought you meant they weren't chill with *gasp* A Girl! staying the night
The other has no context as to what I'm asking about
I don't care I'm just curious
One of my roommates is out of the room right now
what objections do they have
Lmao ok
why would that be more complicated lol
<@258094439636008971> back off she's staying with us
DESIGNER JIAYI
designer jiayi
I asked one of my roommates, and my room would have a lot more hurdles to jump through if you wanted to stay here
What's the original jiayi? Target Jiayi?
I need to meet Walmart jiayi
They can share a bed like old times
Stay with Jarrett and Walmart Jiayi
we'll see I'm still tryna schedule shit
oh I don't mind sleeping on the floor in the slightest
They look like kpop idols
Off band kpop roommate?
Jodi and Salina are fine with it but we don't have an extra bed
also now that y'all are back how was move-in/the carnival
so chances are I'm just gonna leave monday night
on the other hand I don't wanna be annoying and wake anyone up at 6 am by accident
We found out that one of them was part of the party last night
ok I'm wondering if I should leave monday or tuesday, bc I don't have class tuesday till 3:30 pm (and attendance isn't strict if I'm not feeling it at all), but I would have to leave at like 7 am tuesday and I don't wanna bus to the city from sammaish at 6 am
lol?
Him and his off brand kpop roommates
Oh yeah Gene's right across the hall
I could check with my roommates too if need be
I'd have to ask but I doubt Salina would object, just need Jodi's ok
Uhh probably?
We're back
<@&574247915518689281> I know y'all are busy right now but I just wanna ask, if I were to visit the weekend of Oct 11-14 would it be ok if I stayed over at one of your dorms the night before I leave (Monday night)
Alright, omw
Not Jane
Kane
Come meet us by Jane
Where should I meet you guys?
Yes
<@258094439636008971> <@520095106888630348> <@340319804747415553> are you guys at the carnival?
This is how you measure material properties
Professional engineering
Well, alright, I'll take your word for it lol.
i can take a video of my room if you want but you're probably fine
yeah nah you good
Really?
You're totally fine
Lol
<@&574247915518689281> does someone have a pic of their room I could use for reference? I wanna know how much I overshot
My roommates are gonna be pissed
That moment when you realize you just made a huge mistake
I mean, if you feel that's the best route, I definitely think that's more than doable
I'm in full impress-profs-charm-TAs mode, I'm always like this at the beginning of the school year, nitpick and tryhard everything so I can slack off later with less consequences
nah
I mean, if you feel more prepared to write about the other one and it's not super important, might as well
i can come up with something for this too
but
the other one I have more specific things to say about rn
The other is still somewhat interesting
That's hella interesting
trying to decide what to write about
yeah that's what I thought
psychological constraints on freedom
what's more interesting, the flaws of the economic theory of democracy (assumes votes are like a bell curve on the political scale) or the psychological constraints on freedom
nvm
book
Try to sleep. If it doesn't work, just started reading.
if my roommate is coming at 8:30 tomorrow morning then should i try to sleep or read a book
If I try to sleep it might take me shorter or longer depending on if i fall asleep right away or not (if i don't fall asleep quickly then i might stress myself out)
if i read a book then i might lose track of time but it'll relax me more and might fall asleep faster
Yeah, I don't blame you
yeah i'm not going to pepper spray some guys on my floor
The other option was pepper spray, but same problems
Precisely why I didn't bother to list them
and krav was too long ago to make me confident that i could hold my own
i mean i'd rather avoid a fight on my first day here
I could list a few things, but they all involve harming strangers (granted, in completely feasible manners)
there's not really anything about me that is particularly intimidating or commanding of respect to/from strange men
I don't know what they're doing or what they're on or how many there are and I'd rather not face that by myself in pjs
I don't blame you. Loud, potentially high college guys late at night are yike
tbh i'm also a lil afraid
Honestly, there's a non-zero chance those guys are all just in their underwear and that's what they're finding so funny
can pants are a pain
so yes
me and my roommate are mostly transitioning to that
so go out in my underwear is what you're saying
I go down and do my laundry with no shirt on
you're gonna be living there, assert dominance
why? I got out of the shower and changed into my pjs
weak
`I'm in pajamas`
I'm sorry you have to put up with that though
That's fair enough
no i don't think so
Not up or downstairs, right?
I don't want to go out and see who it is because I'm in pajamas and I don't trust my ability to shut up a gaggle of college boys
they're in the hall somewhere
Are the monkeys next door?
Ooferoni
dunno where the RA is then
RA probably
i don't know who's in charge of coming to shut them up though
i guess?
no they talk too deep to be girls
Also, aren't dorms supposed to have quiet hours after a certain hour?
Could they just be girls
maybe they're high
they have like surprisingly high giggles
No rickroll
Let me know which one lmao
they're still out there
blast it by the fuckboy room
Find out which room it is and I'll blast September at 12:01 tomorrow night outside their door
Jkjkjkjkjk
... and not through walls ;)?
No i'm good lmao
I don't think I'd be able to hear sex through the walls
I feel like it'd be roughly the same as bringing a boyfriend, they'd just have to fuck not at night/a night that the roommates are out
If not, my mom's being insistent that I bring a few pairs, so you can have them if you want tomorrow
<@520095106888630348> do you have foam earplugs?
bad idea?
so I mean I doubt that'll happen
Bad idea
I agree
i mean no, it's not that important
if you're sharing a room with 2 other people I feel like it's a Very Bad Idea
Want me to ask?
she doesn't seem like the type to bring people home but I just realized that I didn't know
No idea
yea
is that your third person
<@!340319804747415553> do you know if Jodi's single?
but headphones would be annoying
I fall asleep with earbuds in sometimes
ah well I sleep later than basically anyone else on my floor
i'm not sleeping in headphones tho, that's uncomfortable
my roommate and I get along super well, generally, but we're very different people and I do NOT think she'd be chill w that
always gonna leaning on them for their place?
why?
but also I would never bring someone home lmao
like good for them. I'd just slap my headphones back on
tbh I don't think I'd care
lot's of different opinions on it on quora
Wtf
https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-write-out-moaning-sounds
had to look this up
*mmmmh ohh yea aah aah*
i think i'd cry if someone said that
Wow
*did you put a condom on*
*wrong hole idiot*
oh god
*loud moaning commences through the walls*
or i'd keep it to myself bc that'd be uh
one way of getting acquainted with the neighbors
if they were fucking i'd probably just say that lmao
party
like party "OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH"?
or I have someone in my bed *OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH*?
they just let out a long "OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH"
we have fuckboy neighbors
i think
it's coming from the hall
no they're in the dorm building
Always noise outside at night
Yay Seattle
GET OFF MEH LAWN, TEENAGERS
there are some KIDS outside making a RUCKUS
when are your finals
damn you had midterms already??
And I must sleep
But I'm dead tired now
It's been a good few weeks
First round of midterms is over, got 100lbs of aluminum, and have half a 3d printed wheel
<@&532798023483523102> <@478706068223164416> <@105508293522264064> 
I talked to cw today and have some updates for y'all.
-He mailed out IB diplomas three days ago and said they might take a few days to get to us (I just checked my mailbox and I found mine had just been delivered today). I'd phone someone at home to get the mail for you.
-He mailed out IB certificates for you CP folks yesterday, and they should be arriving in a few days as well.
-He hit me with a wink wink nudge nudge that there's an IB graduate circle on LinkedIn of some sort. I think cw himself is related to it in some way and it's all of his IB kiddos, cuz he said "I'm just a portal." The way he said it made it sound like he wasn't supposed to tell us but that it was really good for connections. I advise y'all look into it (he said two people from our class have found it, the rest haven't). I'm gonna get LinkedIn tonight and see what happens.
Cool, thanks
They have you load your stuff into a big cart and they help you move it into the elevator and into your room
Cart
Valid
I just wanna know since I have a lot of stuff
I thought there are supposed to be carts
a cart, dolly, anything?
<@520095106888630348> did they give you anything to help you move with
Nice picture!
<@478706068223164416> definitely
I didn't audition but my friend got in!
There's a Kpop dance group here it's pretty new
Let's do it
Nah it's more like they're willing to stay a little longer to make sure I'm not completely alone for dinner
(unless you're looking for a way out of hanging out with them)
But I don't want to take you away from your parents
I wouldnt mind
my parents wanted to know if I'd be free for dinner, but I wanted to see if anyone was looking for company
also <@&574247915518689281> that's moving in today, and are we gonna have dinner together
nice
I'm thinking of joining a dance club but I already joined so many and I kinda wanna get a job so ???
I do wanna actually learn tho
I don't actually mind going alone
Lol it's good
Aww, I'm sorry, Cindy
I'm trying to get someone to come to dance classes w me here
I would 100% go with if I was around :(
yes there's a kpop seession
Is there a K-Pop session
Yes, I definitely remember how to square dance
But it's better than nothing I guess
Unfortunate
The square dancing unit was cursed
Never again
From like square dancing in middle school
Lies. You have dancing experience
This is really flattering
Damn, I should definitely go to these if they're specifically catering to me
I mean if it's all skill levels like you probably gotta cater to the least skilled
but lyrical is apparently intermediate, but says all skill levels
all of them say all skill levels
I am most definitely not all skill levels. Just the beginner one.
I think some of those other ones arent
I think swing dancing was for all skill levels
Yeah exactly
Meet someone new
You can go rando
Oh lol
like i said, rando
yeah i know
i kinda wanna go to the hip hop and lyrical workshops
They said you can show up without one
but you can also pick up some other rando
you need a partner prob
But I've been thinking about one of the swing dancing classes depending if I ha e time or not. Idk how those work though.
rip
I'm dying lmao
Like, within the same second
I was watching Spongebob as you were saying that, and I got the notification for your message just after the line "Next I suppose you'll want me to go square dancing with Patrick"
<@&574247915518689281> anyone wanna come do some of the dance workshops with me during dawg daze
but that's since been cut off
originally she bleached the top part and temporarily dyed it dark blue
the mustache comp is pretty spot on though
just without the beard
kind of looked like this
it was really cool ngl
she had short hair
it was shaved on the sides and longer on the top
That‚Äôs kinda the point here
not quite shaved
Yes
call me cynical, but part of me believes that he probably wanted you to get the haircut so he could rub in to shannon how yours was better or something, so i think it was smart not to
Shaved side
What was this controversial haircut?
Ah
two years younger
yes
I don't ever get haircuts do it's not like I took him up on it
Is Shannon your sister?
I don't remember
what ended up happening from that?
that's really fucking low
just to be petty he once offered to treat me to a haircut because "I trust that you won't be like Shannon"
especially the fact that it's superficial enough that seeing one other person doing it suddenly makes it ok
that's stupid though
damn, but shannon's haircut was/is (idk i guess both tenses work) really amazing
it's also absolutely appearance
My dad had absolutely lost his shit when SHannon cut her hair short a few years back and like constantly refused to pay for her haircuts because "If I don't like it why should I pay for it" and a few days ago Shannon told me that he recently became ok with it because one of his female coworkers got a similiar haircut
as someone who has thing perpetually bother them even when they're present and not normally anywhere near as serious, it's best to just talk about things. even if other people have nothing much to add, they'll be listening and acknowledging what you're going through, and that's kinda what matters. but you guys sit through enough of my bullshit that i'm willing to listen to whatever y'all have to say.
honestly, it's probably important to if anything
If you have something to say, it‚Äôs fine to say it
It‚Äôs mostly fine
Shrug
i'm sorry Salina
And I feel like I‚Äôm not contributing on it either
i've lost my shit about it so many times that i think even cole's gotten tired of listening to me because it's the same every time, he's just to nice to say it
I don‚Äôt have the energy for this anymore
no that's totally fine
I just won‚Äôt sit in every time sorry
^
If you feel the need to talk about it, then talk about it
I feel like I bitch about it too much tbh
sigh
it's alright, cindy
ok tbh I'm trying to talk about it less but I'm also like I've been having a crisis about my family relationships these past few months
alright, i get that. at the end of the day, there's only so much that can be said on one subject. don't worry about it.
I feel like I repeat my points from before
I know you guys like to talk about it but I‚Äôm kind of done with complaining about it on my end
I‚Äôm not uncomfortable
valid. love ya, ttyl
that's completely understandable. sorry to make you uncomfortable.
Talk to y‚Äôall later
Tbh I think I‚Äôm gonna tap out of this convo
oooof
and while my family seems to understand the problem with the asian dick measuring contests and other harmful aspects of asian parent culture, they (my brother included) are just really numb about it. at one point in time, my family started joking i should tell my friend's parents about something i did (i forget what it was). their specific reasoning was something along the lines of "it'll trigger certain insecurities in their parents, and then they'll proceed to make their child miserable as a result. from a third-party perspective, it'll be hilarious to watch." i immediately slammed on the brakes and proceeded to explain that that was all sorts of fucked up (with nicer language cuz i still can't swear around them).
^
my mom has major self-esteem issues and I think a lot of when she lashes out at me is her projecting said issues onto me
like tbh I think both my parents but ESPECIALLY my mom are neurotic in their own right, they just don't see it or admit it
so. overcompensating for perceived failure in their own lives
there was this book or post going around on SAT that was titled something like "My Parents Expect Me to Take Care of Them When They're Older and I Don't Know What to Do"
idk if it would even be a joke. I know my parents are like this because they feel they haven't been successful in their own careers/gave that up to move here and are now putting everything on us
cuz i see family friends do it
i was always relatively removed from certain aspects of asian parent culture cuz my parents learned from their mistakes after some thorough discussions with my brother (thanks, scott), but asian dick measurement contests are just really weird
Gotta make up for the actual Asian dick
Sorry sorry
There‚Äôs a joke to be made here about overcompensating
the universality of these experiences is super depressing
It feels like everyone out there knows I want to be a doctor bc my mom keeps fucking talking about it
in some asian dick-measuring contest
and brag about your kids accomplishments
Man
as soon as there are other people around, you pretend to be a good happy family^tm
^
it doesn't matter if your kid is falling apart mentally or if you constantly berate and insult them in private
Lol
But bitch I see your bank account
My parents joke about the retirement thing a lot
Do not recommend
As someone who has wiped old people ass
also, appearances are everything
...
You have kids to grow up and make money so they wipe your ass when you get too old to do it
The world doesn't need more people with high productivity, it needs more people that are passionate
^often yeah
having children isn't like a fulfilling thing for them though. It's a retirement plan
That's not super helpful though
just also usually with a lot of hidden mental health problems
Lol
So that's something to look forward to
the sad thing is that it "works" a lot of the time in producing hardworking and high-performing kids
my dad swears in chinese a lot and reamed me out for repeating it once when i was younger and didn't understand what it meant
Well you'll all be off at college soon
My dad is p receptive to talking about it but my mom just flips the blame on me
Asian parent culture wooo...
But yeah
Your mom is adorable and usually awesome and I love her
Then proceeds to apologize for it
But my mom curses like a sailor when she drops something
Parents still get mad at me for swearing
It was a fun time
I got threatened to be disowned over saying welcome home bitch to my sister
not the time
Lol
Jokes to be made there <@340319804747415553>
Nice
so that's pretty much how it goes
not gonna say much more as to not steal anyone's thunder, but my mom told me yesterday that she's gonna start swearing in front of me "because I'm old enough now"
it never worked on me either in terms of actual Discipline
Pain tolerance is nice
I think my parents would have been more keen to spank me if it actually worked
they got beat up as kids too and they turned out ok, so by their logic it's ok
there's this saying in china that's like "good people come from the stick"
What a fun combo
in general we get along
my dad's second-gen and my mom's a genocide refugee
that it was traumatizing and that I alternately was terrified of/absolutely hated my parents for like 5-10 years
And I'm saying it's irrelevant
she literally could barely grasp that it's led to so many mental issues for me
I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs common
I've sat down and had conversations with my mom about what was basically the physical abuse of my early childhood
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs good noah
like
but like I don't think she Actually Means Ill, despite how much said things have fucked me in the head
Do you think if we killed 12 million instead of 6 million Jews it flips back around and becomes good?
it's an extremely flawed viewpoint
but I know that's what she believes will shock or scare me into maybe dressing "less like a whore" and NOT get raped in the future
She uh tried to get me to never buy leggings again bc of it
Oh that makes it so much better
My mom says it a ton
I don't AGREE with that, I don't think it's right or ok by any means
A lot of Asian parents say that actually
YEAH HERE'S THE THING
Yeah I can‚Äôt say that about my mom
`she was basically like have fun getting raped in the future`
Man
I genuinely believe that they want the best for me
here's the thing
Mental still counts as abusive
But my mom is fairly emotionally abusive
I have no idea how intentional their actions are
is it abuse if it isn't intentional?
I appreciate my dad a lot because he tends to be more reasonable on  topics that aren‚Äôt gaming/mental health
I still don't know if I can properly qualify it as abuse
dysfunctional, for sure, for me
Wooooo
I‚Äôve been gaslit to high hell
because on some level I do care about my parents because they raised me like idk how I'm supposed to feel
but it's really hard to separate
To be blunt all of you seem to have abusive and disfunction family lives
like in an ideal world I would love to "not care about family" and only "care about people"
People are flawed but some people are flawed in p fucked up ways
What a fun fun time
For a long time I thought the only thing I had over Susan was being pretty
so like I don't really care if they seem like decent people to normal viewers because they like
aren't
It‚Äôs kinda weird
My mom comments on my appearance a lot
And if you happen to be my family, well ok
Well yike
and it's because "we're family so we can do that"
I care about people
Like my mom will point out every pimple and all the imperfections she can see in me
My dad constantly calls my mom fat and stupid
That's my personal stance
I don't care about family
Because my parents as parents they have a lot of responsibilities that they need to fulfill regardless of anything else
Yup
big part of asian culture
that too
^^
I don't think that works
My parents believe it's ok to say/do things to people that are your family because they're family
like from an outside perspective I think the way they've treated me and my sister is pretty fucked
yeah well the thing is if they were just another asian couple I would 100% judge them for borderline child abuse
I try to separate my parents as parents from my parents as people
see, I try to think of it that way, but i still don't know the answer
I've personally always thought of it this way
If my parents weren't my parents, just normal people
Would I like them
Granted she‚Äôs going through a tough time of her own but like wow chill maybe
misery loves company I guess
yikes!
She also got really mad at me for being happy and watching funny videos yesterday so rip that
I have a really difficult time reconciling how they are as people in the outside world with how they've raised and treated me and their questionable/extreme conservative political views
She blames me for most, if not all, of the family‚Äôs problems
I like my dad but my relationship with my mom is chickenshit
at this point I have no idea if I like my parents or not
... lmao
Must be all the tea they ~~smoke~~ drink
I think his dad is second gen though
alan's family are all p cool from what I've heard
That's how I transported all 3 of mine
Put as top item in the stack
I said I‚Äôd rebox the whole thing and he‚Äôs like nahhhh I got this
wrap it in your blanket because you have to bring that anyway
Wrap in towels
Take it off the stand
yike
Ah
My dad says he‚Äôll drive over and deliver it to me bc he‚Äôs concerned that since it‚Äôs like kinda hurried the monitor might get damaged or something
when i got bruising on my jaw from wisdom teeth surgery and i mentioned that a teacher had noticed my mom made jokes about her and my dad beating me up
gushers don't exactly serve as deodorant, but i guess someone creative enough could make it work
Just buy a small bag of them, they're pretty cheap
that would be funny
and my parents are only funny to themselves
i read that as deodorant and got confused why she gave you tide pods
Why are you leaving stuff behind <@340319804747415553>?
yeah i had to ask my mom for detergent nigh on five times and when she FINALLY gave me detergent she went and handed me five tide pods
Bring it
Wait why not the monitor?
Ah I've always personally subscribed to the I'm never gonna see these people again and even if I did I don't know them so idc what they think, when it comes to making scenes in public
This philosophy was a creation of Nicholas of when 3 brothers are acting like 3 brothers trying to entertain themselves in public, basically lots of horsing around
The fridge tho... man
I‚Äôm not bringing my monitor in the kerfuffle
And I‚Äôm def leaving some stuff behind for later
My mom has been having a hissy fit of her own over here
Big rip
Man
Cole likes his parents
Am I actually the only person in this group that actually likes their parents?
Alan, Jiayi, Gene, and David are the ones idk about?
Wait no Jarrett's parents are cool
and they DIDNT FUCKIN TELL ME that they were planning this until we were in the middle of buying it and told me in front of store employees so i couldn't yell at them
they tried to make plans for me to move the mini fridge to my dorm this weekend instead of during actual move in day
like "you don't need that yet, leave it at home for now and come back and get it later"
my parents have been legit trying to get me to leave stuff behind
Like what does this mean?
?
`more stuff for you to do`
well. you'll be gone soon. hang in there love
HES A FUCKING CHILD
more parent-problems
?
I'm lost
relate
oof
i'm just done with this whiny bitch ass kid
But golf karts are more fun
Golf is fun
At least you can go play golf that way :p
I'd rather spend the day with fucking Trump
if you wanted me to come back and visit then maybe you should've like
actually been a good person
L
like bitch
i was paying tuition and my dad was like "huh. I should've left more stuff for you to do here so you'd come back to visit more often"
How come?
pissed off
fucking
i'm so
Big unit
Quite a few of them as a matter of fact
An absolute unit
It‚Äôs a big boi
My chem textbook got here
Scroll down cuz the login stuff is kinda hidden away
hfs website
where do we go to pay for housing?
I meant 2 months late as in I left in august
canadian thanksgiving
probably the weekend of oct 11-14
oh
what's in november?
wait, when are you visiting again?
biggest mood
- us in 2 months
"HI SO GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN HERE'S YOUR GOODBYE CARD"
so you're just gonna get them like 2 months late lmao
I made you and noah lil goodbye gift cards but I forgot to mail/give to other people to give to you
ok highkey
‚ù§
I'll put it with your fridge magnet then
there will be a $12 shipping fee with that
lol
I will take it
honestly I'm broke as fuck
i thought you were offering me a pen
so act quick!
but uh, it's going down
$4.06
isn't that like $4 usd
anyone want my spare 438 yen
Honestly, my plan is kinda to wake up each day with a loose idea of what I wanna do, see what else there is that day, and then tag along with some folks to some events.
Really? Damn, I must've missed the memo lol
and some are RSVP only
like i don't think i'm doing the Seattle Aquarium one because I tihnk they're full already
they are
The fact that there are five (six?) swing dancing sessions makes me believe they might be capacity constrained
That too
they prob only have space for a certain number of people at each
Because they want you to feel like you have a lot of things to choose from
and lmao alan
because a GOOD number of events didn't make it on to my list because they overlap
i'm confused as to why they have so many overlapping events
A lot of those seem really lit though
Oh my gosh, that's a lot of events
I've been too focused on just living stuff
I almost forgot to pack actual school supplies
I'm packing stuff right now
nice
ayyy i'm 1:30-2:30
3:30
I move in tomorrow
I move in on the 19th
also is anyone coming on the 19th?
in case you didn't
http://www.uwdawgdaze.com/new-all-events/
did you find it?
i was only looking at key events
oh wait
wait where did you find the list of all the activities
i also sorta wanted to do a swing dance class but don't have time
i know some things are at the same time but i figure either do whatever is more interesting to me or leave partway through/come late

Oh, fair enough
I'm required to take phys for CompE, point was I didn't need to take Chem
Fair enough. Feel free to share once you're done.
I'm not done yet
I have a very loose list at the moment, but I'm mainly figuring it out as I go
Spill the tea
I made a list
But yeah, I'd love to go to pretty much any of the events. The vast majority of them seem like a fun time. If any of y'all wanna go to an event, hit me up.
Also <@478706068223164416> you still gotta take *a* science class for HCDE. It doesn't matter what it is. The only reason I'm taking chem is cuz I kinda need a small break from bio (as much as I enjoy it more).
I was already planning on going to a lot of the things you guys mentioned lol
They have carts for you
I was trying to figure out if I need to bring a forklift to move all this stuff
oh nvm
thats my roomate
A cart or basket perhaps
oh im at home
<@173668455856340994> did they give you like a dolly or something to help you move stuff
Hahaha good call
i did end up choosing the right
very smart
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
The bed is not in the way of the door
fung shuiily speaking
whats the difference between the sides
Feng Shui?
But you're probably done already
<@173668455856340994> I'd choose right for better Feng shui
don't think it's weird to go alone
I've been going to tons of events by myself
sure sure
but no i want to meditate and be enlightened or whatever
because I really want to go to a lot but I don't think I'd have enough friends to drag with me
also do you guys know if it'd be weird to do these events alone
DO YOU GUYS WANT TO GO TO THE LATE NIGHT CARNIVAL WITH ME
<@&574247915518689281> tea party
Alternatively we could just have tea in my dorm room but I'm not sure if we'd be done setting up by then
who can we drag along with us
Let's do it
<@!478706068223164416> i'd only go with friends, it's not the sort of thing i'd go to by myself so if you really want to then i'd go with you
right if you don't
left if you like sunlight (my personal choice)
What side should I choose?
@here
LET'S GO
Y E S
<@!478706068223164416>
rip ~$230
had to test for it
ap ib creds didn't even get me into 124
yeah it was the opposite for me
rip $30
and then got ap/ib credit and jumped 2 classes
i took the math placement
well chem placement was free
damn
so guess who's not getting a pair of goggles and took the chem placement for nothing
neither require chem or bio
I figured out pretty recently that for both CompE and HCDE
also i find it funny how this is a thing
PUPPIES
***PUPPIES??!!***
i think they have zumba other days too
PUPPIES
hear me out
or...
archery and technical dance
let's go bitch
*wait*
i would joke zumba but i move in on friday
sure which one
<@&574247915518689281> DO YOU GUYS WANT TO GO TO AN EVENT DURING DAWG DAZE TOGETHER
yikes?
....
And we don't talk about the cost
16hrs per piece
Got 1/4 of my full scale wheel printed
Haggett I think?
They‚Äôre also redoing the hexagon dorm
Rip
I think I actually know where you're talking about
And land in Seattle is expensive and hard to get
construction i think is underway right now
they're building another dorm building
UW is in Seattle
They have basically infinite room to expand
It's not like there's anything else around us to get in the way
Need more *something*, just build it
This is one nice thing about WSU being in the middle of nowhere
UW's population is insane
Some freshmen can't get dorms
I think
yup
UW has that much of a population problem?
a lot of UW kids have triples
I thought doubles were like the college standardm?
Wait what are you in?
Every time I question if you have enough room, I remember that you're in a double and get jealous
Still
lol rip
They're only like three inches tall, the picture makes it seem a lot better than it actually is
my house lol
Is that picture from your dorm or the store?
Whoa that's so fancy
TEA JANE, TEA
spices?
packing only the essentials
it didn't work
yes
it won't work
i dont care how cool your matching heelys are
remember the gold jackets?
scrubs
HAH
cole and i showed up to school one time in matching choir sweatshirts
we looked like a couple on vacation
dont
no but he really likes the idea lol
with optimal camber
oh my goodness do you actually get matched clothing?
find one with car tires instead of small wheels
that may be too true
.... yikes
find matching pairs
you dont
gene how are we gonna get noah to buy Salina some heelys
well
night folks
goonoo
g'night
anyway i'm gonna go to sleep
that's how it be
eh?
whomst the fuck
yeah
... not great
yike really?
reinsch was
we were told reinsch was great last year
no
should i attempt some schedule-changing shenanigans to get different profs?
*yup*
...
in my stolen light up heelys
a revolutionary martyred for their beliefs
wandering the land aimlessly searching for a shred of compassion
i am but a banished and lonely exile
and i get nothing but rejection and condemnation
i'm trying to hELP YOU
thats mean
and then i'd just be losing money there
take that lame third grader who plays pokemon on the weekends
you have light up shoes that have wheels
i'd be so cool you'd klepto them off me
jane
think of how belatedly COOL you could be
lmao wow
https://heelys.com/premium-1-lo-he100262
YOU CAN EVEN BE GLOWY
https://heelys.com/adults#/attrFilters=15m!#-!126523!-#!&pageSize=24&orderBy=0&pageNumber=1
but i'm too poor for it
prob
do they make adult sized heelys?
we can paint it blue if you want
make the live action movie that was meant to be
on wheels attached to your shoes!!!
be the sonic
i'm just gonna need to *go fast*
lol
HEELYS FALL 2019
vote for heelys
i for one
that is fucking far
damn
:(
nooooooOOOOO
you could be a COOL KID FROM THE EARLY 2000S
janeeeeee
get HEELYS
i guess yeah
lol
you'll get your steps in?
that's fair
but uh
he didn't say you weren't allowed to complain
gene i think i reserve the right to complain about this shit
youre in a fig section
i'm in Loew Hall for English
no
are we in the same class?
that's so wack
really?
oof daaaaamn
it's off campus technically
i think the marine sci building is universally acknowledged as out of the way
*yes*
just curious
...
is it that far out of your way?
i'm STILL salty bout it
fucking marine sci building
...
they hid where my english class was until it filled
man
i wonder why
they hid the math profs so we wouldn't know who we'd get
still not great
that's
5
is this out of 10?
ratemyprofessors
?
well this is promising
which is kind of problematic but I also don't know if i'm sticking with this path so i figure it's not _too_ bad?
i like don't have a good idea of what I need to take
but that's a sub for stats not calc
you can take qsci
who? Me?
can't you take another natural studies or whatever they call it class?
mnop
...yike
L
the ap exam wouldn't have covered my stats req so lol
but whatever
i'm more than happy to be twiddling my thumbs NOT IN CALC
i think i have to take a math class tho because I didn't take HL math
i have to take stats again
grats
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
ALREADY TOOK STATS
i'm home free for math  folks
even for med reqs
i only need stats
*who needs math*
IM SO HAPPY
IM NOT TAKIN MATH
math profs
it's fine
it worked out. Maners was real happy with my participation by the end of the year
hahaha
<@&574247915518689281> to whomstever this may concern, math profs have been released
and that's what we call an oofs
oh yikes. I'm sorry jane
again, i'm glad it worked out eventually, but that sound really difficult
awww i'm really sorry
i had to make like a conscious effort to force myself to speak
made me cry one time and want to cry other times
although you did get p good at it
i'm sorry
speaking in class every day/multiples times a day made me VERY anxious in the start of class
wdym?
that may be because I was like constantly jacked on adrenaline in the beginning of the year
it was a pretty memorable class
i feel like I remember a lot from TOK
i remember comments you made that you don't remember making
i feel like it'd be more of a tok thing
i hardly remember anything from IB psych
things IB psych didn't teach me
the name for misremembering things like this
what?
yeah, that's it
Mandela effect
it's a big mood
I feel like Biden now
there's a name for this, but it's slipping my mind
what the fuck
you're right
wait
wasn't this the 90s?
around that time?
I mean I was, I just was fooled by tabloids I saw while shopping with my mom around that time lmao. I don't really follow any celebrities so I'm not surprised
a lot of people thought that, so I mean, you weren't totally incorrect
"Anti-depressants and traces of an anti-psychotic in his blood may have worsened Paul's inebriation.[2][3] No evidence was found that paparazzi were near the car when it crashed."
ok so i didn't remember correctly lmao
"Media blamed the erratic behaviour of paparazzi following the car. A French investigation in 1999 found that Paul, who lost control of the vehicle at high speed while intoxicated and under the effects of prescription drugs, was solely responsible for the crash."
and like the paparazzi kinda killed Princess Diana if I remember correctly
i think she got them back or something
it wasn't
that can't be legal
paparazzi like snuck into her house while she was sunbathing or something 
it was kinda yike
like personally would not give a single shit in that situation
that's yike
Kate Middleton I think had a ton of topless photo of her taken without her knowing
I don't think I'd mind if I was mind-bogglingly rich
oh yea
tbh, idk how anyone can live like that though. like, rip privacy
from what i remember
lowkey a nazi supporter
so yeah they shouldn't be doing that by birth
from the sounds of it, his brother was even more incompetent
I mean the only reason he was put into that position was bc his brother fucked off "For Love"
they're just classy Kardashians
I mean that just sounds like the Kardashians
i dunno
watching the King's Speech made me think damn they really shouldn't be doing this by birth huh. Like lucky that he ended up doing really well but if he had been incompetent the British really might've screwed themselves huh
me neither
I can't imagine caring enough to follow their lives
but also, they're rich and famous purely by nature of the family they were born into
I kinda get it, there's a shit ton of history there, and it's interesting to see how these medieval concepts of royalty mesh with modern life
people have a weird fascination w them
but like the press n shit they generate boosts tourism
Ahhh i mistook Selena for you
well you don't go to see the People themselves
CA CAW, BALD EAGLES
you mean the royal family are glorified zoo animals???
Oh
wait the royal family is good for TOURISM?
we were not
Did she? Were we even in the same class, Jarrett?
national spirit
tourism
Jane didn't matheny do a whole like 20 minute segment on why the Royal family is good for Britain
I guess it's not actually that different from being say bill gates's daughter
honestly the idea of being born into royalty in this day and age is still kinda mind-boggling
lmao
she's like the US's bald eagle
technically
i get that most of their money is inherited but still
Figurehead but still
is she?
i guess it's kinda a cultural/historical thing, but it is still kinda yike on the surface
She's the head of state
I don't really get it either though
it really is
is that an American way of thinking
i'm still a lil confused as to why the queen is there. Why are British people content to pay taxes to people who don't do shit and are rich as fuck already
which, ew, but still, politically he has way more power
like I'd give "leader of the UK" to boris johnson
I wouldn't really consider her a foreign leader anymore though
we all collectively lost our shit when her grandson got married to an American wow
...I don't know how I forgot the fuckin QUEEN OF ENGLAND
Honestly the most well known foreign leader to Americans is probably the Queen of England
china scares me more day after day
sorry mom and dad
China's kinda a hellhole
tl;dr china's wack
Americans know him
the DALAI LAMA
well that's awful
oof
oh yike. My family is Hui I don't know why I don't know that
Tibet is still heavily oppressed. The Dalai Lama is still in exile dude
<@!520095106888630348> rip i guess
and I know his election got a ton of press coverage but I'd still put him at like 7th on the list of world leaders americans would know
That's a non-tolerant move right there
Remember when he invaded Tibet?
as a footnote 4th reason: french election was 2017, which was shortly after terror attacks in france, which made the world pay more attention to france to begin with
but that sounds familiar
granted, he was still mao
and i concur with jane
i mean, the fact that he got that much coverage at all is kinda the point
was he? I remember like a teeny bit about Mao being relatively religiously tolerant to suit his purposes from HL history
3. his opponent was fucking insane
2. he has a lot of personal life tea (see: his wife)
1. he's relatively young and attractive
also macron's election got way more press coverage than expected for 3 reasons:
I mean he's the one who forced the whole country to give up religious beliefs
I feel like that's false jane but idk for sure
they've been doing that for a while. it just got brought to public attention in the us relatively recently
if i remember correctly even Mao was fairly kind to them
i mean they weren't always forcing muslims into concentration camps
when were they not
becaus China's been fuckin crazy lately
macron was heavily involved during the g7 summit and his election got way more press coverage than i'd ever expect
and I'm not disagreeing on the china bad thing I'm just saying I've seen xi's name way more than macron's lately
no one cares about france rn
_we only like french food and lingerie GENE_
there's so much news about "china bad"
hard disagree gene
Overestimating the average American's care for France there Gene
but i feel like they'd get macron before xi
i mean, fair enough
you underestimate the power of ignorance
my first reaction was: the cookie?
they could probably get macron
ok putin yea but i doubt many could name xi
those are the 4 I expect them to know
xi
putin
depressingly true
i'd be surprised if they could name a world leader that wasn't trump or kim jong un
ok that's
truth actually
americans have a problem paying attention to their own elections
damn, that's interesting yet i don't envy that
watching it happen has been really wack and kinda terrifying
actually, since this is basically what I'm here to study, all of my classes have been super depressing about the current state of the world
yeah tbh
it's very unfortunate
the whole world is in a conservative swing rn
ain't that lovely in a country where we've historically been miles ahead of the US in all of those areas
well, fuck him i guess
y i i i k e
"Scheer is a social conservative who‚Äôs against abortion, equal marriage, transgender rights, and assisted-suicide"
(but yeah, i realize i should probably know more about this)
he took a headshot with a painting in the background
and like
that smile is p fake
They really liked this man in out in the sticks of Quebec
i mean, his picture is kinda scary
Interesting
if he wins I might cry
andrew scheer scares me
<@!173668455856340994>
when??
wait you went to montreal??
we're super used to the presidental election being separate from congress
Dunno who the fuck that is but i saw his name on posters in Montreal
that sound hella crazy tbh
most americans are just super disconnected from parliamentary systems though
like you'd think it'd be easier with less states/provinces, whatever
that seems fair enough actually
Let's go Scheer
i mean, i just haven't heard about it
canadian politics are super complicated
side note: if i ever somehow end up as president in some alternate reality (or just famous in general) and say stupid fake shit, someone call me out on it please thanks
you really should, but I kinda get why you don't
i feel like we should but rip
not that anyone in the US cares
btw, canadian election is happening in like a month
note to self: learn to play golf by 2040
sounds like a plan
-become primer minister
-pull a putin
-meddle in elections and install a puppet
-covertly control north america
we'll get you a puppy
because i was the mastermind
cindy gets a lotta power and money and buys me a yacht to get away from gene
cindy, we need to execute this one
point is
alright well
oh
excuse you, it's prime president
then you can become president of the US _and_ Canada
i am not opposed
launch and invasion and absorb the US into Canada
secretly playing america to get screwed over in favor of benefitting canada
There will be a Wang presidency yet
lmaooo
set up Gene as your puppet
uh
wow yike
freak early delivery
they were like on a business trip
bc both his parents were americans
yeah but he still has birthright citizenship
wasn't ted cruz
that shit's so stupid
wait
I was Crushed
I remember the first time I learned that I was not allowed to run for president bc I was born in canada
hell ya
wang gang 2040?
aw thanks hun
i don't math well, but i can tell you with pretty solid certainty that cindy > trump
I think Trump's just a Celebrity. Like a lot of what he says and does isn't what he actually thinks he's just being fake to suit his interests
I wonder that about myself all the time too though so uh
or has some form of antisocial disorder
I wonder a lot if trump is a narcissist
example: trump
it's not an innate part of the human experience, but most everyone who only has one extreme is often a train wreck of a human being
tbf, i feel like it's a healthy dynamic
like some days I'm all look at me i look so good and the other 70% of the time I'm like I am literal trash. I feel like this is part of the human experience but I also feel like the opposing ends in my case are kind of extreme and I wish I could stop this
similar situation with almost everything about myself tbh
that's a mood if i've ever seen one
but yeah sometimes I'm like damn I'm the smartest person in the room fuckin bow down bitches and sometimes I'm like wow I'm a piece of shit and also incredibly stupid
y e s
like that meme
I was usually mostly asleep in tok, but occasionally someone or maners or the class itself would piss me off enough to wake me up fully
lol
i'm also impressed you guys were awake enough for this to register in your memory, cuz i certainly never was
that's actually really flattering
damn, well, i'm glad you guys appreciated it
it was during the science ethics thing
see? you thought it wasn't impressive
I remember you saying that
i have little to no recollection of saying that
also like my self-perception varies wildly day by day lol
sometimes they're kinda dumb but most of the time they're kinda brilliant
i still randomly think about it when im driving and i don't know why
ooh yeah gene makes a lot of good analogies
that blew my mind
like rules help you get there safer but not as fast as you could
the thing about speed limits and science
so yeah I don't think we're our best judges
we've had a lot of deep existential discussions
you've definitely said stuff that kinda blew my mind at some point
teachers have often been impressed by what I thought was the least impressive thing I said
then again, i guess it's kinda hard to be impressed with something that you're saying yourself, so i guess there's a degree of bias and insecurity speaking here
but i felt like a lot of the time i was substituting quantity for quality. it was like the thing i was best at was saying something mildly interesting that would get someone smarter that would actually be compelling.
i do try
you're being extra relatable tonight
dammit that's also a mood
you should see me in front of a mirror
nah, i already do that
lol
are you trying to get to the point where you can have a whole discussion with yourself?
what do you mean?
honestly, i felt like i was learning the vast majority of the time. even classes where i felt in my element (english, history, tok), people were pointing shit out i would've never seen in a million years. it was kinda humbling but also made me question if i'd ever actually get to a point where i was completely comfortable. i feel like tried as hard as i could and it somehow still wasn't enough.
like i'd take a B if it meant i could have a bit of free time and sleep at a decent time
yea i feel like i could've had a better GPA if I'd _really_ tried but I prioritized being sane a lot of the time lmao
for example, I'm 100% sure I could've been way better at physics if I tried harder
I wasn't always motivated to actually put in the work
yeah
which was part of why school frustrated me a lot
no one can be smart all the time. I feel like I'm 'smart' only because I've been pushed to be able to do what I need to in order to have the label rather than actually being innovative or a great problem solver. The biggest problem I solved recently is hiding Jarrett's body pillow lmao
I feel like the most difficult part of MOST IB classes is just the amount of workload
but it was mostly just a lot of Work? like I didn't feel like I was learning much from a lot of them
oh no every class was a grind
i'm kinda jealous, cuz every class felt like a grind for me in ib (and the vast majority of them in high school). still, i gotta respect that.
granted, the ones that were hard were really painful, i.e. when we got into weirder corners of calc, or when I was trying to wrap my head around the relationships between GDP, price levels, and unemployment
I'm an actual dumbass 95% of the time and sometimes I really don't think I'm suited to academia at all but I am aware that theoretically I'm smart. in hindsight, only half at most of my classes were challenging in content for me, even in ib
no i admired that about you. Or admire, i should say, because I still do. That you always have things to say but it's actually interesting and continues the conversation
again, really not trying to flex, but I guess I'm naturally pretty outspoken and I learn pretty fast. like I don't make excuses to talk More, but I usually have a decent amount to say, and I'm not afraid of talking a lot
(which you guys did as well, and i really appreciated that)
i'm honestly just glad they cared
ok mood
if it helps, i worried about me too
i think a lot of teachers were worried about you lmao
sometimes when you skipped class or were late or whatever Mrs. Gregory would be like "I hope he's getting some sleep"
so i'm fine with it going forward
granted, i expect the average person is more like a teacher than a random group of high school students stuck in an enclosed community for four years
and a lot of teachers certainly did, but some of the other people in the room would often make me kinda uncomfortable for trying to act natural
i believe this is what the kids on the street refer to as "no chill"
and gene i felt like a lot of teachers appreciated you though
damn
like in 6th period stats Mr. Duggan mentioned that everyone in that class and on the swim team was failing except me because we left class early so much
i feel like i stood out in the majority of my classes. granted, not necessarily in a good way, but i'm just kinda loud and talkative, so that shit happens. there are some classes where i really wish i kinda just shut up.
unless it was an on level class, which it was p easy to stand out in a class of people who don't care to pay attention or put any work in
i feel like i was mostly too quiet to stand out much in any class
^
i can understand that. i can't say i relate, but i can see how that would work.
exceptions for art and hl math
also ok I don't wanna come across as arrogant but I was pretty confident in my ability to be a standout in basically any class in hs
like I dont think I did it as consciously
yeah I didn't give as much of a shit
skyline wasn't really graded on a curve though?
yesish
did you do this at skyline?
and yeah, i guess that makes sense
several of them are my friends, it's not like it's necessarily a bad thing, but I've like mentally marked them as people I will definitely be competing against
that's fair enough, cindy
like later he said didn't happen very often or something but i am still kinda wary of trusting my UW classmates
for me it's more like I can already tell who's actually got a good chance at/is really gunning for reaching the higher end of said curve
older siblings do be like that
take it with a grain of salt because my brother likes to freak me out over school things sometimes
chill, it's probably not that bad, and you should be questioning other peoples' info anyways
as someone who has a tendency to be overly trusting of other people, this is my worst nightmare
that sounds absolutely fucking terrifying to me
that's super wack tbh
yeah never heard of that here
oh damn
y i k e
i've heard it depends on the school's culture
david (my bro) said that people would give each other wrong answers to take advantage of the curve
like......... literally??
fun times i guess
do people fuck each other oVEr to get the benefit of the curve?
I prob should've mentioned that
yep
i take it y'all are graded on a pretty harsh curve too?
i mean, i guess i can see where you're coming from
the vast majority of people don't stand out and ultimately they don't really matter in class, as bad as that sounds
and I'm like ok you're my real competition here
like, I notice Immediately when someone tries to play favorites with the prof or is a know-it-all or is just genuinely smart/talented
wdym?
idk if this is me being paranoid or catty
lowkey, I feel like I've already staked out all my competitors in each class
like actually
i'm really happy for you
you did lmao
so far so good
I feel like I've already talked a lot about how college is going though
insta is kinda weird to me still anyways lol
will do
tbh it's almost always a better option to just dm me on discord
that happens
haha no worries
btw, I totally forgot to respond to your insta dm
thanks. i'll probably need it lol
well, good luck to you too
i don't really like my floaty "eh, you got class now but then a few hours off and then another" schedule, but i guess it'll help me learn to make use of time in between shit, which i'm not good at (and probably why i dislike this kind of thing)
eh, it makes deadlines sound a little tighter, but i don't mind it in theory
this has kinda always been my approach to life, sprint and then break
tues/thurs are so chill
but I really like my on/off thing
some days I have 5+ hours of back-to-back classes
wdym?
a lot of people would hate what I'm doing I think
rip that sounds awesome
tues/thurs starts at 3:30
mon/wed starts at 11
earliest is 10 am, and that's one day
do you have morning classes?
like I'm done w everything due tomorrow rn
I just do it bc a) Im used to it b) it gives me time to either fuck around or work on personal stuff and c) I can and still get enough sleep
the fact that that sounds like a foreign concept boggles my mind
I don't actually need to stay up till 1-3 every night
lol I mean
but that first sentence let me let out the biggest sigh of relief in a long while lol
best of luck
but they're also all fairly short
I know I have a few essays coming my way within the next month
this might change, idk how much more workload is gonna ramp up
tbh, I'm in a dual degree program and taking more classes than recommended and I still feel like I have way more free time than I did in ib
although the hope is that now that i know what this is like, hopefully i can make this time for myself in college or just treat the entire experience as such (or, more realistically at least *less* responsibility than IB rip)
actually working and then being done at 5 to have that 0 obligation feeling sounds like bliss
i kinda just wanna yeet in and out of college at this point tbh
i don't think i ever did
I can't remember the last time before this past summer when I had 0 obligations
summer before senior year was me cramming for subject tests and attempting to write stuff for colleges
never again
i.e. summer before junior year was me going through SAT bootcamp
tbh, a lot of the time, it was worse than school itself
and filled with dread/fear for said things
but was dedicated to prepping for whatever was coming next
every year before was technically a "break"
like
yeah I had a p great summer, excluding aforementioned parental shit
R I G H T ? ?
THIS IS THE BIGGEST MOOD
`this was the summer i was always denied growing up lmao`
this was the summer i was always denied growing up lmao
it's everything i always imagined second semester senior year was going to be, except second semester was an actual shit show, and i now get to live that life without what i'm doing and where i am being dictated by someone/something else almost 24/7
granted, i know i have to be productive in life and do general survival stuff (that's a given), but like just being able to take a deep breath and not feeling like i'm somehow wasting time by doing so is somehow everything i ever wanted
and like, i stepped back and was like "damn, i'd much rather live the rest of my life like this than go back to the shit i previously had to do"
i guess this summer's just been really different from like my entire life
to get back into
that was really weird
true
ok fair enough
even if it's a college class, i can't imagine myself sitting in any classroom next wednesday
I mean you guys had a long ass summer
i think what really hasn't sunk in is that i'm still in school, as weird as that is
but i reference it humorously way more often than i should
i don't think it's meant to be entirely true
shitfucktons of skyline kids go to uw so that doesn't entirely surprise me, but I also feel like that's not entirely true
as my counselor told me, uw's pretty much just skyline v2.0
it's just uw being uw again
lmao sorry to bother you with that
enjoy
but yeah
there was already the whole parking thing that I didn't understand and ignored
so be prepared for some predictable moving-related complaints in this channel
people start moving in wednesday, but most of us are moving thursday through saturday
that's perfectly alright
when do y'all move in to UW
don't worry bout it you're all good
you're never the one who brings it up that's just on me
understood. i won't talk about any more unless you want to then.
then I guess I started actually thinking about it more and was like wow this is fucked so yeah my bitterness is back full force, but y'all have been exposed to that already lol. don't really wanna talk about it Even More
there was a point where I was like relatively at peace with them and my whole situation with them
that's fair enough, but you always deserve to hear how proud we are of you when situation merits it.
I've angsted about my parents way too much in the past few months
whatever it's over and I don't wanna dwell on it too much
so i feel like you did a great job, regardless of what your parents may have said about it
it was ultimately a success for you (i mean, you're doing great now!), and i got to be friends with you because of it
if it helps, i'm glad you did what you did senior year
awww, cindy
yay!
but I Tried and it fucked my happiness more than anything else so. stopped trying to chase perfection and focused on other stuff, which led to slightly worse gpa 1st sem senior year, which led to pissing off my parents a lot, which led to more stress and what I would hesitantly call verbal abuse, which led to increased demotivation and falling apart second sem
aww, i'm sorry. it's always rough when something doesn't pan out after a lot of work.
I mean I kinda already knew that that kind of approach really doesn't come naturally to me
I tried really hard and it still didn't exactly work out and I was literally devastated over that for like a solid few months
idk I feel like that's when I decided that being that dedicated to school/grade-focused really wasn't worth it for me
(not specifically you if that wasn't clear btw. just in general)
it's always fucking math, ngl
2nd sem junior year I got a B- in math and As in everything else and it kinda killed me inside and that's approximately when I stopped giving a fuck again
oof, junior year was when i started slipping
I remember it being a huge grind
I will say junior year was easily my Peak School Performance
does that not count?
the vast majority of my legit memories from both are tied to jsa and not School
nothing super notable happened in either of them
most of freshman and junior year are kinda blurs for me
in summary:
senior year--highest highs, lower lows than mankind should ever know
junior year--everything i never wanted out of high school
sophomore year--weird glimmer of hope things would be alright, but i've soured on it since because didn't work out
freshman year--manageable. there were some yike moments in here but nothing i couldn't handle. i grew from it without always feeling like i didn't want to exist.
nah it's good
sorry for the ramble lmao
in hindsight, i wish i were better and that i learned more quickly to take care of myself, but i guess i got those things in the end
ah
ib itself was a good decision. the decisions i made while in ib were less so.
some of the stress i put myself through was unnecessary and college apps were a shit show. idk if i was burnt out or something, but second semester was a weird living hell. it was a good learning experience, but i think i still would've gotten a message with just a week of that shit.
what were you referring to here then?
`the good parts were fun, but i'd be fucking delusional to say it was worth it`
i guess i kinda needed it in a sense to see where my limits were and how to cope with that
i definitely feel it was worth it. i don't regret it either, but that doesn't mean it wasn't an absolute trainwreck
personally I still feel that ib was worth it for me. I've never actually regretted taking it. school stress was def a factor in the collapse of my mental health lol but a lot of it was also external stuff and me finally snapping under my family's bullshit
i don't think i ever literally threw myself at a window due to stress during any other high school year. the good parts were fun, but i'd be fucking delusional to say it was worth it. i grew the most from it though, that's for sure.
t r u t h
so idk how to rank things
senior year had the highest highs but also the lowest lows
well
although there's only so many years to choose from, so idk if "one of my fave" means much relative to the other years lol
fair enough
tbh that was one of my fave years of hs
~~those were the days~~ fuck sophomore year
ah, 10th grade
yeah
remember when we thought it was cool when we got those first emails?
i love how stupid this entire email system is
lmao
O O O F
oh also Boston U sent me some shit about applying for their trustee scholarship and I was like lmao you mean the thing you rejected me from last winter? I'm good
I didn't either
although to their credit, i had no idea wsu had a location in vancouver beforehand
they send it to my spam email though, so i don't really care tbh
same lmao
I asked out of curiosity bc I just finally snapped and blocked them both
tbh most of them have backed off for me but for some reason WSU Vancouver (the inferior vancouver) and Montana State University reeeeeeeaaally want me to apply
gotta rack up them transfers
yikes
thanks, collegeboard
they'll keep doing it for a while too so i've heard
oh hell ya
do colleges still spam email y'all
oh aweomse
come visit us!! we miss you
I'm still thinking it over but there's a pretty high chance I'll be buying a ticket soon
bc my parents are gonna be in china so it'd actually be lit
30% is potentially visiting you guys and 10% is Real Alone Time
I'm not even kidding grabbing shit I forgot or decided not to bring is like 60% of my motivation to go home in october
granted, it's significantly harder for me to go home and grab something I forgot or take a trip to costco lol
and yeah i think that's a fair amount? Maybe?
they're just leftover boxes from online orders so they aren't the biggest boxes tho
I filled the trunk of a minivan
must've been a lot of work
daaamn
i have like six cardboard boxes, two duffel bags, two plastic bins for my art supplies and my backpack
fair
it makes packing the next time even easier
I've lived here for more than 3 weeks now
just be like me and never fully unpack
my suitcase still has shit in it
I hate unpacking even more than I hate packing
what do you mean they won't all fit
i want three big blankets goddamnit
I just want to bring my entire room with me
take a break if you need it, jane. you're doing great.
awww i'm sorry
but now i'm tired and grumpy
i didn't think i would
who doesn't
does anyone else just hate packing
Mine is probably poor quality
A bathroom lock is gonna very different from an outside door lock
My lock is pretty small so many hairpins probably won't work
It greatly depends on the lock quality
I don't have a hairpin rn sad
She told me she learned bc one of her cats would repeatedly lock themselves in a bathroom
My roommate knows how to do it with hairpins it's pretty lit
I kinda want to get a lock picking set just to know how
if you have the materials for 3 I'd do it since it's good practice
3) Pick your own lock
2) Wait for a roomate
1) Go to the front desk and ask
I guess you have a few options
sounds like fun
Yay I locked myself out of my room üôÉ
doesn't include personal electronics, clothes, or medication etc etc
so all furniture, appliances, kitchenware, etc
this doc has the list of things that aren't considered personal effects
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zu1TmFyX8JO4AQXEXi7ZmDU7AraF-fe7tW0gofBSWTs/edit?usp=drivesdk
Basically says if you have your car parked in certain lots, gtfo bc move in is happening in those areas
I got this today
well shit
you won't be able to park (or at least you won't be able to park easily)
Thanks for finding that Gene
So how much is this gonna fuck with me if I'm moving in on Saturday?
https://hfs.uw.edu/Guides-and-Handbooks/UW-Welcome-Guide-Residence-Halls.aspx
page 19 on this, because they for some fucking reason thought we were going to read this
<@&574247915518689281> found it
also, my roommate has a rice cooker and a water heaty thingy
battle royale
if y'all don't have one and we're not using it, lemme know and i can walk it across the hall to y'all
there's one on the floor, but there are times when everyone will try to fight over it at once
hmu
if anyone ever wants rice
oh i didn't bring a vaccuum
me: i should bring a vacuum cleaner
my mom: sure
me: i need shampoo and conditioner
mom: sure
me: costco-size pack of toilet paper
my mom: ok
me: switch dock
my mom: WAIT WHYYYYY THAT'S TOOO MUCCHHH
I forgot that pack that stuff too
Ah fuck yeah
i need to pack period stuff
oh shit
-clothes
-bedstuff
-microwave
-rice cooker
-toiletries
-makeup/skincare
What else?
-clothes
-bed stuff
-toiletries
-cubes
my parents hate that i'm bringing my makeup actually
Bruh what are y'all even packing?
i'm sorry i want to bring my portable clothes steamer
like
s a m e
Moving in on saturday
i'm still getting yelled at about overpacking
I'm doing a little roundabout thing
F
no
and i take it you guys don't know anything about parking passes either?
damn that was a lot less resist than i expected
Ah sure why not
i don't wanna be alone ._.
pls join me
Maybe I'll go for the funzies
man jarrett
Like living there at that point in time
I'll be there
i mean, i'd be willing to see them talk for all of five minutes
Oh wait
The president
president of uw
whomst is "that man/woman"?
come say hi to me
*woman
do it for the parents
hey
you skip the fucking picnic
But you really going to see that man talk?
gotta pay for food somehow
that's why
hm, fair enough
Ah yeah I guess
i somehow did not expect this
the picnic after costs money
what
it costs money
20 for the student
i heard convocation was free
wait what the hell
i thought that's just picnic
$26
i convinced my parents to butt out so no i'm not going
what is it even? is it a lot of money?
wdym?
yike though. they're not forcing me, so i feel bad for you.
Spendid use of money that convocation
i was gonna figure it out latter, but my parents have gone all "TELL US NOWWW"
parents decided to butt in on the matter
yes
also, are any of y'all going to the new student convocation thingy on sunday?
so maybe wsu is a lil bit better
which actually does lead me to believe they don't care
their move in video literally said they'd include it in the assignment email, but i'm not seeing it
jk uhhh i don't think we get those until we get there
care about you
stop expecting institutions to like
listen dude
<@&574247915518689281> weren't they supposed to email us a parking pass of some sort so we can park on our move in day?
Go eat
Good
ok thanks I needed motivation to get out of bed
Yes
I'm like really not hungry but I feel like i should consume something
should I go eat actual food
Decoration looks really nice!
Four more days
I don't wanna look at my credit card bill right now lol
and the most expensive~~
alan's gonna end up w the most aesthetic dorm outta all of us calling it now
wooow I love that!!
total cost: around $12
wall decor update
Only furniture I could buy is like a little chair/glorified stool that opens up and doubles as a box. I might be like a mini bookshelf if I have room, but I'd have to check and see how much space I have after moving in.
Alan has more room than the rest of us cuz they don't have a third roommate. Assuming nothing he's buying is too big, they should have room, and I'm jealous
whenever I have a guest over I'm gonna make the habit of watering the fake plants and see if they catch on
- fake plants
and see my collection of
COME OVER FOR TEA
but again
I think it'll fit, and if not I'll have to raise my bed
- side table for the lounge chair
- lounge chair
- foldable coffee table
- 2x4 square organizer shelving
I added
- one nightstand/drawer thing
- wardrobe
- shitty desk chair
- desk
- bed (that needs a mattress pad because the actual mattress sucks)
UW gives you
also my brother told me that you don't get any discounts for paying with your UW meal plan, the only thing you get sometimes is a free beverage
I don't think it does
^
Does UW not give you a bookshelf
Do you have room for this stuff?
Come over for a chat over tea sometime
Chair and side table for reading manga
Got a tea table, bookshelf, rug, tea set
I'm all fancy
do they not provide you with furniture?
Ikea?
Fancy
Damn wow
I'm at Ikea right now buying most of the last of my stuff
Might also bring it some other time
I might bring rice but the amount may vary
I have furikake
Get some furikake
Pro tip if youre gonna do that
i am DOWN
Bruh you cooking rice in your dorm?
How weird would I be if I just dragged in a Costco bag of rice into the dorm
Better question
Well
A lil bit
wait <@&574247915518689281> have you guys started packing for college?
feel better you two
a bunch of my friends are sick though which is a bit of an L
I thought I was getting sick but turns out my allergies are just ridiculously bad rn for unknown reasons
rip
I'm also the first person I've seen sick, which means hopefully I'm ground zero and I won't have to deal with it anymore this year
so I'm officially sick for the first time at college
Unless you're in a communal bathroom
I wouldn't think so
Supply us with some?
Do they not like
I'm mainly talking to the UW people since we haven't moved in yet
No
Wait, do you need it for communal bathrooms?
PSA: remember to bring toilet paper when you move in
lol
Damn
Idk how good TAs are at checking emails and whatnot
Maybe access to contact information?
Nobody is left out then
Orgys
also I'm impressed that you're awake, if I had a choice I would not be
by said TA, as like a "how can I help" type of questionnaire
In what context is the question being asked?
also very highkey my history TA is literally the Liberal American stereotype
how do I answer the question "what makes an inclusive classroom"
help
aw yiss
Of course!
You're voting for him, right?
Best student government campaign poster I've seen yet
Good luck!
Sounds awesome
it has begun
sweatshirt and leggings it is
I can't be bothered today
alright
oh ew it's raining
But yeah, go do that, Cindy. You got class later. Good luck!
I'm still in bed
and put on real clothes
get out of my bathrobe
I need to actually
dammit
F
I'll think about it
Gotta get up high on r/pornhubcomments
Please don't call me that ever again
Yike
I wanna be that guy in the comments saying "Big Wang over there plays a mean pichu"
yikes
So let's do it
I'm too emotionally unstable to make it in a professional field anyways
I'll shoot a porno with you Noah ;)
lmaooooo
just links
also if any of you make it in the porn industry, you don't need to share photos
You get two shots at it
It can't hurt to apply
yikes!
Worst case scenario, I'll send Noah a nude when I'm 43, cuz if I haven't made it by then, my peak in life will probably be hitting on Noah with nudes
I really wanna do it sooner but I'm starting to think next would be better
if I wanna apply to intern w the usfs this summer or next
I'm trying to decide
But I'll try my best to remember
It might be a while lol
<@!478706068223164416> Hilton is better, I should know :)
that'd be super cool
oooh
when you feel like "I've made it" send me a photo
all of you
alright
highkey
if that happens send pics
now I'm imagining cindy in a really fancy ass suit sipping white wine at the top of a marriot hotel in taipei or some shit
‚ù§
international businesswoman sounds like a badass title ngl
foreign business relations rep
Yeah, I get you
if that makes sense lol
and not super related, though expertise in each would help in the other's field
an engineer that knows enough to figure out what kind of specific engineer to call upon
it's really not a jumbo degree bc both degrees I'm going for are pretty specific
I'm pretty sure I'm the opposite though
one-size-fits-all engineer
"I am an engineer"
"what type?"
"yes"
A dual degree like Cindy mentioned is p close to a jumbo degree
I like it
*jumbo degree*
but I am doing a business dual degree so there's that
I picked the most specific major of my options lmao
I'm the opposite
or something
a jumbo degree
they're related enough just gimme like
so instead, minor in Materials, bachelors in Mech, and Masters in Aero
ikr it's so sad
but they won't let you *for some reason*
I wanted to major in Aero, Mech, and Materials
hey similar
Lmao
basically I'm trying to say I wanted a triple major in CS, CPE, and HCDE but I was only allowed one
That's fair enough
CS and HCDE are just more focused versions of what I wanted, and I think CPE grants me more freedom to explore the other two
^
and also that's cute
glad to hear it
`listen, everyone has to put up with some level of bullshit bc of college systems`
actually I'm loving engineering
I wish I could have gone to UW, but now that am I WSU as far as engineering goes I don't really care anymore
however I do miss Salina a lot, so I do wish I could have gone to UW
I mean, I chose CPE because I wanted somewhere where I could do all the parts of computing, from hardware to software to human interface
I mean, Alan, you'd do great in HCDE if you ever ended up there
cough plagiarism cough
it's what I do best lol
They're just different styles, and they're both helpful
same concept, different words
lmao he's much better at the gentle reassurance thing
me: you're not unique
alan: it's ok, everyone goes through this
you're doing great. I tend to come across as overly harsh bc I'm blunt. I'm not mad at you or anything
you don't have to apologize
Thank you, Alan. I appreciate the other options. I've looked into a lot of those, but it's nice to hear someone else say it. It feels less cornering if that makes any sense. You're right though.
And Cindy, sorry about that. I'm not sure if I'm a slow learner or just get caught up in my head, but that happens a lot for me (which, granted, is probably a terrible trait for either an engineer or designer). I guess I don't do great with anticipation and waiting.
*they work in tandem with software and hardware engineers to create workable solutions for human-facing products*
*ftr HCDE (for those less acquainted) is, broadly, the UI/UX part of the computing field, dealing primarily in how users and clientele interact with machines and programs*
lol
fuck it I'll major in japanese
and if HCDE fucks me over
plus HCDE is my backup if CompE fucks me over
I know because I was considering a design minor in something, but couldn't find anything small enough to meet my needs
for what I've seen, UW has design schools for art art design, art history design, business oriented design, UI/UX design, web design, and a lot more
I suggest taking a look at the DESIGN school courses and maybe finding something there
it is valid and normal to be frustrated. I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm also saying that at some point you gotta stop thinking in circles, accept the situation and see what you can do about it
I looked at the prereqs, and while they aren't as physics and calculus focused as some others, it still requires some stats and science
my take on it is, if you're not down to do stem, then HCDE probably isn't right for you
and I'm not trying to be rude, I'm trying to snap him out of the seemingly repetitive mindset
Alan still has a good point
it's human centered design engineering after all
it is
I think his point is that hcde is in the school of engineering
and if you do end up deciding to go into a design or non engi major, you can just not do the prerequisites/requirements needed for engineering or engineering majors
someone in gen admit has as much of a chance getting into a design program as you do right now
thing is, you're no closer to a non-engineering major than any other student
I think you're just frustrated with yourself because you feel like you've somehow robbed yourself of something
that much is completely normal and is to be expected
I'm sure a number of folks put down an engineering major, got into the college, then realized that they don't actually wanna do engineering
i may be missing something but i feel like yall are being a bit rude
I think what Gene's going through is pretty normal
(I've been shadowing this entire thing after doing some workouts)
if I may
I guess you're right. I'm sorry I took out my frustrations on y'all. I know you guys have your own sets of bullshit to put up with. It's unfair for me to expect it to be any different for me, and I should know better than that at this point.
It's just been really disorienting to be told by pretty much everyone that this was the best case scenario for me and that this was supposed to be something I'm proud of when there's very little here that I wanted to begin with. I guess I started panicking when getting called and asked to act like something that I'm not. But again, I should know better than that and be able to keep a level head about it.
but that's kinda the point, you know all of this already. we know all of this already. yeah, it sucks. too bad, tbh
I basically just regurgitated stuff you already knew
you can always drop out and do something else if you find that you hate it That Much
in which case there's no point in bemoaning all the engineering stuff you have to take
right now it sounds like you're going with the latter
just make a decision, either you drop out of engineering and try to pursue something else or you suck it up on the chance you can make it into hcde
if hcde is your actual goal then it sounds like you're gonna have to stick to the typical stem stuff for at least a year
yeah it sucks you're taking classes you don't want to, but honestly, you kinda just gotta tough it out
I get kicked out of my program if I don't maintain absurdly high grades because other people are also fighting to get into my major lol
noah's at wsu bc he didn't get direct to uw's school of engineering and it's hell to try to get there after
salina has to literally fight tooth and nail to get into her major
this isn't a problem unique to you
listen, everyone has to put up with some level of bullshit bc of college systems
I'm more pissed that I have to go through the college of engineering's system to get to a spot in the HCDE program, which doesn't feel like an engineering major at all, even in terms of its content.
The thing is, I'm pretty sure I'd be more than happy to land an HCDE major within the college of engineering. This is just the bullshit I have to put up with to get there. Sure, there are other majors outside the college that have varying degrees of appeal, but I'm honestly not super worked up about what I'm majoring in as long as I find the content I'm learning interesting and useful. Year 2 and beyond would be interesting and useful, but it's a crapshoot whether I get there or not.
you know what's going to happen, you know how you have an out if you so chose to take it, there's no point is stressing about the inevitable
get out if you hate it and move on
A lot of people change majors in college, it wouldn't be surprising for anyone if you dropped it
but I'd work on trying to figure that out instead of going in circles about not wanting to be in engineering
which is valid
the real problem here is that you don't know what you want
dont feel obligated to stay in engineering if you know you're gonna hate it
Nothing's changing between now and then, and that's something I have to live with
I mean, that's kind of the point. The problem is still there until I start classes.
because this is just leading to a repetitious cycle of the same issue
i don't think saying your only option is "don't think about it" is accurate
to be honest
you better be doing lines of math off your desk in your free time if you wanna do engineering
I'm aware. It still pisses me off every now and then since the only thing I can do for now is "don't think about it," which is pretty hard
it's a lot of fucking math
just to ram home the amount of math
you have to take about 8 - 10 just math classes
about 5 - 7 science class which are math heavy (the 3 physics are basically pure math, chem is much less)
and every single engineering class you take will be super math heavy which is gonna be around 7 - 10 or so
Gene i feel like people have had this convo with you before
And Cindy, I try my best not to get to worked up about this, but it periodically comes to mind when I start thinking about college. I can't help it.
The thing is, I'm not gonna know if it's what I want until June. The actual HCDE program is a lot less STEM-heavy. But it's a crapshoot until then
Don't feel obligated
While you're stuck in it, do your best, but if it's not what you want there's no point in staying
If you don't like math you are not gonna enjoy this
It's UW. Direct to college was the only thing mildly resembling security in terms of majors short of CS. The assumption was I could yeet myself out whenever, but I feel obligated to at least give it a shot.
So I would suggest getting out as soon as possible
Currently it seems engineering has literally nothing to offer to you (other than a spot at UW)
^
and I wouldn't stress too much about it before you've even started
but this is where you're at rn
try to make your own path
yeet yourself out of engineering if you want to
point being, again I don't wanna sound harsh but it's facts, the end decision was yours and now you're just gonna have to live with it
but you fucked yourself here
I've been talking about all the math for the last two years
i'm really sorry to say this
Gene
Also, I got mildly pressured into it by family
but still, I feel like if you knew you dislike math/science for that long, idk why you would go for the highly competitive school that's loaded with math/science
It's engineering
It was a last-minute decision, and I wasn't aware the content was gonna be this STEM-heavy
(don't get me wrong, I loved my science and math teachers, and some of the content was ok/tolerable, so I'm being a bit dramatic, but still)
I know you said you weren't sure what you were gonna major in
Those are complaints that could be made for practically every major
Oh <@503787499605458954> got to it first
Look
Wait so why did you apply for a stem thing?
ok I don't wanna sound harsh but tbh, if you knew that, why did you apply to engineering
<@340319804747415553> in regard to your earlier comment, I get the need to just grind it out, and I have every intention of doing so, but I'm pissed that I have to to begin with. I'm competing in STEM classes against students who are actually good and care about STEM subjects as someone who struggles through SL Math and hasn't actually enjoyed learning STEM content since like 6th grade math
idk if he wants to do stem
So as long as you go into something stem you should be fine
I mean the first two years of engineering are mostly just gen stuff, lots of math, and lots of sciences
Just go find an umlaut
Lmao
Jkjk
Not Swedish enough
They should be on sale at Ikea or something
Her designs are really cool
But yeah
I think she applied into it at some point
Like designing lamp shades and stuff
Idk Lily that well. If she is, awesome. It's still an amazing program. The name is just stupid.
She's doing industrial design
Is that what lily is doing
Which I fully agree with, cuz it's just User Experience
Human Center Design and Engineering. According to my brother who even fucking majored in the program, it's a fancy name so people with egos can feel like they're better than other people and so parents feel like their kids are doing something complicated
I‚Äôm really sorry but if that‚Äôs the way it is you‚Äôre gonna need to put the pedal to the metal
Then don‚Äôt give them an excuse to not let you into the major
What's HCDE
Rip
Which isn't the worst thing in the world, because I'll probably just yeet myself out of the college if it happens, but I won't have pre-reqs for other similar majors done because HCDE has vastly different pre-reqs by virtue of being in engineering
Yeah
Wait lol is that seriously how it works?
The difference is that they're gonna try to shoehorn me into a different engineering major
I mean
Me: Hi, give me HCDE because that's what I'm here for and I put up with a year of your bull‚Äî
UW: NOPE, YOU'RE A CHEMICAL ENGINEER NOW
Me: Dude, I don't know how much a mol‚Äî
UW: WAIT, THAT GOT FILLED UP! YOU'RE A CIVIL ENGINEER NOW!
Me: h e l p
Sorry gene
This is how the cookie crumbles
I mean I‚Äôm trying to get into a program with a sub 10% acceptance
Yeah, but I have zero fucking agency over what my major is
And duke is like lol you wanted to switch? Go ahead
But basically uw is screwy bc they have so many capacity constrained majors
Applying direct to major sucks because tons of people like to switch majors during college
I was not aware I was doing that
^ that‚Äôs how duke works
Applying to a school within the college is pretty common
It was a last-minute decision because I really just wanted to apply to UW. October Gene had not thought 4 years ahead about what he wanted to major in at UW. He was still stressed about other schools
I was filling out my UW application at like 11PM and was like "what, I have to pick a major? Uh ok"
Saw the program my brother got a masters in and said "yeah, he's a cool guy" and thought they would give me direct placement into the major like they do CS or like ANY MAJOR AT A NORMAL SCHOOL instead of this "direct to college" bullshit that they use to lure students into applying
Honestly, there is *nothing* that pisses me off more now than people thinking I'm an engineer now or something
Probably a design major that doesn't require the bullshit the UX program does
Not that I HAVE a major to begin with
I share your sentiments on engineering
What do you want to be in other than engineering?
I apply for a different major
what happens if you leave?
I'm giving it two quarters
How far will I get before fucking yeet myself out of UW Engineering cuz it's a shitshow and I hate engineering
Ok, let's place some bets
That's fine. Just discuss it in your conclusion. That shit happens
so then your report ends up not coming to the conclusion they wanted you to
you know when you're doing a lab and you get "lucky" with your measurements and it fucks over the idea of the lab
Ooo ok. Sounds good. Thanks for the info!
i think the practice rooms in the music school are for music majors only, or people taking a music class
it's in maple so you get free access and it isn't far away
https://www.washington.edu/area01/labs/sound/
no sweat
Oh, phew. That's a relief to hear. Thank you, Jane. I really appreciate it.
you're gonna be fine
there are spaces for practicing music and the top floor of Odegaard Library is my favorite place on campus (that I know). it's completely silent and it has little cubby areas for you to be by yourself and work on things
david (my brother) says that there are a lot of places to go if you want to be alone on campus
did not tell me where any of them are but im sure we can find some
Thanks for the tip though. I'll consider it once I move in
Uh, I think it's a bit overkill, but I get the general idea
It's so I can stay up late but not light up the room with my monitors
They're cheap paper blinds
Ok
Damn
This when I was first setting up after moving in
I didn't know I had claustrophobia before looking at that first picture tbh
Oh my god
Are those like shower curtains?
What am I looking at
I'm so confused
The "leave me alone" desk setup
Solution
Ah
Pretty much anything really, I have trouble focusing with people around
Can't work on personal projects?
I pretty much grew up as an only child, so it'll be pretty wild.
I'm gonna be so unproductive in college lmao. Always being in a room with 2+ people is gonna wreck any sense of productivity I can muster (not that it's much to begin with). I can't practice music if someone's listening, work on a personal project if someone's nearby, and sleep properly if someone's in the room.
Rip stay safe
The storm has arrived at WSU
Already have a project I want to use it for
have fun lol
wholesome
But WSU does
BC didn't give it out for free
I'm very excited
fun
We're getting MatLab today
like more paranoia-fueled than racial zealot
ok I worded that badly he just has a different aura
genocidal yeah psychopathic or sociopathic almost definitely, but less or at least more subtle straight-up-insane vibes. holodomor was politically motivated
That seems kinda genocidal maniac to me
Purging the jews?
Holodomor?
Bruh
but I mean they're all very distinct figures
mild disagree on being that much different from Stalin, who you could argue did a lot of good for the soviet union at the time, and who, despite orchestrating genocide, I would not consider a genocidal maniac
General point is that he's much different than Hitler, Stalin, and Pol Pot
But the red soldiers being the red soldiers of course didnt happen all the time
Well actually I know if you gave up everything as a landowner sometimes they were chill with that
Definetely for the bourgeoisie kinda stuff but as for specific areas I believe most of that was for geographical convenience
So it just depends how you wanna quantify it
China's population is so huge that comparatively 60-75 million isn't that high of a %
"vast swaths" is debatable
But I've seen it argued and it can be argued, bc a lot of the shit he pulled was in specific areas and/or targeting presumed "enemies of the state" or "bourgeoisie", which included academics or intellectuals who opposed him, which sounds kinda like the Cambodian genocide
I just don't like comparing Mao to Hitler and Stalin in terms of people killed because while Mao was a bad dude, he didn't actively seek to eliminate vast swaths of the population
Most historians don't count it as one
I don't have a strong opinion either way
I'm not entirely disagreeing with you
Actually more grindelwald lol
Nah that was Grindelwald
Getting all voldy up in here
And lots of anti semitism, etc
More like I'm aware that this is gonna kill a lot of people but Imma do it anyways "for the greater good"
And Stalin actively did Holodomor and all that
Whereas Hitler is uhhh Hitler
Like "ah that was supposed to help, but it didn't"
And if im not wrong most of the people he killed can fall under an oopsie moment
Doesn't genocide require targeting of a specific group?
Imo you cant
There were a lot of executions but it's debatable whether or not you can count what he did as systematic genocide
Also, most of it came from shit like mass flooding, forced industrialization, and mass starvation vs. straight up firing squads and gassing
Mao's more controversial bc despite killing roughly 60-75 million people he improved quality of life and life expectancy in China during his rule in a lot of ways and his more questionable methods are often overlooked bc a) Chinese propaganda and b) China's population still grew an insane amount during his rule
Never liked that whole "Stalin killed X amount", "Mao killed X amount" in comparison to Hitler
I almost puked
Also my sociology prof mentioned (I kid you not): Thomas Kuhn, theory of knowledge, capital R Reason, ways of knowing, paradigm shifts, and anomalies, and used the phrase "to what extent" in a single lecture
It was a fun class
Today in poli we talked about Trump's totalitarian tendencies and about how Chairman Mao killed more people than Hitler and Stalin combined
Go stop the alt right on your own :p
Lol go Helen
Hell fucking yeah!!
Just found out I can vote in NC! it's great bc NC is a swing state
I'm so sleepy
should I get coffee at 3 pm
nice
I think to them, HS is so far removed that they don't even think of the freshmen as just coming from high school lmao
All my profs don't say that
I have my first 3 hour history lecture today lol wish me luck
I don't think we've really done anything meaningful in that class yet
it feels like ib english cont., but kinda dumbed down in some ways
I like all of mine, the only class I don't really care about so far is global arts studies which is my required lit/writing component
Which is nice
Actually for the most part all my professors have been rather to the point and just get on with class
maybe that's 'cause of ib, idk
like schedule and freedom and atmosphere wise it's v different obviously but work-wise, reading-wise, essay-wise it's basically the same
except my russian prof, actually
lol literally all of mine have
Haven't had a single professors say anything about that
Really?
'cause honestly it really feels like the same old
also highkey I'm getting v tired of profs being all like "this is gonna be so different from what you're used to in high school"
why is my history class in the chemistry building????
My last two years weren't *that* bad
Really?
high school is a shitshow yeah
it could be way worse
have my entire social life and friend groups be determined by a random number generator
have back-to-back classes non-stop throughout the day
be stuck in one building until 3PM
have class at 8AM
i could, ya know
yeah, i mean
it's not too bad I'm sure
which was marginally better, but had this same issue
with the exception with one other pick
this was kinda the only possible thing
they have a thing where they put together different schedules for you with the classes you picked
i tried
you can look at myplan and see if you have a better option
it'd be nicer to get through the day's classes at once and find time to study before/after
yeah, but it's easier to plan those when i'm not trying to sandwich it between classes
it's lowkey good to have some time blocked out specifically for that
you can do library or study
well that's fine
i have a three-hour gap between classes at some point in my schedule
what?
i'm gonna have fun sitting in the library 3 hours a week with nothing to do twice a week
the more i look at my schedule, the more i realize it's an inbred abomination
they didn't
nvm, just checked
i'm kinda terrified that they didn't show us who they were beforehand
also, does anyone know if they ever released the math profs?
why is hfs's website complete and utter ass
Can I just move in and claim squatters rights
same
cuz it's for some ungodly reason separate from tuition
I still need to pay tuition
No idea
do you know how to pay hfs?
Fuck the custom publications
Uw is big dumb when it comes to textbooks
that's good to know
huh, interesting
The zumdahl custom chem books are just the big book sliced up
I also am getting the big book
Bc dumb
also why the fuck does chem 142 require 5 fucking books
i figured out how to do it for tuition, but fucking hfs refuses to be fucking normal
<@&574247915518689281> where do we go to manage permissions for hfs payment statements?
I doubt it‚Äôll be too warm for a bit
I heard
I saw people wearing sweaters today and it freaked me out, I love sweater weather but i'm not Ready
You missed the crazy storm yesterday
Rip
I think last week was probably the last time it's gonna hit 70
it's starting to get cold up here and I'm kinda sad
Oh, alright
it's a joke
Awww I'm sorry
which is when you sit on a curb and cry your eyes out
when he wants to be
He's wholesome
"wholesome"
She appreciates his good nature and wholesome personality
I could say something about that but I'm not gonna
Oh man
i appreciate you in other things
:(
Thank you <@173668455856340994>, at least someone appreciates me
Keep em coming üôå
It was a good joke
Yes I agree
aw poor you
I'm sad my joke never got acknowledged
This is an IB 11 History moment right here
When's it due?
yep nvm not taking notes on the whole thing
sounds like it's already fucking you
fuck me it's 40 pages
BRO THIS READING IS SO MUCH LONGER THAN I REALIZED
I need to make friends w someone w a switch
my friends and I are studying together in one of our house lounges but there's two guys playing smash at the TV next to us and it's so distracting lmao
Were they your facial goggles?
we don't talk about it
well
<@340319804747415553> how bad were your freshman chem googles so they needed half an hour of cleaning?
lol idk
I don't think UW's particularly out of line on this one
lmao
Yeah
i used my sister's set
did they?
And tbf, Skyline charged us $15 for those as well
but fuck it
idk if i'm allowed to
It doesn't sound like they're required if you're allowed to bring your own
this is what college is
i just spent half an hour cleaning my freshman year chem goggles bc fuck uw and their 15 dollar required goggles
rip
We're in the Endgame now
Well, I just saw my dad for the last time before I move in
Why charge private-school tuition when you can just make even more expensive textbooks
$$$$$$$$$$$$
why the fuck does uw make custom textbooks
nice
It's back!
is your wifi still down?
I could do so much shit
I want wifi back lol
F
rip
WSU currently
Nah, I enjoy this!
you don't have to keep me company
oh shit your internet is dead LMAO
Sure thing. I might pop out after a few cuz being on data is an L, but it's worth using some for a bit.
aight I'm gonna play music and dance feel free to join me in the channel
It's alright to be dramatic
I should've just come home earlier
lol I'm being dramatic
Awww, I'm sorry, Cindy
sigh
problem: I feel like all my friends who wanted to go out tonight are already gone/there
and is also kinda depressing
I thought about going alone but I was like that defeats the whole point of socialization
If someone's down, by all means, go for it. Otherwise, probably not.
I feel like it's a little late to try to start convincing people to start to go partying
it's a long walk and it's already kinda late
but
context: I have been extraordinarily antisocial all day and I wanna be loud
poll: do I attempt to round up some friends and go partying tonight or do I play my own music and dance alone in my room
i'm not totally sure but i tihnk so
I had no idea they were associated prior to recently
Do they? Cuz that's neat.
i think spotify does that for anyone
usually, stuff isn't left out since it's just a flat discount. hell, spotify throws in a free hulu subscription on top apparently (my mom's been asking me for this one if i don't want it, but i'm still on the fence about it)
it looks the exact same to me. if it's missing something, they're doing damn well to hide it.
amazon student isn't full prime tho right?
oh yeah
a lot of museums and places that require tickets for entry do it. some subscription services (amazon, spotify+hulu, another big one i can't remember) will halve the cost or throw in additional features.
uh, yeah. a lot of things/places have them.
not really? Is that a thing in some places?
cuz mine are. i don't particularly mind, but i find it absolutely hilarious.
out of sheer curiosity, has anyone else's parents been trying to milk their student credentials for student discounts?
Doesn't seem active though
wait wat
Yo I found Mr. Paananen's facebook
never open the windows. in fact, get rid of windows altogether. it'll be like you never left skyline.
you can buy cut to size screens
kinda wanna buy some makeshift mosquito netting or smth
but still
granted, bugs are significantly less bad here
it's just currently only bad on the first floor
also a floor doesn't have a cockroach problem, a building does
your collages cheap out on screens for your windows?
to all three statements
what?
The first floor has a cockroach problem
My room is currently untouched by pests and I try to keep it that way lol
I leave it open anyways
mine doesn't have a screen either
I give the best advice
It opens but bug problems are formidable
Lmao
Find a hammer
Better idea
Jkjk
:o
Turning it off and restarting it
There are no screens on it
Have you tried
I can't open my window
don't know why
well everything has mostly gone quiet now
yes??
do you disagree though?
jane's words not mine
screaming and shitting out the window is "significantly more fun"
doing nothing is also not gonna help
I'm lost
and one is significantly more fun
neither is doing nothing
Yea I don't think that's gonna help
then take a shit out the window
scream out the window louder to assert dominance
And really annoying if you like to have your window open for the fresh air
But it's loud af
I know people wanna party and have fun
Ok Friday nights can be annoying
my first sociology assignment was to watch and take notes on this. goddamn, what a great video
https://www.ted.com/talks/sam_richards_a_radical_experiment_in_empathy?language=en#t-1067962
Not too hard and very useful
Linear is nice
Next semester I'll probably do linear algebra
I'm taking multivariable calc
I got scared off but have no choice
If "hating everything and myself in higher level math but still acing the calc exam and waiving all college math and science" equals getting "scared off" and not just disliking the subject then sure I guess
I'm sorry to hear you got scared off
I'm an ARTS student
I don't speak math anymore
Idr a lot of the substitutions for like trig (like the arcsin and arctan or even a*sin(theta) and stuff
Ngl does anyone still have competent integral skills after the summer
It's a very common Russian name
lol katya's name popped up in my practice set
I'm already kinda bamboozled by the language itself though so uh good luck to me
literally every russian lady I've ever met is such a badass lmao
I LOVE HER
I've only known my russian prof for 2 hours but if anyone happened to her I'd kill everyone in the room and then myself
Lol
Generally I wouldn't suggest smoking a whole bowl too quickly
Severely underestimated how long it would take to demolish a bowl
Now I'm just sitting around waiting
Ok honestly I left my cave too early
Lol
Just ordered ramen I'm so excited
My only class today is at 3:30
Slept in till 10, finished a book, danced around and then took a shower, did some work and then tried to find textbooks for cheaper on amazon
what have you been doing all day?
lol
Finally leaving my dorm at 2 pm lmao
I've been 130 - 135 since freshman year, finally hit 142 this summer (so basically I need to have nothing else to do and focus on eating)
I think I was like barely 100 when I was 12
since I stopped growing
ok nvm that's an exaggeration
I've been sitting at 110-115 pounds for the past like 5 years
I don't gain or lose weight very easily though tbh
I have to eat a lot to stay there (well a lot more than I'm used to)
Yea, I think one of the problems is that 142 just doesn't seem easily sustainable to me
but I eat a ton during said meal so I don't think I've lost weight
tbh I've generally been eating a meal a day
We will see how this goes
So I'm trying to buy all my food at once so I don't just not eat during the day
CONSUME THINGS
What the fuck
And that's impacting the gym
So I've lost 10 pounds since coming to WSU
Lemme shop for my overpriced textbooks in peace goddammit
Bruh my internet is being super fucky today and it's pissing me off
Kinda depressing
That‚Äôs like
Uh
So idk how much is actually being done by the robot's own proccess
They give the bots waypoints every 5 - 10 seconds
actually looked up the article they referenced
*semi* autonomously
Their whole marketing gig is that they run autonomously
I've heard of the bots before
What?
They are on call with the small Colombian kids sitting inside the bots
How does that even work?
Waaaaiiiiit what the fuck??
You can either was a few seconds for them to overcome the stuck bit and pop open or just grab the doors and push them open
So they try to open, crack like 2 inches then stop
Doors on the right elevator started sticking today on our floor
also horrible for sleep
horrible for pics though
I really like bluish white lights
Why do you not have yellow lights in your room at home?
*There are five lights Picard*
I call them interrogation lights
clinical level white lights
Some people care some people dont
you would love my room at home
ah
Personal taste but I hate white lights with a burning passion
why?
Jesus fuck man can you change your lightbulbs by chance?
And my clothes are on the floor because I'm doing laundry
Also yes we are gonna take out the trash and recycling, that's all from today
My solution to my bright monitors when my roommate is trying to sleep
11/10 advertising
the letter is not very clear as to what it is
So maybe?
I still don't know what it is
Oh no
What was the question?
<@&574247915518689281> are you guys going to the convocation thing
no one answered me
also
and yea i have been
because i do those
You watch it I take it
Why are you offended by the truth
and i need someone to talk about it with
i feel like you'd like it
sad
I don't watch TV
<@!258094439636008971> that offends me
Nope
If it's fancy, it isn't necessarily good
do you watch American Ninja Warrior?
NOAH
ALSO
oH
it's fancy
Like how it's fucking unreadable, and even if you could read it, is confusing that no one's gonna even bother to understand what the hell is going on
Have you seen Disney's G
the C just has flourishes
Many things to say about this
He would have
?
@Scott Wang
Fuck is that C though
New Student Convocation and President's Picnic?
**CONVOCATION**
What the fuck does that even say
Maybe I would if I could read what it was
<@&574247915518689281> are any of you going to this?
I have lots of jobs in life
You had one job
I have never been so disappointed in you, Noah
Do I look like I play basketball
I alley-ooped Noah so well, and he basically just caught the basketball and threw it into the stands
`A lot of people say I should model`
I agree with this part
Someone else make the pun because it's weird if I do
There's a difference
A smoking trashcan fire
Inb4 ‚Äúyes‚Äù
No, no
Trash?
Then what does that make me
This just in: Noah thinks I'm a 10
oh hi lol
I agree :)
What are beauty standards
I really don‚Äôt understand it
A lot of people say I should model and I‚Äôm like wtf
Who knows
Lol
I get aggressive compliments on my appearance from various people's Asian parents. Like, way more than they'd give pretty much anyone else. Part of me wonders if I'd be 10 in China or something because of different beauty standards that I'm unaware of.
Wasn‚Äôt usually about clothes but just my physical appearance
She aggressively complimented or criticized parts of my appearance and it was always really really weird
My mom in particular is like the opposite
`I know she theoretically means well`
No she didn't
course
And no worries. It's really awesome to see happy vents now and then. Glad to know we're important enough for you to want to share happy things in life with.
It's really just the truth (at least from my perspective, but if you know me, you know that my opinion is the only one that matters and is rarely wrong). You deserve to hear it as much as anyone.
Is it really support if I'm just stating facts?
gene idk if you know how much your constant support means. spoiler: it's a lot. thanks b. sorry for dropping more text walls into this channel, that was like, a happy vent? I dunno lmao
(Also, I know very few people who have as quality of a sense in fashion as you, so if your mom wants to say otherwise, she needs to rethink a few things)
Cindy, you're amazing, and don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise. I'm really sorry she messed with your head like that. You deserved so much better.
but she has literally no idea how much that kinda stuff fucks with my head
I know she theoretically means well
like for one, I'm actually confident with how I look without her here to shit on my appearance lol. I'm actually pretty damn happy with my body rn, I'm starting to get my abs back and I know I look damn good. I feel like she'd often project shit onto me (i.e. criticizing any flab...) and tell me I shouldn't wear certain things bc they made me ugly/emphasized ugly features (separate from her obsession with middle school dress codes, i.e. she'd tell me to never wear dark or red lipstick because it made my mouth look too big and that's considered ugly in chinese culture, or tell me to never wear low cut tops bc I don't really have boobs)
Does this mean you'll finally believe me now when I say, "YOU'RE A WONDERFUL HUMAN BEING WHO DESERVES THE WORLD AND NEEDS TO STOP BEING SO HARD ON HERSELF"?
idk I feel like I also realized in her absence how many of my insecurities are highkey because of my mom
‚ù§
That sounds awesome. You really deserve this independence after all the shit you had to put up with.
Awww, Cindy, I'm so happy for you!!
I'm not trying to flex and I really hope it's the same for you UW kids when you leave I'm just constantly smiling and dancing and I can do so much that I never could before. there's no more going behind my parents' backs just so I can act like a regular person? no more layering unnecessary sweatshirts to escape the house with an off-shoulder top, no more lying to say I've been at home all day, no more sneaking out through the side door of my garage to get out when everything's suffocating. it's a crazy feeling, not being constantly afraid
Glad you‚Äôre *thriving*
Nice
being away from my family has been SO GOOD to me
idk where to put this, and I start class tomorrow so this might come to an abrupt end, but as of right now, aside from missing y'all like crazy, I'm literally so happy
That sounds like a worrisome rule of thumb but take care of yourself lol
K note to self follow the other people
Oh I'm supposed to walk THROUGH this sketchy construction area
Honestly, maybe you were right earlier and just didn't realize
That's valid. Go do that.
4th time??
Holdup I actually need to map this
Bro where the fuck am I
I thought it was like 2AM?
I think my problem is that my peak energy level happens at like 8-12 pm
Go home and get some rest
Awww
I'm literally so disoriented
Third time's a charm
We stan an icon
Fuck I walked in the wrong direction again LMAO
Regardless of what Noah might tell you
That's fine, but don't push yourself to the point of pain
Idk like I'm excited to suddenly have access to so many cheap or free exercise options
Take it easy on yourself when you get the chance
Aww, Cindy
My whole body hurts again
I should chill
Pt 10000 of Cindy is a dumbass
Ripperoni
Also I just realized I walked in the exact opposite direction as I was supposed to go lmao
Embrace the chlorine into your eyes
Wow I need goggles I forgot how much this stings
I was thinking 3'
I'm stupid
Oh wait
By that I mean under 5 feet
Ah
I mean that is starting with 4'
For me I think tiny tiny starts at -7" to -9"
I thought you ment just people that were short
That's a whole different thing
Oh you mean midgets
My personal benchmark is for guys if your height starts with 4'
Idk if being half a foot shorter is tiny tiny
So -6" in both cases
Averages are 5' 9" and 5' 6"
Because if it is then 5' for a girl is as well
is 5' 3" for a guy tiny tiny?
And so is Thao kinda
She and Mia are smol
Like 5‚Äô yeah
Or tiny tiny
5 foot tiny?
Also fucking tiny
she‚Äôs fucking gorgeous and super nice
I could never
But like yeah she like highlights for the gods, curls her hair, and fake lashes basically everyday
Please drown
Have fun Cindy
I get up and hour and a half before my classes
Jarrett be quiet
Hopefully I meet more people ttyl babes
Aight I gotta go I'm actually gonna go swim by myself lol
How woman have time for lot makeup in morning?

Straight men don‚Äôt have the best track record with dancing lets be real
Wait what
Lmao
Yet here we are
Never thought that I‚Äôd be the one picking up the guy
I‚Äôm waiting to pick up noah
Straight men are so awkward when I try to get them to platonically dance w me smh
Also
He actually dances
Sounds like an oxymoron
Plenty of room in my cold shriveled heart
Will do and I could never replace y'all I'm still spam texting you from here lol
He sounds like a fun guy
Destroy the straights
Jkjk send him my love
The gay agenda is being realized
I‚Äôm being replaced
Damn i thought you were gonna be burying bodies with me
P sure they think he's a serial killer and I the sidekick
They just stared at him for like a solid 2 min it was so funny but also so bad lmao
Nice
At one point we were in an elevator and I was talking about getting a fridge and he made a joke about killing his roommate and hiding the body in it right as some other people walked in
No ok we've been bitchy together it's all good
wow
Damn
Ah so basically he doesn't know you that well
He's the cutest my heart's gonna burst
But yeah my friend is fucking hilarious and a huge sweetheart like literally everyone adores him so idk what else the issue could be
Yea
Ah makes sense
And by half I mean he grew up there, not just ancestry wise
Oof
I'm pretty sure he's mildly homophobic and transphobic, I even pointed out he makes a lot trans jokes and he got very defensive
Also he's half Russian and Ukrainian, so all the stuff that comes with that
Men
*lotion*
Hey my roommate made fun of me for using lotion
But I mean yeah you won't be sure unless you talk to them
Imo it was p obvious for him bc he's super soft spoken and like a Pretty Boy and has a 12-step skincare routine that he adheres to religiously like he's way better about it than me lol
Not to be stereotypical, but you can normally tell
Talk to them
Dunno how yall can tell the difference between straight and gay people
Did the man like announce that he's gay or something?
so even if homophobia isn't the case it's still a rip
like he made my friend buy the wifi router for their room and has ignored him since
basically the dude's been super nice and friendly to basically everyone else but legit won't speak to him. also he's pretty religious and has shit like "bless this home" on the walls so uh
no but he's gonna try to talk to him tonight
As anyone asked the roommate if he's homophobic?
it's an L
he's trying to move out
ok this is a huge stereotype but I made a Gay Best Friend and we're 90% sure his roommate is highkey homophobic
yeah fair enough
I just don't agree with them
They don't affect me
So I'll keep my thoughts on his thoughts to myself
Cause I got a year with him, I'm not gonna piss him off right now
Mostly because I'm very diplomatic when needed
We get along pretty well though
Mark just needs to stop hating the world
Mason is literally always stoned so it wrappes back around to I can't even tell when he's stoned
Ben is great to be around when not in frat boy mode
I've found that a lot of frat guys are actually super nice, just too far into the "frat life" for my taste
Clay is quiet and reserved, he basically never smokes, thoughtful guy as well, I like him
yeah
Ben is really chill and nice when he's just out and about, he smokes lightly with Mason, also a big gym guy 
But when he goes frat mode I can't stand being around him, he drinks, takes adderall, and smokes, and as I already told you I can't be around people if nobody's home
Mason smokes like crazy, his lips might as well be permanently attached to some form of smoking device, which he as many of
riperoni. y'all are chill w living with each other though right?
Roommate is a nice guy but wayyy to negative towards people and life in general, the world is stupid and out to get him in his view
Roommate, stoner, frat boy, stoners cousin
Mark, Mason, Ben, Clay are the main people I hangout with
No
have you found anyone you really like?
you should tell me about your new friends
But someone people still make it back to the door bathroom
Basically the furthest dorm on campus from it
Like we are a 15 min walk from Greek row
oh god
Votmit, diarrhea, and pissing all over the floor
I'm sure it'll happen at some point but it hasn't yet and I'm p good at controlling myself
idk the idea of getting full-on wasted does not really appeal to me
Someone keeps trashing the same toilet
oof
And this is the tail end of the second week of school
But we have people and friends showing up wasted to our floor still
Which is the first week
Specifically sylubus week
Lol, WSU is like that, but also for the first two weeks because "the first two weeks of class don't matter"
I at least will def calm down in like a week
my friends and I kinda have the mentality of like let's live it up now while everything's free and before class actually starts
people do it anyways at parties n such though and like I wanna dance so
I don't really care, most of the places you can smoke are pretty intentionally secluded
I don't like the smell of weed or cigarettes
I like that you can't smoke on campus at all
That seems annoying
also it's legal across canada I believe
Wait really?
so most of campus is clear
ah. the rule here is you have to be a certain distance from buildings
Not that they listen
So just smoke off campus
But campus if federal
I mean it's legal in Washington too
it's legal here
yeah but only in specific spots
Can you guys smoke on campus?
I'm sure you understand why lol
there's this one grove of trees on campus that's referred to as "the magic forest"
Walking them through the weeds more like
Nature walks lol
I'll accompany them on "nature walks" and talk
Lmao ripppp
I try to avoid being in enclosed spaces when others are smoking
Yea I can imagine that
and it wasn't even any of my friends just other people
I'm starting to think I've been getting a mild secondhand high from people smoking around me though bc highkey my memory was kinda fuzzy
when we went out on wed i didn't drink at all, it was kinda surreal
yeah
Which isn't inherently bad, I just don't want to partake
rip
It's difficult to find anyone social that doesn't smoke weed a ton or drink a ton
but I also feel like that's more expected
yeah I feel
It feels weird to have all white people
I'm in vancouver
you're at wsu
I have no Asian friends
I have yet to meet another east asian IR major
I keep accidentally ending up with groups of brown people actually lol but they're a lot of fun so it's not like I mind
even though there's like a lot of them
very few of my friends here are east asian
you know what's surprised me?
I literally barely have anything that's metal
Leave magnets on random ass metal objects around the room
boooo
Get command strips and stick magnets to wall <@503787499605458954>
Better than nothing I guess?
It takes I think 3 years to count
I would assume so??
fuck if I know lol
Out of sheer curiosity, if a student a state school originally applied and attended as an out-of-student but started living in said state in the summer and became a legal resident, would they eventually start paying in-state tuition?
<@193229269076279298> if we didn't love you, would Jiayi and I really have sent you dick pics?
jk ily
yeah the personality of a bitchass
^
it's just a shitty one
I have personality
hey
I think I have the most varied interests though
like at all
ok that's not true
You have more personality than all the rest of us combined lol
lol
Just lose the arm, not the personality, is what I'm saying
You have a personality. Bucky does not.
I have the MOST personality tyvm
your lack of faith in me is disturbing
excuse you
Actually have a personality though please thanks
note to self: become the winter soldier
Severely injure yourself to either get metallic fillings (I think that's the term?) somewhere in your bone structure or just get a metallic prosthetic limb and stick the magnets to yourself
‚ù§
‚ÄúNeed to help a friend find something to do with her magnets‚Äù
‚ÄúNothing to see here‚Äù
maybe I'll just get another whiteboard lmao
I should try to cross the border with a hunk of iron
what's like a wall thing I could buy that would work
Sigh
Basically a kiddie chair
all I have is my desk chair and it's plastic
Like metal chairs
??
Chairs?
didn't bring one, mooching off of lena
Fridge?
Awww
idk what I'm gonna do with the fuckload of magnets I brought anymore lol
the whiteboard in my dorm isn't magnetic this is so disappointing
Damn
I'm SORRY
Cindy is a liar and never played ow with us, from what I remember
Noah is a bitch ~~most of the time~~ sometimes, from what I remember
Jiayi likes his Hentai, from what I remember
Jarrett's a pretty chill guy, from what I remember
I mean it's technically true
I should add that modifier to everyone I describe
Oh nice. She's p nice, from what I remember
I hung out w her for a bit last night, we're not super close though
oh btw <@!520095106888630348> alex remembers you!
Yes
bc water might've been unclean
didn't people drink alcohol way more than water in the medieval/ancient times
It's  called "How Beer Saved the World"
lmaoooo
This is amazing
The documentary is sponsored by them
And it's sponsored by Coors Light
We're watching a documentary in class on the history of beer
does anyone wanna video call me later tonight I miss y'all
also I'm not going to the football game later that's like A Lot for me I think I'm gonna head to the gym instead
but so did everyone
mostly bc I skipped everything lmao
I actually have a chill day today!!
I think that counts as a fetish
A hoarder of girls that are blond, buff, and taller than her
This classifies Helen as a hoarder
Nah man i just need one
A five person poly relationship seems very hard to handle
Yeah Jesus Helen save some for the rest of us
4 sounds like a bit much
Lol
Helen is taking all the tall girls
?
Ahh so that's it
Never mind
Question
Randomly relevant
it's an interesting experience
suddenly i'm the short one lol
what i mean is 4 of 26 girls being taller than me by such a large margin is statistically very unlikely
Super buff?
and blonde
and they're super buff too
but i mean all of them are that tall
So idk if 6' is that crazy
I mean Salina is 5' 11"
jk lol
Also do I have a lot to say about height?
<@!340319804747415553> what's your opinion
haha
As in I don't have pants on right now
And pants are optional
Yea our floor is all boys, and it's hot right now
So it's no shirt all the time for me
i see noah typing, im sure you have a lot to say about height
but here all four of the rowers are like 6 feet
i'm usually used to being like 90-95% percentile height among any group of girls
these rowers are so tall
i live in a girls-only side of the floor (didn't ask for it but there are some perks, like walking in the hallways in only underwear or changing with the door open) that contains about 26 people. Sports teams are always dorming together, for example all the rowers are in my dorm
Basically I'm at UW
Advising and Orientation
A&O?
So seeing them
I'm at A&O
what spawned this thought?
There is a large abundance of cute girls here
Bless the west coast
but still
I guess if I decide later if I really wanna take business math I can skip to calc 3 level
like what even was the point
I have unused ap and ib math credit, I literally didn't need it for anything
I'm annoyed @ myself for putting in so much effort for math
nice nice
Out of 100 or so
I only had 15 credits that weren't really worth anything
I'm actually pretty happy with how my credit transferred, even though it was initially set up for UW
aw rip
Also throw in going through medical hell
oof
oh
It's loads of fun
Try taking two languages at once
Corrected
oh
how did I not know that
No
you know french??????
I get credit for 2
I took 5 years of French and 3 years of German
not that it matters since I'm taking russian anyways
and I find it really funny that my 4 years of spanish don't count for shit but my half-assed attempt at ap chinese is letting me waive my language req
also I have 40+ credits from ib/ap but only about half actually apply to useful things for me which is sad
yeah but like suppose 2 people both have straight Bs, their individual % averages across classes will determine who comes up on top
Which is nicer than letter grades to GPA
At UW they do 0 - 4.0 in increments of 0.1
GPA just is for some reason in blocks rather than granular
Shouldn't they be the same
?
we have the 4 point scale but %s matter more
gpa is weird up here
I just need an average 3.2 across a few specific engineering classes and I'm guaranteed my spot
Wow, that sounds like lots of fun
I need at least an 80 avg possibly higher
so
I'm direct admit but it's a super competitive program
I literally only know three ways to get kicked out of my major, academic probation, cheating, and breaking the law
Why?
I'm in an arts advising lecture rn and I'm so anxious lmao there are so many ways I could get kicked out of my major
yeah that's crazy
woah that's like a month away
yikerooni
25th
wait <@&574247915518689281> when do our CLASSES actually start?
i don't think you're allowed a calculator
I think I brought a scientific and it wasn't allowed, but it's been a while
I don't think so?
Like a graphing one
O shit do i need a calculator?
Depending on your calculator skills
Often faster than actual solving
My fav
Pull some SAT work-backwards shit
Multiple choice too
Nice
Aight
Hell, you're allowed to retest if you care that much
i wouldn't stress out about it
just do your best, worst case scenario you have a bad day and bomb it and then take an easier math class
Trig, systems of equations, exponential functions, expontent rules, etc.
it's eh
It's pre-calc
Math aint hard is it?
<@&574247915518689281> I have A&O tomorrow
Gonna derail this real quick
<@193229269076279298> Yes, a college education is valuable, almost required, but that doesn't justify being able to run rampant with prices from a moral standpoint. Of course college are gonna do it regardless, but that doesn't mean it's not problematic. It's like charging people a high price for utilities. There are *technically* other options (I could just not use the internet without going to the library for example), but it's not influential enough to drive down the market.
Which isn't good
is that supposed to be a good thing
50% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck
Again, if the college is getting the money, even if it's from loans a student is forced to take out from the price tag, they really don't care. It's terrible for the economy, but it maxes out their profit. Ultimately, they're responsible for their own profit margin, not the rest of the economy, as dickish and problematic as it is.
so if you're 30 and paying off your student loans, your mortgage, and your car loan at the same time, you're in a yike situation
it's not setting you up to be financially stable, it's setting you up to be in debt until you're 40
it's just not good for the economy for people to start off in their adult lives _so far_ in debt
unless their parents are well off enough
college students at most have an income of minimum wage, like 20 hours a week
This let's you be financially stable
car and house you get when you HAVE a high paying job, or at least get one that matches how much you make
Or at least have income
right but you do that when you're financially stable
School, car, house, etc
If they're still getting enough 60k payments to fill out all the seats, they're fine. There's no reason to raise the price tag unless you can't enroll enough people. They don't really care that some people can't afford it as long as enough people can.
You're gonna have to take on loans multiple times in your life realistically
but your target demographic is people who largely don't have the money to pay for it
but you slap a 60k price on it because they need it and they sorta have to
You won't be able to buy everything in life with cash
like if you know your target demographic is billionaires, yea pimp it out and then put a 60k price tag on it
And don't really care as long as they get paid
Because they can
my question is why are you demanding this much money from people who don't have high paying jobs yet
I can get a job at Space X for 120,000 a year right out of college, I wouldn't be making 60,000 a year out of highschool
Unless you don't have 60k to begin with
Actually it's pretty reasonable
60,000 for the benefit it can offer isn't that crazy
that's still p expensive
You can get your first two years there, and then transfer  for you last two
It's like if tap water was unsafe to drink and water bottles are being sold at $5 a bottle. It's still worth it because you need it, and while the price is understandable because of the undrinkable state of tap water, it's still kinda pricey for what it is.
Community colleges are much cheaper
Price isn't fixed
We do though
because we kinda need it
I'm not saying it's not worth it, but a lot of the reason it is worth it is because of how little say in the matter we have to begin with
if they doubled the price of tuition to what it is now we'd p much all still go
i mean obviously it's worth it for most people, like hey i'm choosing to go to college and i'm paying for some of it, but it's sort of like a monopoly were i don't really get any say in the price
fair enough
but i digress
coffee, maybe, but i don't drink it
i feel like that's more likely than sparkling water
i doubt they have free milk
_milk_
didn't think of that
that's a good one actually
it has its uses, but drinking it straight it kinda yike
PROTEIN SHAKE
It's the default
i was trying to come up with something that wasnt water but still healthy
They seem to think everyone wants to drink it
Don't go to Europe then
look, man
it is unless you're mixing it
^
Sparkling water is DISGUSTING
sparkling water
uh
watch me drink all the free
no, no
<@!193229269076279298> that's fair enough, and i'm not saying it isn't worth it because, with how the current job market is set up, you kinda need a college degree as a pre-requisite for a lot of jobs. but the price is somewhat inflated due to demand. granted, if you were to cut that out, it'd still be expensive, but the ideas still stands
Drink water
It will be bad for your health
Don't

"Please take note that the free beverages and Husky Meal discounts that residents on dining levels 1‚Äì6 enjoy are not available when you use your Husky Card Account."
when you use up your meal plan you can use your husky card
Yea but that's the risk you're taking
yeah, jane?
The college just said "sure we'll teach you that"
it's still no guarantee. the market could crash.
oh so gene
You chose your major
It's up to you to use it
doesn't always work out for everyone
*potential benefit
Is it really a scam if you get so much benefit from it?
which is what often feels like a scam
but certification is mainly expensive because the demand for it is so high
but beyond that, i agree
well, you're also paying in time. i feel like it's not purely certification cuz you're still going there to learn
Because they're putting their name on all your work
Certification is expensive
In engineering if you want a piece of material it's 1, if you want the material with a cert it's x5
Yes, you're paying them to certify you to the standard
but first give the university thousands of dollars
the piece of paper can get you a job interview
Very useless in others
Very helpful in someways
It's a baseline standard
It serves the very important purpose of every single person with this peice of paper knows at least "this" minimum about what they studied
it is but they also want to suck every penny they can get out of you
it's a very important scam
It's like standards
College is important
Hey
College is a scam
it is
i feel like this whole thing is just really untransparent, so idk at this point
you can change your meal plan to go up at any point but you can't go down
this wasn't mentioned to me
tho if you want that then you can add money? I think it's change your meal plan
I assume UW is the same
At WSU you get a 40% discount on meal plan money
thanks for passing on the info
well, fair enough i guess
this is what my brother ~~forced me~~ told me to do because it's "smarter"
isn't meal plan money cheaper though? i thought it was more expensive to add (unless i was fucking lied to, which i would not be surprised by at all)
or just pay for meals on your own
no chance of leftover money and you get more options of places to eat after you get rid of your meal plan money
get a level 1, add money if you need it
Oh same for WSU
we're required to
I didn't get one
<@&574247915518689281> what are y'all's meal plans? cuz i'm thinking of changing mine lol
uh huh
*mild*
Mild impact loading
:/
Roll them off the bed then make it
lol
Burrito the old person
and a lot of rolling ppl
its a long process
Well does your book have an answer?
So I've done it/had it done to me
And a dog
old people
ok but
I have siblings
Just do one side then walk around to the other side then reach around the person and pull it so it slides under them
it's not very hard
Oh wait I understand
yes
Is this a current problem?
I'm confused as to how to make a bed while no one's on it lmfaooo
this isn't what i went to school for
i'm confused as to how to make a bed while someone is on it
See I'm right
guys
that's simply unacceptable
i love democracy
gasp
democracy?
oh my gosh
Democracy
ur mum
what form of degeneracy is noah suggesting this time?
hi i just walked on this conversation
don't do anything too stupid
enjoy your hookups or relationships or whatever
Democracy
noah stahp
let's not
I suggest you ask us to vote on your actions for the optimal results
have fun
oh boi
lol
btw, the friend who was also a friend-of-a-friend knows thrisha from mun, I'm tired of listing out the friend of a friend thing and salina at least knows who that is
both the thai girl I was talking about earlier and the friend who knew one of my friends are smoking hot and exactly my type and idk what to do or how to feel about it lol
I left your sorry asses behind for college classes
but I was gonna say
improve your classic literature game
i'm making you read it
you uneducated heathen

I'm lost
sorry sorry
maybe destroy a few lives on the way
ok tea
LMAO

How hilly is UBC?
i dont wanna read more about making beds
I've been walking basically as much as if I were hiking

I'm like physically exhausted
I'm surprisingly pretty awake rn

psych has also been a v popular choice from what I've seen but one of the upperclassmen I was chatting with (psych/socio major) said that like 70% of people drop out after first year lol
yea lol
neuro claims many the unfortunate soul
gl
ah
neuroscience
what's she majoring in anyway
fun
she brought cah
though, I got her to hang out w my new friends today which was lit
and I barely see melena even though she's my roommate which is unfortunate
like I'm basically never in my room except to crash
also like I'm hoping things will calm down after the first week of class but as of rn I have a sad lack of chill time in my life
jkjk
... no
are you sure?
one of those is not like the others
...............
Bolt, stud, screw, duck penis, etc
basically a screw
oh
but what's a threaded fastener
pardon the stupid
i need a new boyfriend that speaks less nerd lmao
Wayyy more complicated than you'd think
...
Nope, favorite thing I've read in the last few years was a chapter in an engineering book on "threaded fasteners"
<@!503787499605458954> lmao oh dear god that quiplash round was cursed
lol
nvm
is that a metaphor or what
And people will pay you to do it
Much easier
I suggest you all instead extract enjoyment for making a solid well designed bolted connection that resists fatigue failure
like it's been so easy to make friends which is super nice but I need to actually like actively try to meet people and hang out w em
literally this whole week before class starts is just a huge socialization thing
me: :/
me: reading lesson section on the importance of sleep
i'm ashamed of u

taking care of my (unfortunate) need for human interaction
I am taking care of myself

Why not?
Lol
You'll be perfectly happy to suck my dry until I collapse, then go find another wallet to leech

Hey stop complaining
however,
i don't need a glucose deficient sugar daddy
y'all are worth it
I'm honestly jealous of your ability to forget about food
really
take care of yourself, guys
It takes a lot of time to stop and eat
noah
....
Don't judge me
bruh
Then classes started and food is always the first thing I give up on
I was really proud of myself for actually eating enough during move in week
Lol
just been ditching during breaks to crash
lol
food here is disgustingly good
dw I'm still eating well
I've lowkey been skipping meals to nap between sessions lmao
ok mood
i'm just dead by the end
but also i get home and nap
now that i'm driving alone

awww im sorry, guys
I tapped out early today
Except 2 - 3 is more common
Seems accurate from my experience
Yep
I've now kinda just accepted that if I wanna have a social life I'm never gonna sleep before 1
#publicart
I can just hear him
Idk, can't tell his success rate
classy
You can hear it
There is someone outside my dorm picking up chicks with a Megaphone
<@&532797605831245845> why do we make public art?
Intresting looking piece
Just came across this thing
I've actually never seen someone use it
Na like no one ever uses it
Is it shared by the whole building? Cuz if so, isn't it gonna like always be in use?
Yea we have a full kitchen on the ground floor
if yes Im jealous
do you have a legit one?
it does in one of the lounges but no stoves
Not all dorms do
Your dorm doesn't have a kitchen?
Ooo nice
Also, I have two bottles of maple syrup and a box of those maple cookies lying around somewhere
I have an instant pot and I made friends in ritz (dorm with kitchens)
Bc I wanna cook
Why would you bring it if they have it there already?
I love this shit
I fed you maple cookies
I brought a bottle to school with me lmao
I'm listening
Listen
I'm not complaining I just find it really funny
They'll revoke your citizenship if you don't
Maple is amazing
Real question is why are you complaining
You must embrace it
You should expect it
You should know this
You're Canadian, why are you surprised?
I swear to god everything is maple flavored here
This feels like high school chem
Last class I walked out of unit conversations
Ripperoni but respect
Lmao
So I just walked out at this point
I've already done 2/3 of the class before
I feel like they're obligated to check if there's anyone who doesn't already know how sig figs work
I already took 141 and 161, but they count for basically nothing
I can't take the 5th time learning sig figs
I'm so sorry
Fucking chem
Dude
But speaking of coffee, my family's kinda wack in that they're like, "oh, yeah, don't drink coffee lmao" but then they keep pressuring me to drink alcohol, and it's kinda weird
I can't take it
Ok I just walked out of Chem
Dw
I was always late to school, 7-8 showers don't actually work
9-10 is chill
over the summer though like I have taken morning showers
I could never shower in the morning when school started at 7-8
I shower in the morning so I was awake enough to not crawl back into my bed before school
that's just unfair
Well I've never had a problem with either
damn ok
Abd maybe mid day shower if I'm feeling it
and skin
but that's bad for your hair
but now I like don't have a schedule at all I just do it when I feel like it
I just do both
I'll feel a little gross without a morning shower, but it's not a pre-req
ok I used to be a hardcore night-time showerer
lmao
My day cannot start until I take a shower
For me it's showers
As Courtney famously put it, "if I don't like you without your coffee, I don't like you as a person because I'm really just speaking to a caffeine addiction"
I would probably never say that completely unironically but it's kinda true sometimes
lol
Also, I don't wanna be the asshole in an office 8 years from now who says some edgy bullshit like "you don't like me when I haven't had my coffee don't talk to me yet"
I'm 80% immune. both times were all-nighters where I had like 4+ shots
Last time was before I went skydiving
I rarely drink coffee
I've experieced a legit caffeine crash like twice ever
^
Tea is more than enough caffeine for me

I can't focus with caffeine in my system and then crash in an hour
I just want a blood sugar spike and caffeine to make ending it all slightly less attractive
Why isn't most rootbeer caffeinated
I crash really fucking fast
Caffeine just flat out does not work well for me
I really don't want that much caffeine in my system. I feel bad after drinking caffeinated soda sometimes.
That's why I do it
Or you just don't care and want caffeine
but black coffee is amazing
Black tea is different
I've learned that the only two purposes of drinking black coffee are attempting to blend in with lumberjacks and when you're trying to impress someone on a first date with a meaningless act that will ultimately backfire because you can't drink black coffee
I only drink black coffee and black tea
Yes
The only time I was like "thank God for coffee" was at a LAN event
Am I really gonna drink black coffee?
Yeah but let's be real
also if you take it straight it's p good for you
tbh I mostly drink it for the taste
Lmao
are you even a seattle native
Oh
Smoking coffee beans, no
I think I had a sip when I was a kid
you've never tried it??????????????
The most exposure I've had to coffee is coffee flavored ice cream
Gonna by a "herb" grinder and smoke them eventually
ever tried choc covered coffee beans? they're so fuckin good
I wanna be there to see this happen
Lemme know if you ever decide to
my favorite perfume has coffee in it
it would be more pleasant than cocaine
I love the smell
honestly probably
Soo I take it you're almost at the stage of snorting beans?
so is tim hortons actually but that's less of a coffee place and more of a food place
dunkin is weak
lil piece of home
also everyone here prefers starbucks over local chains and it makes my heart happy
nitro cold brew is SO GOOD
ok but
Ah, same
like it doesn't make me more hyper or energetic it just makes me less likely to fall asleep
well caffeine has never been super effective on me tbh but also, yes.
You probably have a tolerance to it at this point
I literally just had coffee why am I still so sleepy
I honestly stick too many things in my pockets. This is why I need that messenger bag.
Well, if it works, it works
Looks like a peice of armor plating
But it looks really funny when she has her phone in there
Wait that's iconic
Her bra literally has pockets for it
Mostly for running
Lol, that's what my mom does all the time
not ideal to say the least
when I REALLY need to I'll stick things in my bra but I mean
Pockets are practical but sacrifice comfort
Which is why they're my favorite
Because all my favorite gym shorts have no pockets
My solution has always been to just tuck it into my waistband
Ah, yes
lack of pockets
also
I'm thinking of just buying a men's wallet
false, girls' wallets are typically clutches
I'm confused
Uh a wallet is smaller than basically any bag
like last night I had this tiny shoulder bag with just my id, debit card, $20 cash and keys
no, bc sometimes I wanna bring a smaller bag/purse so I'll take only what I need
Do you not just keep everything in your wallet?
it's like 20-30 min driving but easily an hour by bus
Oof that's fair. Public transportation is not fun.
I REALLY wish my parents let me bring my car
idk when I'm gonna find the time to go into the city to do that though
I have to open a new account anyways actually
Although if you can't find it, you might wanna just cancel it since it's a debit card
I'm sure it'll turn up if it's in your room
and idk what the fuck is up with that either bc I know I had it when I got to my room
proof: currently, I cannot find my canadian debit card
Don't be too hard on yourself.
I am a dumbass and I embrace it
You're not a dumbass. It happens, Cindy. I'm just glad you found it and everything worked out alright.
long story short I'm a dumbass and y'all already knew
Damn
anyways that's my midday life update that nobody asked for
(I'm mostly joking I had a grand total of 2 drinks and felt fine, I feel like everything was more from sleep deprivation than alcohol)
I stumbled into the bathroom like when she was about to leave and she was like ".......you ok"
I really hope I didn't wake my roommate up lmao I was not hungover but was legit dead this morning
when I got back at like 2 am
I also distinctly remember dropping my google home mini to the loudest fucking crash possible
maybe I was drunker than I thought last night bc it was stuck in a random boot for some godforsaken reason
hoes I woke up panicking at 8 today bc I could not find my student id
*doubtfulness intensifies*
I'm very clearly a hetero sapien
That's fair enough
Just made it more clear that I'm not calling you a Homo
Eh
The edit didn't change the message
Stop editing I'm getting confused
Oh
You know it ;)
~~No~~ Homo
<3
Ok, I really sidetracked, but again, love you, Noah. I won't go on any further about that unless you want me to since you seem a little further out of sad boi hours, but the point still stands.
Or how he handed the hardware engineers his research on why consumers disliked the Xbox One prior to launch after paying him a shit ton of money to conduct it and then they basically threw it away because they disagreed that the product was flawed because they made it/it was their baby, so it couldn't possibly fail
I vividly remember this one time my brother went off about how a programmer at Microsoft spent 3 months rewriting code to decrease a 2-minute load time by like 4 seconds
So the only worse scenario is management sucks
And they're the first in line after management
Shit engineers make everyone down the chain suffer
He can be technically seen as an engineer himself depending on how you want to view his job
He differentiates between good ones and the ones he thinks are shit, but yeah
Ah so he doesn't like engineers
I'm really sorry you're in the situation you're in, Noah. I really hope it gets better. I really do. You're a hard-working guy with a good heart, and that's really hard to say about a lot of people. You deserve better, but I promise it'll come your way in the future because I really believe you have it in you to do amazing things. For now, just know that we're here to support you and hope the present starts giving you the pleasant surprises you deserve soon enough.
Anyways, sorry to sidetrack
He really dislikes 95% of Microsoft engineers for a wide assortment of reasons, and it's kinda funny
He works on some pretty cool stuff (see: Xbox adaptive controller), but he has plenty of stories where he just complains about Microsoft engineers for hours on end
That fuckin reminds me of you riding your bike carrying a printer strapped to your back
He's a UX researcher. It's literally his job to complain about this shit.
Why?
I've been going through the rulebook and other people's designs for two years now, along with making my own ideas along the way
I still think it's really cool though
Ok, I'll make sure you never talk to my brother so he doesn't attempt to beat your ass for this idea
Well
Didn't realize
Oh, mb
This is an FSAE car
"Usability"
Hey, that sounds really awesome!
Usability gang unite
But less cramped
I think that'd be super cool!
FSAE style
I want to build a car
Oh, my bad
(also: if you wanted to, you could try to join the workforce after your bachelor's before attempting your master's. It's a popular route, and some companies will help pay tuition. But that's a 2021 problem)
Oh the car thing is an engineering project
Noah, if you want it in a positive light, I'm basically saying I'm believing in you. This might be silly, but to a certain extent in this situation, success is almost a given (or at least as close as it's gonna get). You're going to do well when it comes to pursuing engineering as long as you still want to and keep pushing through. I'm basically saying that, understanding that that's gonna work out, consider the other things you want out of life. The car things a good start, but I don't think that should be it. Some short-term stuff would be nice. For the love of god, don't stop with your engineering projects if you still love them because that part of what makes you so amazing at what you do. But even when you work, know you're only gonna be working 8 hours a day (hopefully) and will have shifting interests throughout your life. Learning to fill those other hours outside of sheer productivity with the understanding that the time is fluid would be nice, especially since your next two years seem very fluid.
I feel like I may have actually stumbled upon something there isn't porn of
Now I kinda want to see if someone's done a porno with a CNC machine
2 fun things
2 in 1
I mean you could do CNC with a CNC machine, it just wouldn't care, it would be all down to the coder
Well if I've learned anything from my dad it's airplane leases are 200 pages long because 150 of those pages are because of someone getting fucked
So I propose we make BDSM contracts with the same level of detail and care, slap dat ass, put it in the log book, leave a biet mark, log book
Actually now I'm just getting side tracked
Why the fuck does reddit's search engine know I'm looking for CNC machines as a subreddit but still show me Consent Non Consent posts, like what's the over lap with those things
always
also
By all means, he should take every opportunity to do what he wants to do with engineering, but if he hits a roadblock, he's free to chill if he needs time to let them pass
were you referring to the car goal
Anyone want to hear my BDSM joke?
oh wait
no I know I meant the side projects
Still got a long way to go through
He's being limited in what he can do
I've been working on that goal for 2 years already
if engineering stuff makes you happy do that
(I've also seen this with Midwest white men cuz I meet all sorts of people through my brother lmao)
I kinda disagree with gene's general sentiment, I don't think you necessarily need to do something else/more
Like my long term goal is to have a car by the end of my masters
That's why my side quests are currently crazy ass engineering stuff
I'm correct because I said you're correct
You are correct <@258094439636008971>
Source: I've seen a lot of people in their late 20s/early 30s who've spent a long time trying to land their dream jobs and then drift off in confusion cuz they realized the only thing ever pushing them along was Asian parents and their bosses
Yep
Oh it's arrived
Hey yeah dont misinterpret my kind words
I was gonna start making some BDSM jokes
I don't think you're wrong at all, and I don't wanna sugarcoat it. WSU is definitely an odd fit for you, and as far as bumps in the road goes, this is a pretty frustrating one. I'm not really suggesting you to take this like the "opportunity of the college experience" or whatever bullshit someone wants to use to describe the freedom college typically offers you. Simply put, with what little WSU is currently offering you, you're "stuck" in the sense that it isn't actively pushing you along to where you want to be. You have a great vision for where you want to be in the future, and you're "stuck" because you've outgrown a lot of the resources being given to you. If this is a video game, now's a good-ass time to take a sidequest. Maybe it'll help you in the future, maybe it won't. But hopefully, it'll be fun and make time go by a little faster. I promise you you're gonna get where you want to go as long as you still want to follow your goals. Don't feel pressured to solely looks for opportunities to pursue them just because they're clear. You got a lot of life to live, even after you've gotten a job.
LOL
Ah, that's what you're talking about
Or at least you got good direction
Very motivated
Thank you
Noah you're well put together
Not without written consent documents
No
HIT ME BABY ONE MORE TIME
GIVE ME A SIGNNNNNN
when I'm not with you I lose my mind
I still believe (still believe)
and I must admit
is killing me
my loneliness
Don't feel the need to rush
That's a joke
lmfao
Hit me with it faster
Hit me with it
Noah, do you mind if I be a bit blunt about this? I know it's not usually like me, but it sounds like you might wanna hear it
That's fair enough lmao
Really chill stoner guy I hang out with on my floor (I feel like chill goes with the stoner territory)
Who's Mason?
But in the wrong way
Maybe Mason is right
It's really alright
I'm just a ball of sunshine
About accurate
Transferred, lost all my friends, and never even wanted to be here in the first place
It's ok, you don't need to apologize. I get it. It's like entering your junior year in another college. You basically transferred
I just trying to explain why college really isn't a great fit for me
I'm not complaining about you guys enjoying yourself
It's alright
nah I get it
That sounds insulting
Sorry
I kinda already had those
Over your time and your life
Yea cause you guys are gaining something by leaving high school, more freedoms
but at the end of the day I'm primarily here to learn and make valuable connections
I do want to get the most out of the "college experience", as cliche as it is. I was honestly miserable for most of high school and I've always thought I would like this kind of environment a lot more, and so far, I'm proving myself right
anyways i was gonna say
all good
(sorry to interrupt you, Cindy)
noah can do what he wants, and he says he only really wants to work
Massive, easy, lot of work
I highly don't suggest gen requirement classes
Just because it's the clearest career path doesn't mean it should have to be the only thing in his life. I'm just saying it's worth taking some more time to do some non-career things since that seems like it might benefit your current situation. Granted, you know your situation than me, but that was just my line of thought. If life was all about our goals, it'd look a lot different.
idk if I can word this properly but like
I think noah has the clearest career path by far
Yea I already cleared most of my basic requirement classes already, this should be my only semester of basic stuff left
And yes, I know that was a lot of buzzwords, but the point still stands
If life were a linear path to what I wanted, I'd devote all my time to school and be much further along the way to where I wanna be. But it's not, and there's still a lot of time to pass and experiences to be had between now and then, so I'm gonna take some detours and see what else I can find and add to both my journey and goals.
I sold enough of my soul to school via IB. I still love and value learning, but UW clearly wants me to take a bunch of horseshit. I'm taking my brother's advice and am gonna try to make classes and whatnot 40% of my life and spend the other 60% of my life pursuing other things that matter and exploring something new.
When it comes to college
For you?
I feel that
Idk, what are your guy's expectations/goals/thoughts/etc.
I've never seen someone as excited to work as this, but I get where you're coming from
Not just personal things
I want to work on things that matter
As weird as it sounds
Work
Become that's what I really want to do
But overall I can do my hobbies, I can do my studies, and I can just wait until I can go into industry
Idk, you deserve something good out of this, even if it isn't directly related to engineering shenanigans.
All of those things have multiple other things wrapped up in them and they overlap
But still
lmaoooo
Ok I'll stop
Aww
She's a lifestyle
Salina is not a hobby
Jk on the last one
Eh, hobbies are, "Engineering", Gym, Videogames, Socializing, and Salina
I know college is mostly useless classes with a couple useful ones sprinkled in, but still
Is there anything in the area or on campus you'd feel comfortable doing that you can take advantage of? It doesn't have to directly relate to your long-term educational/professional goals. Just anything to give you something to do/a hobby/whatever? Maybe a change of pace could help.
first part, not the second
Very interesting class that I can apply to my current projects
lol rip. glad to hear it though
Even though it's raping me
I am really enjoying Mechanics of Materials though
Idk, I just want to get out into industry and if this is what I have to do, so be it
And a lot of people take it to heart
That's an oof if I've ever heard one
People joke the only thing to do out here is drink
F
Both figuritivly and literally
Basically Skyline on level on steroids
You don't have to be
It's completely valid. I'd be upset too. It's ok.
Also not a huge fan of the WSU vibe
No, no, it's alright
Idk this is just me rambling at this point
Ah, I get you
^
yea he's saying 6 years of life 4 still ahead
Most masters programs are 2 years
But don't you have BC credit?
2 already done
Masters is my current plan
But you have to learn these things if you want to be able to do the work
Also, 6 years?
Do you have facilities that'd allow you to take advantage of that maybe? I know that doesn't address the immediate problem, but still
Having to stop for 6 years of my life to just learn with no doing isn't very fun for me
I learn by doing
Which is how I teach myself things
I like doing as well
But I don't like just learning
I love learning
I basically view them as a necessary evil
There is no way to just acquire knowledge, so you're gonna have to take classes
<@193229269076279298> sorry to interrupt. Feel free to keep going
<@503787499605458954> I feel like I should've figured that out rip
anyways continue
<@!258094439636008971> makeup remover, that's what that meant
Kinda?
So is it that the classes are just bogging you down unnecessarily or is it another part? I know that you more than anyone have a clear path in mind.
This is just a means to an end for me
I know what I want to do and how to do it
I do
Because no offense, a lot of people don't have a really solid direction
For a lot of people having the structure of college let's them then have complete freedom over the rest of their time, because they're still being told what to do. Once they've done the things their told to do they can do whatever they want with the rest of their time
Is there anything in particular that feels limiting if you don't mind me asking?
I know it's situational. It's different from you cuz of how the past two years have played out. But I really do hope things get better for you eventually.
I don't want to structure of college, I want the freedom to do whatever I want
<@258094439636008971> eh, I don't think so
It's more an inherent problem with college than a situational one
No, that's valid
Burning money doesn't feel good
Honestly, after all this work you've put in, you really deserve it, and I'm sorry it's not working out immediately for you, but I promise it'll get better
But still
Not that is matters to me
Also costs a fuck ton
And I just want to get straight to the freedom part
It's a limbo state between control and freedom
Aww, I'm sorry. I guess it's not for everyone.
College just doesn't really vibe with me
What the hell does that mean <@503787499605458954>
Idk, I talked to my mom about this today when she called me about my birthday
brb I need to take my face off
Don't doubt what I said. My word is law, and I say you're fucking amazing.
thanks
as much as I shit on you you're pretty fuckin great. miss you
Lol, idk
No worries, my dude. You're an amazing friend who means the world. Never forget that.
:)
Thanks <@258094439636008971>
But eh
Which is cool and all
Noah, if it helps, we really, really miss you too and wish nothing but the best for you
The only thing I really gain is access to more facilities
Awww, I'm sorry
My dad asked me to ask you to take winter pictures for him
I'm losing all you guys and my family
I guess Eastern Washington can be pretty at times
So what am I gaining by coming to WSU
So I already had all the free time, and with my parents I also had basically all the independence
That's fair enough, but regardless, you're a wonderful person and deserve better
ok true
I've already been doing college course work for the last two years
I just want to get out into the "real world"
I never was looking forward to "the college experience"
<@258094439636008971> I knew this going in
<@503787499605458954> I'm glad you're having a good time, I'm not surprised you ended up talking with so many people
No, it's not bad, it's just not good either
Awww, I'm sorry, Noah
If we're talking out how college is going so far, for me it's very eh
Nice
Oh damn
Hey, don't worry about it. You'll get close to people soon enough, and we'll always be here for you.
however, I found out today that hong kong girl is also a big cuddler so this could bode very well for ya girl
I miss you guys in that I miss having people I am super close to and comfortable with, but we still having a good ass time out here
That's fair enough. I'm really glad to hear that you're settling in.
Eh, well, I mean, I guess someone like you should have a decent time making friends, so it makes sense lol
we've known each other for all of a day so like we're not super close or anything yet but they're all awesome
or they did to me
literally I just walked up to people and started talking to them
idk everyone's super friendly
What's interacting with these people like? How did you get to know them?
also I think a lot of the local kids already had friends coming in so weren't as keen to branch out immediately
That's fair enough. It's gotta be a really cool experience though.
yeah there's a shit ton of international students but also , somewhat predictably, there's a lot of international students in my specialization
and then all of us minus ecuadorian girl started chatting with this trio from dubai, and that ended up being the group I went to the party with
Damn, are there just a bunch of international students at UBC? That's really awesome
both of them are also IR kids
and then I hung out with him and this girl from ecuador for a while
I met and befriended a friend of my best friends from jsa, which was a pretty lit "small world" moment
Woah, that's super cool! Damn, I'm kinda jealous that you gotta meet them. They sound really interesting.
ok not just that, they're just really cool people too, thai girl wants to major in econ so we talked about that for a long-ass time too, hong kong and I had a long discussion about the protests happening rn, and they're both super nice
IB really does enable us to bitch about IB to other IB students in college
Cw was right
Oh dear god no
Oh no
there's these girls from thailand and hong kong that I bonded with over ib hell stories
Spill
Oh? Tea
I made friends with a shit ton of interesting international students
on a lighter note
Stay safe
No worries, Noah
I will
yea thanks
but being on that much shit just cuts massive parts out
we're here if you ever wanna talk
alcohol up to a point you're still you, just some things are turned up and some are turned down
do what you gotta do to feel alright
but yeah that's a fuckin crazy mix of drugs, goddamn
honestly, we were pretty hilariously responsible about being irresponsible
Awww, Noah. I'm really sorry to hear about that, but I hope you're doing a bit better now. I can definitely see why that'd make you feel uncomfortable, and you have every right to feel that way. You have every right to take care of yourself and be careful about where you are if you're uncomfortable, and I'm glad you're taking your own comfort level into account. Please be careful, Noah. But if you ever need anything, just know that we're here for you.
my best description is playing with the equalizer vs cutting out parts of the song
that's why I liked drinking with you guys
aww hope you're doing ok
it just gets a very visceral reaction out of me
and I just can't take being around people that are high like that
but that's how a lot of people treat WSU frat parties
but I just don't want to be around it
it feels so good and I get it
and I hate it
and I know the feeling
ages 5 - 14 I spent a lot of time in and out of the hospital
and I reminds me of me
you can see it in his eyes
nobody is home
met up with a friend who's really big into the frat life (his brother is a junior in his frat), he was high on a bunch or Adderall, alcohol and we were actually meeting up because my other friend smokes a lot of weed 
So now he's high on weed and Adderall and drunk
it's pretty simple
oof!
Aww, I'm sorry to hear, Noah. Do you want to talk about it? If not, I'll respect your space.
so I think I'll be avoiding the WSU frats from now on
I had a rather bad experience yesterday
You know?
Take care of yourself as well, Noah
Fun times
not a fire
but that's just more medical help
along with the fire truck normally as well
But yeah, I trust you can take care of yourself. I'm glad to see you are.
people are dumbasses
lol, it's not funny, but an ambulance goes to Greek row every single night at WSU
That's gotta be a fun way to start the school year for whomstever that was
alcohol poisoning, again
we saw ambulances get called though
being careful, dw. went with a group of p trustworthy people, didn't walk alone, didn't drink there, and a bunch of others knew where I was
although it was actually being used for the opposite of that two days ago
yee
Regardless, I hope you had fun, Cindy. Glad to see that you're looking after yourself. Keep staying safe and all that jazz.
well I got my full face mask with organic chemical filters
could be a party problem if you get into the right drugs
that's a shop problem
along with the lung and eye issues as well, but that's not really a party problem
my dad already has a certain level of hearing loss from spending so much time working with power tools, so I'm just very aware of the dangers and would rather avoid them
(I'll stop going off on my tangent)
Honestly, some movie theaters can be threatening to hearing. I bet your ass that ain't stopping people.
If you want quality earplugs that maintain sound quality, I'm happy to recommend a pair from my experiences with band, but after offering most people in Skyline pep band, I'm aware that 99/100 people really, really don't care, and I respect that
every concert is hearing damage territory
yeah I really dont
plus, usually you can tell within like 30s whether they're ok with it or not, and oftentimes consent is enthusiastically given in response
<@193229269076279298> ok, that's a given, but most people really don't care
I guess I can see how that can be a given with the setting, although it's a bit wack that that's the standard, even if there's not much that can be done about it
I feel like if it's loud enough to not be able to hear someone talking next to you then you're in hearing damage territory
happens a lot bc like a) it's kinda weird to directly ask a stranger if they wanna dance without leaving room for jesus and b) it's really fucking loud so they wouldn't hear you anyways
Accident or not, while it's nice that it wasn't intentional/boundaries were respected, it's still not a fun time to get groped regardless in my book. Although if you're comfortable in the setting, I won't question it because that's not my decision to make as long as you're looking after yourself (which you seem to be doing, so I'm glad).
Like that kinda "hey imma just grope people and see if they like it"
Shit man that's still hella wack
also, am young attractive female in a room full of drunk/high people pushing up on each other, like it's expected
but I'm also paranoid as fuck
ok neither of the things that happened today were bad though, like I'm 95% sure the first incident was accidental, and the second time he backed off as soon as I made it clear I wasn't feelin it
don't fucking touch me
it's just a hardline issue for me
As Scott and Courtney always put it when they offer me to drink, "if you want to drink, don't go to a college party. Everyone's drinking to get drunk, the alcohol is honestly pretty shitty, and who the hell knows what goes into some of that stuff. It's not worth it for the sake around being a bunch of loud drunk assholes who will probably grope everyone in sight."
I've even hit my dad before over it
Usually I strive to not be groped to have a good time
I've hit a lot of people over touching me
yea I kinda agree with Jarrett
yeah?
That's like your acceptable standard?
Jesus fuck man
I expected much worse so it was fine
it's interesting to hear other people's perspective on these types of things
Sorry about the groping thing, cuz that sounds hella wack, but I'm glad to see your friends are cool. That's always good.
I don't see myself being an active partier, but it's fun on occasion
not sure if I would go back
also they were like packed behind us for the majority of the time we spent on the dancefloor and were especially polite about giving us as much personal space as possible and never made a move/tried to cop a feel
shoutout to my new friends, the guys were hella good about keeping us together and walking us home and shit
I only stayed for like 2 hours
he was cute but I was not in the mood
second time was intentional, dude came up and wanted to grind so his hands were on my ass, I just made eye contact and stepped away and he moved on, it was all good
ok first time the guy was drunk out of his mind and I feel like this was an accident but he like grabbed my boob
"I only got groped twice" what is you response to this?
I didn't die or get assaulted, I got mildly tipsy without getting drugged, I only got groped twice and I still managed to have a good time so I would rate tonight a success
as for where the paranoia stops, I would say never, tbh
today I visited the frats for the first time, so it was full-out madness, and to be clear it's not about what type of alcohol it is or whatever it's that I've known an absurd number of girls who have been drugged and I've been explicitly warned not to take open drinks
to answer the first question it depends on the party
question, from a girl's perspective where does the paranoia (using paranoia feels rather insulting but I don't have a better word right now) in life stop?
you don't know what's in other drinks, even if it looks like beer/wine/etc
probably the move
so do you just plan to always show up with your own drinks?
I can do drinking, I can't be near people on most drugs
it's the drugs
my issue at WSU isn't the drinks
Yeah you gotta pregame I really don't trust drinks here
opposed to showing up drunk/high?
It's weird going into this stone cold sober
I'm always happy when things start that way
good start
well you're not dead yet
It's not bad
And I hate it viscerally
I know that feeling quite well
Na I just like people to be home when you look in their eyes
jk
"i'm sorry aboot bumping into you, i'm a wee bit tipsy"
polite college partying huh
I have low expectations to say the least
lol rip
Or at least WSU college parties aren't
Two weeks in, already decided college parties are definitely not my thing
take care of yourself and have fun
yike
have fun
gl don't die
Boutta head to my first college party wish me luck lmao
Awww wait that's so wholesome
and I mean I had a car full of stuff I could bring almost whatever I wanted
nah it's for the cute messages y'all wrote me
Gotta bring that yearbook for yearbook bingo
i think i have the exact same desk chair, just in black
I approve of the nap pillow
woah you brought your skyline yearbook???
glad to see you're settling in nicely
i like it
ooooo nice!
Literally no one asked but you're welcome
Glorified trash can and recycle bin bc idk where to dump this shit yet
Food drawer with several large knives
Fairy lights that got ridiculously tangled within 5 mins that I gave up on and shoved into a drawer
Instant pot and coffeemaker are both currently on the floor bc I don't have a table
Some ratchet details:
Peep: massive stack of photos I was too lazy to actually start hanging
Idk how to make beds
A half-assed pre-"actually getting my shit together" room tour
Live it up and make all that tea
That's the fucking tea, sis
Just bought boiling kettle and 200 tea bags for dorm
That's a valid decision cuz you can't go wrong with food
The other is time
Well one of them
Highlights my dislike of food
intresting decision
maybe I'll order one after I move
couldn't decide so I ended up with neither, bought food instead
I think the first one looks coolest, but they're both pretty awesome, and you can't go wrong
what's cooler water effects or northern-lights type stuff
I really want one of these things but I'm having a hard time deciding between the two

Big think :p
Hm do I try to apply again
yea they never give up
It‚Äôs college season again guys
Universities are trying to recruit me
but I have my monitors to fix that
which makes it feel way nicer
Maybe my expectations are too low
it's much more bright than my dorm
Hmm
Tf that's mega nice
Seems p nice!!
New binder because I am a menace
9 once i get flip flops for the shower
8 pairs including the ones i'm wearing
i have several pairs of shoes
no lol
Wait, did you only bring heels?
I brought one pair of heels
forgot about that
oh, i have a pair of flip flops too lmao
damn
I have like three pairs of heels, converse, running shoes and some flip flops
Someone should do it
With this
Replace the heel on this
i also want a good pair of loafers, and my running shoes are like 6 years old and dying so I should prob replace those
tbh even though I have a lot I feel like I'm missing some essentials i.e. white sneakers, nude pumps, dressy flats
Just replace the heel with them
Would be cheap
No I kinda want to buy stilettos and outfit them with mountain bike shocks and dampeners
lol
Yes
so stilettos you mean
That limits me to basically sneakers/running shoes
My knees require shoes that have cushioning and support
I just care more about money and functionality
I do care about fashion
it'd be such a power move though
I'm not bringing all of them, obviously
honestly it was kinda helpful to list them all out
and also don't care about fashion
you're Male
three pairs
-sneakers for basically all occasions
-dress shoes for when I need them
-boots for snow and hiking
fuck, I need a shoe rack
more if you count my ski/snowboard boots
damn
that's 19 I think?
-2 pairs of converse
-running shoes
-hiking boots
-jelly shoes (mostly for river/stream crossings)
-flip flops
-2 pairs sandals, 1 pair gladiator
-black pumps (business heels)
-fake louboutins (dressy heels)
-block heels
-flats
-wedges
-thigh highs
-knee boots
-2 pairs short heeled boots
-combat boots
I have two pairs of sneakers, dressy shoes, a set of running shoes I don't really wear much at all, and hiking shoes my parents convinced to get thinking I'd go hiking, but boy were they wrong
Idk but they do I guess
ü§∑
Who need a pair of shoes for each day of the month
Admittedly tho 30 is a lot
I have like 2 pairs of flats, 4 pairs of sneakers, 2 pair of boots, 5? pairs of heels/sandals, etc etc
30 is like
Both of them are too
Yea same
You‚Äôre a guy
A lil but but also eh
The normal pair, the dressy pair, and the garden pair
I got like 1 pair
Like
Is it weird that I have only 3 pairs of shoes
Shoes for days
Wow
Their roommate has 30 pairs
Na that's like all of them
Damn must've been hard for them to decide to leave behind that 21st pair
<@258094439636008971> yes
Which I thought was crazy
Although someone I became friends with here brought 20 pairs of shoes
Did Noah bring a whole desktop set up?
You don't need *that* much
I fit all my stuff in a car with 4 people
Why tho?
Gotta clear a lot of clutter
e v e r y t h i n g
I found it relaxing kinda
What do you have left to pack?
Really?
packing is so stressful wtf
Good luck!
maybe i'll go bother jeesoo
i just need xp with physical chem and biochem
Sorry not my thing, but good luck!!
yeah basically
Oh lmao
for shits and giggles
no
Like, for college credit?
i'm in the mcat existential crisis phase
yo anyone wanna take online chem courses w me
It's "diesel is cheaper than gas" territory
We've been here for like 5 minutes, and it's p nice so far
Gene's transferring to WSU
(my family that is)
We're here for the weekend
Wait why?
?
<@193229269076279298> lmao hi we're entering Pullman
I'm strolling into the Pullman area with a UW hoodie this weekend lmao
Anglicization is a real bitch
Gene is Jiayi's cousin confirmed
It's technically supposed to be Jiaqi, but my parents anglicized it further so it was somewhat pronounceable
Very close but not quite
I have a cousin named Jiaqi and also a cousin named Jiayuan
Wait <@233062637922025472> don't you actually have a cousin named Jiachi?
Jiachi sounds like Jiayi's other cousin
I regret giving UW my middle name
oh boi
<:TH:605635628205604885> <:KZ:607334139493875760> <:TH:605635628205604885> <:KZ:607334139493875760> <:TH:605635628205604885> <:KZ:607334139493875760> <:TH:605635628205604885> <:KZ:607334139493875760> <:TH:605635628205604885> <:KZ:607334139493875760>
Oh yeah, you bet üòâ
huh
well you'll probably be screaming either way huh
How do you know it's not without going in?
unless the hot source is tom holland i'm not going towards it
If I'm dying because of a rice cooker fire, you have my explicit permission to point and laugh at me as I die
hot
If you have a fire extinguisher, yeah
bc it's so
yes
do i go TOWARDS the fire?
when a room is on fire
hm
You're free to come in then at any hour
Unless we actually did manage to start a fire with the rice cooker
I mean, like, as long as you don't try knocking at 4AM without telling anyone
....
Did I say that you guys weren't?
are we allowed in your room?
oh boi
...
I'd like to propose the alternative solution: if one of you ever complains about the other, tell them "at least you're not rooming with Gene," walk across the hall, and walk into a flaming mess because we somehow found a way to start a fire with a rice cooker
but i feel like without an organizer i'd just leave stuff everywhere so maybe in order to be a good roommate to you i should get one
mine's not üòÑ
my hair is a finicky bitch
i have to be careful with shampoo
naw
seriously?
Inb4 Salina steals Jane's shampoo and soap
hey i'm not that bad of a roommate
Unless y'all like sharing
but also idk
Keeps your shit seperate from their shit
i vote no
I vote yes
My roommate bought like a shelf thingy
Then no
yee
Do you have a bathroom in your room?
do you guys think i should bring an organizer for my bathroom stuff
it's mostly just toothpaste, toothbrush, hairbrush/dryer, lotion and soap
Has planning gone well at least?
Oof I'm sorry
had 0 motivation to actually start college planning till like 2 days ago when I finally went into panic mode
I probably just need to find some motivation to be productive to not be lmao
I'm lowkey getting kinda sick of summer but am nowhere near ready for college to start
wait holy shit nvm that's crazy they're so cheap there
maybe I'll take a look around target tomorrow
hm
And a makeup mirror on the desk
I'm going to get a $15 hanging mirror from target
yeah that's kinda what i was thinking lol
Don‚Äôt you have a bathroom with a mirror
I say no
do y'all think it's worth it to get a door mirror
ok I underestimated how expensive mirrors are
Okie :)
a note to anyone else who might end up buying dorm stuff, bedding etc on amazon: the "off to college" shop is actually SO HELPFUL I can't believe how much time I wasted not using that
Big companies recruit earlt
And Google Facebook etc
Yeah
what, for microsoft?
This is such fast turnaround
Also internship application processes have already started
I don't actually see it that way but it's an interesting observation
Average tuition is 30k ish so that is the real price of a person's tuition
I wouldn't view it that way
`I'm paying my roommate's full tuition` still does not make sense to me
So I'm paying two people's worth of tuition
About 60% of students get some financial aid so average tuition is like 30k
She's a quest ridge student and I pay full price
excuse me?
I'm paying my roommate's full tuition
it's hype
yee
Oh so you have separate rooms
have a bathroom between us
we're sharing a suite
What happened to rooming with melena?
You're in a single?
so be as extra as you want
you are in a single
but
very
on a scale of 10 to too much how extra is that LMAO
I order gold satin sheets off of amazon
what if
I got 400 thread count sheets for $20 from target
why is shopping for bedsheets of all things so difficult
This is weird
That means it's in less than two weeks
My class schedule has started showing up on my calendar highlights
i took photos of the filled out form and record and put them both in a word document that i uploaded
How did y'all send in your immunization records?
<@&574247915518689281>
No problem, my dude. Take care and video call us every now and then.
Thanks Gene :)
Hope you're doing well in WSU so far
We miss you, Noah :(
computer is officially up and running
idk when he's getting here
he's not here yet
Lol
Is he aware?
<@173668455856340994> I am aware
O man your roomate is gonna love the light of three monitors blaring at him
The furniture looks pretty nice!
Hey, nice! Good luck, Noah!!
The move in process has begun
but my roommate seems to think there's a kitchen on every floor, so ima just expect that at this point
i heard something that not all west campus dorms do, which had me confused
I thought they had a kitchen on every floor?
my roommate seems to think so
Idk lol
<@!520095106888630348> <@!340319804747415553> wait, fuck, do we have a kitchen on our floor? cuz i'm starting to think we don't
i'm glad to see you read them
Thanks, they mention it in the instructions as well
If it's a humidifier, be sure to clean it out every now and then. Otherwise, it'll get moldy and spit that shit out into your room.
Just add water
Works quite well
Testing a mini cooling unit for my dorm
So you say you're not that good
Yeah then they'll be disappointed
like, on the spot
if you ever claim to be good at singing, people will ask to hear you sing
I'm actually not that good
Jkjk
I'm not that good
and that's a fact
"i'm not that good" is something good singers say to be humble
HAH
shit, he just told me "i'm not that good"
Flip a desk discretely so no one can trace it back to you and fine you for it
he plays guitar and sings, so that's automatically at least decent
Problem solved
I will have a mini desk on my desk
Shhh
I  B L E S S  T H E  R A I N S  D O W N  I N  A F R I C A
If you flip your own desk that's your loss
I will flip a table
very clearly one extreme
I swear to god if I hear someone drunkenly belting out Africa by Toto when it‚Äôs late
uhm
i am
I'm somewhere between the two extremes
There‚Äôs a difference between singing and singing well
Gene who are your roommates?
Ok here‚Äôs the thing
also <@!520095106888630348> apparently one of my roommates sings, so there's proof that band kids can indeed sing sometimes
yeet
I‚Äôm down
Sure haha
we should get our roommates together and play some tabletop games sometime
Idk if our roommate is staying with us that‚Äôs the thing
*friendly* reminder
This dorming situation is sounding very cursed
Just a very
I know
you're just telling me your roommate doesn't do martial arts
that's not new information
that's not
uhm
And we‚Äôre 2/3 of a martial arts trio
The bad news is that we‚Äôre across the hall from ya
The good news is that we‚Äôre across the hall from ya
I have some good news and bad news for you
You know gene
Lol
good luck with that lmao
Kill the roommate
<@!340319804747415553> <@!520095106888630348> 
i have some good news and some bad news
the good news is that me and my roommates are 3/4 of a sax quartet
the bad news is that me and my roommates are 3/4 of a sax quartet
lol
Decision trees
that's wholesome
awww
My mom just sent me this link üòÇ 
https://www.etsy.com/listing/632548322/have-you-called-your-mom-pillowcase?from=singlemessage
<@193229269076279298>
CSE via Computer Engineering, direct admit to CoE already
<@478706068223164416> Gabe is wondering about your comp sci college plans
Oh no üò•üòüüòü
War is hell
Oh there's another
lol
wearing beach shirts in egypt seems lowkey cursed
Y E S
Family vacation
lol
My phone camera's p shit
That's the original I believe
<@258094439636008971> is that the original file size or do you have a higher quality version?
Now that I have a full Adobe suite at my disposal
Oooooh I can do that
lol
We need to photoshop them in front of various touristy landmarks
..yikes
Alan is secretly wondering if he'll get fired once they come home from vacation
it even looks like he was forced to be there against his will while his parents yell at him to smile at the camera
lol
iconic
oh my gosh
Just don't become this
So we gucci
There are exceptions, but Salina isn't a middle-aged dad on vacation
and ay floral shirts are always nice
Salina rolling up into the UDistrict with a trenchcoat on
Trench coat, nice
Oooo nice!
*trench coat*
and like a basic floral shirt top that i thought was cute
T r e n c h  c o a t
a neat trench coat
That sounds awesome
Tea
i got some sandals that i'll just prob wear around
tell us
yea what'd you get?
aw yiss
What did you buy?
Oooo nice!
i'm excited for the stuff to come
i went on a smol shopping spree today
rip
Also, I'd kinda need a charger anyways I guess, so I guess the dock purchase checks out
I mean, it's pretty much the same price as a controller
speaking of shopping
rip dock
All of this shit is cheaper than the tuition at NYU. I'm technically still saving money.
But again, as I've said while shopping for anything for college
Although I kinda plugged my dock through the wall, so I might have to buy a second one.
Overcooked time baybee
i will check
i think so
i might settle for the smaller one at home but it's def large enough to play games
Does it have an HDMI in?
if it fits
:D
Oh dam
but i'm bringing a 27 in monitor
idk
Will they let me plug an HDMI cord into the TV in the lounge area?
fuck yeah i'm down
YAS
We found our fourth Overcooked player
I can just mosey on over to yall now
But yeah
<@340319804747415553> sadly everything is filled in elm
West Campus Gang
I'm in Terry now
Aight y'all
Have you seen how little I work out? I don't think I have an established routine lmao
i'm naturally like a 4:00-7:00 exercise person
screw you noah
okay fine
And I force Salina to either go with me then or go on her own at another time
I am a night gym person
Correction
No
Lol
i am open to morning workouts though
burn off the sad boi energy
night
Are you guys morning workout people or afternoon?
Sure
That or we can play Overcooked together
Hell yeah.
Is that floor bonding?
5th floor Elm workout gang?
Yeah I should work out
#motivation
time to get in shape so i can get to class on time
:D
Yeet sure why not
come work out with me!
woo
Time to get in shape
We're literally gonna be living above a gym
but looks like i'll be getting a good workout in twice a week :p
yeah
At least they're first-floor classes
run
....you may have to run/get a bike
12 minutes
how long does google maps say it'll take to walk?
It's a lecture. I doubt they'll care/notice.
i don't think they take roll so they probably won't care too much
also if it's that bad i'll just let the teacher know that there's a legit reason
it might not be fun though
i can make the walk
geT A SKATEBOARD
nah it's fine
just aware of the inevitable doom
you can get a lime bike
You alright?
i love the feeling of inevitable doom
ah
I'd check a campus map
I think that's south to north
idk what direction that is
marine to kane
Because I know north to south is downhill
Are you going north to south or south to north?
1/2 mile walk/run in 10 mins
i'm not looking forward to mondays and wednesdays
...
Study budy
Ayy nice
what the actual fuck
guess i'll just walk the 1/2 a mile because i just wanna get this credit out of the way
is engl in the marine sci building
wait....
lowkey it hasn't updated in my plan but it's correct in the registration page
I call this: what is waking up early
see you in class jane
switched chem quiz sections
ok
Hold on
I saw you
<@520095106888630348> where we meeting?
ok yea
me too
well i'm gonna need to take bio/chem/ochem/physics classes in the future
you're taking bio?
?
well bio and chem are gonna be fun
Sounds great
like 1:30?
When did you wanna do this <@520095106888630348>?
Sorry for the slow response
I'm down
*we could play pokemon go*
we could go to the library and go down that trail by it
oh yknow what
I'm weak
Definitely a short one
a short one?
lol what kind of hike you thinking about
no none at all
I do not lmao
<@!478706068223164416> do you?
do you know places to go hiking?
Big brain
I thought it was 2
Actually, I misread the time cuz I'm a dumbass. Hiking might be an option lol
yeah i guess
Might be a little late to organize a hiking trip
If we wanna do outside outside, we could just chill at Pine Lake Park or something
outside outside
Like outside the house or like outside outside?
I don't know
I wanted to go outside
I would be down. What did you have in mind?
do you want to do something
Why
Not particularly
are any of you guys busy today?
I only saw bad reviews for stats teachers, others seem okay
Design profs seem to be out for your head
I've heard math and physics can be p oof too
there's a handful of bad physics and cs instructors, but there's also bias because those classes are hell
a lot of the bad ones seem to be in the sociology, stats, chem, and bio departments
read up on the professor reviews at uw
they expect students to basically have no work ethic
I don't blame them
the advisors have no faith in people
he's like
i talked to the revered saint nicholas
i mean it'd be like five years
Get a few cans of air freshener and disinfectant
i'd cry
What if you're in his old room
he used to live in elm
He does not often seem keen on helping you out
Your brother sounds like the exception
he doesnt GIVE IT
ok well i ASK my brother for help
^^
I found the best advisors to be alumni or upperclassmen
I'm sure it's a mixed bag and people only complain about the bad ones though
Actually tho, I've heard some bad stories about some UW advisors
i need to stupid proof some software
byeee
okay i'm leaving now bye guys
chances are i'll prob switch
ok no
Lesson #1: Always doubt your UW Advisor
i just took my advisor's word for it because I figured he knew better than i do
no i'm not
Are you sure there aren't non-FIG openings?
okay
damn wtf
nope
alan are you in an english fig?
plus a few engineering things
english 131, cse 143x, math 124
<@&574247915518689281> pin your schedules like I asked y'all to
alan what are you taking?
bye salina
lmao ok
The more I look at my schedule, the more I kinda resent it
i kinda need to do work
that page
i'll do it later
you know the ugly page where you enter SLN codes to manually register for classes
https://helpcenter.uw.edu/myplan/drop-courses/
wait how do i unregister for a class?
get the fuck outta here STARBOT
thanks starbot
no fuck you
Fuck you too, Alan
my friday is no long as delightfully empty
first class 11:30 gang
Fig Newtons
the main thing about the v quiz section tho is
but i did want to join a fig so i'm not that angry
i'm slightly bitter now
Idk if that's still the case though
Yeah, there were a lot of non-FIG English classes open for me too
...but i'm in eng 131
i sniped a nonfig section at a p good time
not all of them
because figs can go and fig themselves
don't you need a fig for that?
non fig mind you
eng 131
chem, nursing, and what?
wait Salina what else are you taking?
Tfw your lecture is 9:30
join mehhhh
considering joining the v quiz section bc i don't feel like waking up for a 9:30 quiz section on wed
i'm like
Cuz I'm hearing shit online about how most classes are curved around a 2.7 or something
And like, should I adjust my expectations from high school?
How much do our college GPAs matter?
Ok, so I should get this out of the way now
It's basically just Skyline finals all over again
the final is at 2:30 pm on thurs
AM or PM?
my quiz section is like 10:30 am on thurs
V?
doesn't make sense
that straight up
And you take the final during your quiz section if I recall correctly
Lectures are MWF
Yes... But you sent your quiz section
does the quiz section impact when the final is
we're in the same class section though
also what quiz section are you in
She has a different quiz section than you
rip
well
basically 4 hours of straight testing
we're off for a fun finals week
well jane
laughs in *well fuck*
It was pretty dilluted though, so I just rinsed it off
Yeah
you what?
Flashback to that one time I spilled a carcinogen across my arm
I'm a terrible lab partner
Since it's chem
Although I guess it might be a good thing though
lol r i p
Although I am actually kinda sad about it though
I know
insert obligatory /s
dw
also
:(
But this was the only design 150 class
I really did
Look, I tried my best
u make me sad
Cuz that's when the audition bands meet too lol
Although I am kiiiinda considering dropping Design
:(
Excuse me, I have a straight up conflict
flake
:(
Just imagine I'm there too
welcome to the party!
jeesoo and i are chem D
It'll tell you what you're eligible to sign up for
Check your email for your score
Lmao
i did take the math exam
wait
I think a 6 on SL checks out
If you didn't, you should take the placement test. Otherwise, you'll be stuck in Math 120, which I hear is hell and unnecessary.
isn't that the HL exam?
Well, did you get a 6 or above on the IB exam?
i probably have to huh
and no not this quarter
yea
Wait, did you to the placement test?
Do you want to take math?
i'm not totally sure what math i can take
Lmao
probably not, you don't really get to talk
Alan's gonna spend all of Math 124 avoiding me
If you really want to, we can study together or something still. I don't think actually being in the same classes as friends is all that important.
I'd love to though
it's ok lmao
I'm sorry
üò†
I can't without dropping design :/
there's like 1 other person in my quiz section i think
you should join
thank
Congrats on getting out of 8:30 chem!
Yeah, she was trying to get me to join a while back
cool
oh is she?
I think Salina's in that class too
nice
alright well we'll see
oh really?
K, good. The prof's supposed to be awesome.
yeah
Not Chem C?
That's Chem D, right?
Woah, that's so cool
they have a thing were you can click through multiple options
Galaxy brain
jk build a schedule did it for me
DAMN i'm so smart
Hey, nice!
Hm?
oh wait
Cuz that might fit
Did you check Chem D yet?
Is there nothing in Chem B with a Wednesday afternoon lab?
Yike, that nursing class is hard to schedule around
i didn't drop that class yet
yeah
Is this still Chem A?
just wanna get into the class
and I don't want to join a chem FIG
ignore the green
Sorry. Registration's starting to hit that point where it's becoming a bitch to find a spot. :/
rip
Otherwise, I would sign back up for whatever looks like the best chem slot for now and wait
Also <@520095106888630348> if you wanna wait for the FIG to open up, you could try to set a reminder for MyPlan to notify you when there's availability
Is it a 200 English class?
What are you in right now?
at least none of the ones i can take rn
tbh none of the english classes look very interesting
i did check English
I'd check the English classes while you're on MyPlan. When I was registering, there were a lot of non-FIG English classes open
the FIG has to be full, then you can request a seat
it won't let you
What happens if you try to sign up for it without joining the FIG?
yea their section is p empty i think
They might tbh
rip
Can you send a screenshot of the quiz sections?
it's ok
hopefully the FIG people let me into their quiz section
yea :/
Oh
Do you have any availability to move that to another time in the day?
but there's only one lecture for nursing
mostly nursing
Nursing
and in the winter it gets dark at like 4
so i'd need to call a police officer to get to and from class
What parts of your schedule do they conflict with?
like 8:30 AM or end at 9:30 PM
they conflict with my schedule or are like ridiculous times
So what non-FIG chem options are there?
Ohhh ok
that's what my advisor said, probably gotta be in a fig for english
yeah i think so
Do you need a FIG to take English?
and i do want to take English
there's a page i went to that's for requesting a seat in a class that's fig only
and that fig showed up
i think it's full
You could change your FIG
i don't know what i did but i think i requested a seat because the FIG is full
and I already am in a FIG
i'm trying to get into the B section for chem but all the quiz sections don't work or are reserved for FIGs
ok
So yeah. https://helpcenter.uw.edu/myplan/drop-courses/ Use that all you need <@520095106888630348>
Hell, changing in the first week seems to still count as just a registration change
Yeah just checked. Ws don't happen until like you're a couple weeks into the quarter. If it's before the quarter, it's just a registration change.
usually you don't get a W until several weeks into the quarter
I'm researching it right now
I would look into whether this would give you a W on your transcript though. I don't think it should, but it's worth checking
https://helpcenter.uw.edu/myplan/drop-courses/
You can't do it from MyPlan. I think you have to go to MyUW
Wait, nvm
I think if you select the class from the build your schedule thing, there should be an option
how do you unregister from a class??
sure, it's the "farthest", but all of west campus is still pretty close together
the box is west campus
circled is terry hall
trees being worth money is hilarious
i find that sentence hilarious
The Elm tree outside is apparently worth like a butt ton of money
elm(o)
we can have sad parties
if you can, come to elmmmm
West campus gang
come to west campus
Otherwise, you could go either way
If you really wanna be on West campus, go for it
It's also just a smaller building in general, so there's less people to fuck up the lounges, but it's also less social
whoa
Terry has a rooftop patio apparently
Not my favoritest thing, but it's whatever
Which
A lot of STEM folks down in West campus
Yeah that too
also kind of because engineers tend to cluster in west rather than north
North campus tends to be a bit more social per my understanding, although a lot of that is because of shared bathrooms
Tbh, I couldn't tell you which room it is
lol is your roommate problematic?
And as long as i dont have that guy's exact room im cool with it
Terry Hall is one of the newest
Eh i can walk
Jarrett probably wouldn't be in the LLC if he'd trading rooms
Terry is where the honors LLC is
oof i heard about that
Somebody died in Terry Hall earlier this year
It's a bit of a walk from campus
You haven't heard anything bad about it or anything
And the rooms have the same specs
Cause i someone wants to switch with me
You haven't heard anything bad about it or anything
Other than that, pretty standard west campus dorm
Furthest west campus dorm from the classes and whatnot
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=f4gNCpDxMaM
What do you wanna know about it?
What's Terry Hall like?
Knowledgeable people
Hey
that's awesome lol
Bool
gene's across the hall from me and jane
yeah
Yep
speaking of which, did all of you get the new dorms?
no. haggett is hexagonal but everyone can go in, you just might not get out
me: so it's haggett
noah explaining sc2: it's hexagonal and no one can go in
kill
My other roommate's from IHS lol
If you're in a doubles you can also have both people loft their beds up to make extra room for a little lounge/TV area
There's a little shelf attached to the desk that you can detach and put on the end of your bed instead, and I've seen people put TV's on those
She'll probably put it in the space where she won't be putting a desktop computer
A September 31st problem
That sounds like a September problem
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Where are you gonna put a TV?
Oh god lmao
we‚Äôre never leaving the room
she likes marvel
anyway i‚Äôm never leaving the room
my roommate is bringing her TV
You gotta pull the Roommate Policy on that one. If you walk into something questionable happening inside the room, but no one is in immediate danger and you don't need to sleep right away, walk away and accept that this is a problem for later.
if he's into that, you're going to judge if he does it while you're there to see it
I mean, if he's into that, I'm not gonna judge, but it's a little weird to take a dog photo if that's what's happening
someone is sitting like on his forehead
who took the photo??
he's holding the dog with two hands
aww
show us the dog !
WHICH IS A SHAME, CUZ HE JUST SENT A PHOTO, AND HE'S ADORABLE
nice, too bad no pets in dorms
HE HAS A PUPPY
GUYS, I STRUCK ROOMMATE GOLD
30 seconds of stalking later, I now know he's a CS boi
Ah yes, now it's coming to bite me. I'm being asked if I have an Instagram or a Snapchat.
Where's Mill Creek?
We have like a week-long thing where we just so nothing, but it's optional
Yeah
no more orientation events?
if you guys have orientation now does that mean in september you move in and go straight to classes?
I've seen the pain first-hand
Yeah, which is why I pity them even more
didn't you have to go?
I pity anyone who has to go to orientation
how so
He was at orientation today, so I already pity his soul
Confirmed: they know each other
what did he say?
Haha nice
One of my roommates responded
hahaha do it
If I t-pose on the first day while laying down ground rules, I don't think I'll ever have to deal with that problem
Just hope your roommate doesn't have a girlfriend who stays the night
Speaking of which, the noise cancelling feature on my headphones keeps cutting out when the bus vibrates and it's so weird
Tape styrofoam around your door
Get those noise cancelling headphones ready
i'm right next to the stairs and the kitchen
shiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
nice schedule. it's p compact.
i wish i could. didn't have a choice tho lol
fuck waking up early
i like that i get to be done with shit at 12:30 on friday and have the weekend open.
my schedule as of now
Jeesoo and I are premed sci buddies
Like 90% sure most of us don‚Äôt have classes together
Sure
<@&574247915518689281> do wanna all wanna pin pictures of our schedules here so we can compare classes?
We‚Äôll have to see how this goes
oooo have fun
But they were like come even if you have no experience
No I don‚Äôt row
like daniel got a private double at 3 in lander with it off, and adam just got back from work a few minutes ago and slid into a triple in lander and noted that there were a few more similar options like that as of right now too
so apparently there's better rooms if you turn off the substance-free filter
watch them never respond.
i just texted my roommates. let's see what happens lmao
it can be relaxing and you also feel cool while doing it
i really like sailing
yeah
it's cool and really rewarding, but it's one of the most demanding sports out there
it's more of a full-body workout
oooof
all the rowers i knew in high school were in constant pain and slept at 4 AM every night
it's not as much about your arms as you think
according to a rowing friend 80% of the work is actually in your legs
rowing makes you swole but hurts like hell
i almost became a rower during high school
my roommate does sailing and rowing so i think i'm going to try it with her
ooooh interesting
do you row?
bc it sounds like social suicide combined with premed/nursing
if i make the elite team (which i won't without divine intervention) kick me and tell me not to join
i'm yolo trying out for rowing
also y'all
yeah i'm not worried about you getting along with people
still gonna have to go out of my way to meet people tho
ill get along with them for sure. im p good of at least doing that
just try your best to be friendly with them and i think things will work out great
im kidding
that's entirely possible but i don't think it's a deal breaker
ill walk in and whatever conversation they have just stops
plus they're also freshmen so i doubt they have "their own thing" yet
just when they're talking about stuff in the dorm, it would be nice to not feel left out
you don't have to do things with them
i'd rather not be the guy who's tagging along with two other people who are already doing their own thing
work in the library more lol
put on a pair of headphones
if they start fighting certainly distance yourself though lol
i think that's pretty unlikely and even so, it would be worth it to have friends in your room the rest of the time
and then be the messenger that gets shot
wait for them to fight
or just
try to be outgoing at the beginning and make friends with them asap, and involve yourself into conversations whenever suitable
even if you have little in common
the good thing about being with two people who are friends though is if you make friends with one of them the other is more likely to be friendly with you too
but im clearly in a different situation
tbf, i was praying for a half-full double
a few half full doubles
so maybe don't eliminate the idea of living in a dorm again yet
group 2 was triples too
you'll definitely have a better chance next year then
which is why the morning people were still hit with some oofs
i think they have all returning students pick before freshmen
are you guaranteed into an earlier group next year or is it always random?
aww rip
and the 3:00 gang (including yours truly) was just picking their poison of triples
so the first wave actually had doubles to hunt down
except they split us up into groups
So I got everything I wanted lol
that was this
I clicked in less than a second
yeah
Literally
Things disappear in a minute
That's what registration was like for me
but this was like "rooms are literally disappearing on west campus if you decide to search and see what's available on north campus"
course requests were pretty relaxed for us
not at all
and also RNGesus's decision
Kinda like course requests?
this was a reaction time test
oh, this wasn't a confusion thing
Next year you'll be less confused tho
Haha
even if it means having like 6 roommates in one apartment building lol
Sounds like a good idea
i guess ima look into an apartment for next year. this entire process was hell
lol
Jkjk lol
I'm on east
west so far appears to be: gene, alan, jane, salina, and kenneth
norther appears to be: jarrett and emi
gotcha
ah
we have a poll going
whos north and whos west?
so
i feel like they know each other tho
Oh wait you said no
Do you know who your roommates are?
That sounds pretty decent
triple in elm
Are you actually out of options or do you have a decent room already
...what are you doing
with the fastest hand in the west
im working over here
little do they know though
UW decided to shaft the 3:00 gang and shove us into haggett
She knows
tell her she snagged a good one
That's the ideal
private bathrooms and access to a creative room downstairs
west campus double with a private bath
ken and I super clutched in retrospect
Triples in McCarty are literally the only thing left
it's close to classes and was recently rebuilt like three years ago
oh, mccarty is good
She snagged a triple in McCarty tho
what about north?
oh noo
mcmahon might honestly be better than haggett despite the 24/7 quiet policy
aw, that sucks
The girl next to me is distressed
All full for girls too
go to haggett kind of empty
like, zero beds left
all west campus dorms are full on the guys side
ima facebook stalk my roommates instead of reaching out to them like a normal human being
I can vouch for that
haggett smells like a submarine
McMahon looks like a dystopian bunker from ready player one and you cannot change my mind
there are so many fucking numbers lol
my roommate's email addresses bother me so much
haggett looks like a submarine
elm hall is right next to poplar
it's hilarious
oh ew
haggett's rooms are hexagons
<@!460689096646590465> sure thing! but please be sure to drop by and visit sometime so we don't miss you too much
w h a t is the hexagon
none of us got stuck in the hexagon gang
i gotta go out and make new friends now
hey guys, let's look on the bright side
oh rip
west campus
West
where is elm
Lmao I'm sure it'll be fine
they're in for quite a year
i feel bad for jonathan and sean
She lucked out
We're delightful tho
i feel like these two guys know each other tho lol, so i feel for your mystery third
our mystery third is 253 number
nice
hahahaha
they both have 425 numbers
wait guys
no
from skyline?
sean broderick and jonathan?
its not a third wheel if its a tricycle
i wonder who sean and jonathan are, but i mostly just hope i'm not third wheeling on a duo who already knows one another
yeah, dining account plans are weird
bc it ain't letting me change my dining acct plan
it's still loading
i dont know
when you've picked a room does that count as assigned to it or no
wait
this is big hurt
actually, lemme look at a floor plan
18, 29, and 45 were also open
we're 532
i just grabbed elm 513
this is a temp room tho. ima see if i can snag something else
ayy ok lol
i think we're 5th floor
that way we can easily meet up and cry
should i take 4th or 5th floor?
that's where me and jane are
come to elm
should i go Elm, Maple, or Poplar?
wait, i got choosy and now cant find shit
triple life it is
well <@!520095106888630348>
okay wow
idk
why cant i search lander?
lot to pick from for me
wtf
it's still telling me no female doubles on west with private bathroom
wait
rip i have to click another link
i'm stuck trying to reload the search
fuck
IM IN
which makes me kinda concerned that im studying UX from them
northeastern ui on the other hand
they just dont fucking care
uw ui is atrocious
that's not gonna stop them tho
oh there are thousands of better systems
agreed
there‚Äôs gotta be a better system than this
chuuuuugg
*that can't be right*
it's telling me there's no doubles with private bath on west
wait
*let's go lag*
15 seconds
Let's get some bread
all loaded up let's go
good luck y‚Äôall
Let's get us some of that bread
3:00 gang all loaded up
I think it's the last one
next batch of rooms releases at 3
what‚Äôs going on with housing rn
Yes lmao
that's also me talking about room selections in general with you guys lol
Me talking to my friends about rooms and how they can get doubles and whatnot even though my time slot isn't up yet:
They pre-separate rooms by gender I'm p sure, so I don't think they affect what I have to choose from
I'm kidding lol
"I am on your side, but only conditionally"
Poach all you want as long as you don't push me into a hexagon lol
oh ok
Refresh your page
Yes that was Shirley Hu but she changed dorms to be with Selena Ando
time to poach
there's more at 3?
wait woah
yeah
You can change selections?
I messaged shirley
Poach off of my group
They're releasing more at 3
i'll keep an eye out for doubles but i highly doubt that they will open up
Lmao
jk jk jk
Assert dominance
mmh that sexy lesbian hookup
Make the third person feel like a third wheel üòÇ
No sorry
bc i wanna see if it matches this shirley in the room with us
I'd keep an eye out for if any doubles open up
does anyone have shirley hu's cell number
question
jane and i are in a triple in elm
I don't like that there's no space under the bed
well
They implemented those themselves
lol
I like the shelves on the wall
Being real, all the rooms are about that size
H E X A G O N  G A N G
in fact I bet the photographer is standing in the hallway
behind the camera is the door
this picture shows the entirety of the room
It's old and moldy
Haggett is an L
What's bad about it other than shared bathroom?
Oh no duh
he hated it
You each get two walls, so it's like a double /s
one of my cousins stayed in haggett his first year
Haggett triples look super interesting
well then that's not *wanting* it perse
It's a price thing
No one wants to share rooms with each other in haggett
he's gonna regret it
One of my friends does
aint nobody wanna go to hagget
Now you have two beds
You did well
Nice job asserting your dominance
ill just leave it up to fate
IT'S FREE REAL ESTATE
well
john man bailed
oh big sad
Rip lmao

Hm

well the other guy was Jonathan Benjamin
My uw email is gwang329@uw.edu

i thought you couldnt change it
o neat
Alright, if you're happy, then that's good
if not i shall quickly get used to it
You could try changing if you wanted
mostly
ah yeah
<@173668455856340994> are you comfortable with that?
Yiiike
eh
only triples left there too
ah it says community bath
Speaking of which <@460689096646590465> nice job!!
McCarty is supposedly p good
<@340319804747415553> you could try the newer north campus buildings?
Yeah, I think you're fine
It depends on which room
it said semi private
Some have private baths
Wait nvm
eh
ah
dont drop something big on me
Madrona has community baths
All the doubles seem to filled on west
Jarrett
Wait
i‚Äôm in mccarty

AW YEAH

This is an L
Wow, you guys must be so Pop(u)lar
Ken and I are in Poplar
https://myhfs.housing.uw.edu/myhfs/SelectRoom.asp?Function=1206
5 stars
I recommend Gene
Video call and screen share with me if you want help. I got Jarrett through his decently.
Make your search set up as broad as possible
i dont see anything for us to choose a room on my hfs
this is un L
Good luck guys! Lemme know how it goes. You guys got this!
ken and I are still scouring
i think we broke uw
Lag is expected
alan are u in this session?
It's thousands of students trying to get on at once
thanks uw

lol its not loading
Y'all gonna be fine. Dw about it. I believe in you all
<@340319804747415553> <@520095106888630348>
``Area 01, located in Maple Hall, is open to everyone with priority access to residential students and their guests, residential conference guests, and UW students enrolled in courses taking place in Area 01.``
https://www.washington.edu/area01/
So you're interested in Area 01 in Maple, right?
would someone mind dropping a link
But HFS website has it somewhere on the page where they describe the amenities
Or check Reddit lol
Somewhere on there, it says it's available to all students with housing
Uh, search up info about amenities
where do i need to be :/
And also I talked to students while touring
Website
is this based on chats or is there somewhere i need to be on the hfs website
It's... Online?
McCarty has 3D printers too
wait where are you guys seeing this info
You can still use it yes
I think it's the LLC in Maple that's full
you're gonna live p close
idk
you can still use it right?
3-d printer o:
it looks like maple is full i think
I mean, all the west campus dorms are basically the same. Idk why everyone's so set on Maple.
maple pls
Y'all gonna live in up in Alder or Lander or McCarty or something
I believe in you guys
jane, we got dis
lol
Only 25% of the rooms at UW are bad
But you're picking ahead of 33% of students
So it's impossible for you to be forced into one of the bad buildings unless you just decide not to pick a room.
Like I told Jarrett
D E E P  B R E A T H S
Is there anything in particular worrying you?
okay...
<@520095106888630348> I promise room selection's gonna go fine for you
Even if you did, you'll still be fine
Basically if you request an LLC, they only show you the LLC rooms. The problem with that is that there's only like 20 of them, and once they fill up, they make you wait an hour until you can pick outside of the LLC floor. If you didn't request an LLC room, you're fine.
Jarrett's probably still gonna get what he wants too
Everyone else in the UW group chat has been getting what they want
It means only one specific floor in Elm filled up
No, that's good news for you
So he can't pick from the other buildings until 12:30
guess i'll die
well
damn
But that filled up
Jarrett selected an LLC
housing is that bad???
wait
Do you wanna video call me and screen share?
yessir
Did you refresh?
cant
Try setting substance-free to no
thats not changeable now
maybe its because my housing preferences are substance free and all but
Yo, try refreshing what
yeah also nothing
See if any of the new North campus buildings are open
literally all im searching for
Try having no specifications now
Wait what
nothing
the only specification im going on now is north/west
I'd remove that one
Any other specifications?
in the search its completely empty
well
yeah
Did you select substance-free rooms?
yes
Across the entire campus?
Shit
now
none
ah
<@173668455856340994> what are they?
Lander is what I'm hoping to land
what
literally only 2 options show up for me
k
oof
Good luck
The entire process is just a free for all
i've heard people say lander is a good place
Ken and I are gonna try for Alder next
Maple is full
update on housing attempt
lol rip
you put in some preferences and hope for the best
for me room assignment was basically russian roulette
except you can't see what any of the others are doing
lol sounds like it
Also, is room selection basically a modified battle royale?
Which, it's not worth it
Only if you live in Haggett
üòÆ
wait you guys get walk in closets?
including living in a building that looks like a dystopian bunker from ready player one
Walk-in closet
the hexagons sound kinda fun, except for all the other things that come associated with it
jarrett you need a profile picture
love me some alcohol poisoning
So we either get a nice room or have fun in a hexagon
that's fair
or, join a frat and deal with even more shit, just a different variety of shit
Seattle apartments are hard to come by
you can yeet out and live in an apartment if it's really not going well eventually
I expect no less from UW. Prepare for four years of this chaos.
would you rather have a process where you state your roommate preferences but they assign you to a random room in a random building?
Oh, it's a mess
instead of having thousands of people attempt to do it at the same time
youd think this process would be better
room selection?
Today's the big day <@&574247915518689281>
rip?
<@193229269076279298> it's an cheesy example they used at orientation, doubling as an insult to our intelligences
Lmao Alan
have you met your roommate already?
?
I posted a snarky snapchat on it
he comes home all the time at 12-1 AM and doesn't pay attention to all the lights and noise they make
my roommate's a fuckin bitch
If you wake up later than your roommate leaves that won't be as much of a problem
When do you go to sleep
You really need to fix your sleep schedule dude
I use like 7 alarms to wake up
Oh crap that brings me to problem #2
Worst case scenario, it'll be a healthy motivating factor. You shouldn't be staying up this late every night.
And I'm sure your roommate would pay the same respect towards you if they needed to leave for an early class as long as you communicate that
Just slip in quietly once you get back and sleep
Honestly, if you need to study late at night, I doubt you'd be in your room
14 years of pain
That'll be like sharing a room with my brother again
No
And Jane
Yeah but we're past the bar of "late sleepers"
<@173668455856340994> I think you severely overestimate how many people our age are truly "early sleepers."
I hope to get better sleeping habits since my roommate is an early sleeper but maybe both of us will sleep late instead lol
Jane and I are just gonna be old cat ladies chilling in our room lol
I think what he means is working in the dark silent room late at night with a sleeping person next to you for several hours will make you crazy
Or just be quiet?
I swear to god if my roomate is an early sleeper imma go crazy
Well
There really was no roommate finder assignment thing huh
Basically yeah
Am I just gonna choose a room that some other sap also chooses?
Hey so for the housing
No, and they shouldn't lol
no
do your parents know you act like this online?
<@470822754262712329> still haven't seen the board üòï
talk like a proper human being right now or I will smack you with this here board
Owo
:3
someone get the hose
Uwu
did someone say lofi?
don't mention lofi around him
it gets so bad sometimes that he impulsively responds to certain phrases
as such any vocabulary he may use comes from strictly the internet
he only exists on the internet
it's worse in his case
That sounds like a problem of our generation üòÖ
he also has trouble communicating without the use of memes
that's a big no no
<@470822754262712329> hides behind a mask of hate and malicious irony to hide his insecurities
this ain't it, chief
<@470822754262712329> so I'll be your counselor today and be helping you work through it
he's getting counseling on it
absolutely fucking not
sorry <@470822754262712329> has trouble controlling his temper sometimes
Idk if I'm into that :/

<@470822754262712329> show me the board
talk like a proper human being right now or I will smack you with this here board
owo
so that's the kinda thing you're into, huh?
<@470822754262712329> I'm sorry for your cousin, that sounds painful
my nephew shat out a can of undigested alphabet soup that was more coherent than that sentence
<@470822754262712329> @ yourself
big oof
<@470822754262712329> you just realized?
you guys are kinda fucked up
<@470822754262712329> you need more creative responses for owo and uwu
talk like a proper human being right now or I will smack you with this here board
Owo
where are your parents?
<@470822754262712329> do you have any kind words for Alan, your creator?

Does <@470822754262712329> actually know what you're saying?
soooooooo why are you telling me?

I'm not carrying any textbooks uwu
I figured it'd be a bit less since we don't have to deal with as many class at once
Wait, yike, really?
Honestly your backpack will probably be the same weight as in highschool
Oh yeah
But I imagine I'll usually have at least one on hand
True
K, thanks fit the info
Yeah but you won't have to carry around most of them
F u n  t i m e s
Really depends on what kinda textbook it is
2-5 pounds ish
Does anyone know how much a college textbook tends to weigh?
As long as it's safe in the bag, it's probably worth it
Yeah I guess I can sacrifice some shirts for it
Enough room to safely do so at that
Pack it if you have room
I‚Äôm definitely bringing one of our smart speaker collection, the others are smaller but worse sound quality
My roommate wants me to bring one and we both like blasting music
ken says that's the first one
11 AM
Then I don't see the point in bringing it
So unless you can imagine taking it somewhere else to play it
Well I was planning to buy speakers for my desktop setup until I realized all I would do was annoy my roommate and dorm neighbors
Would it be a smart idea to bring my 2.2 lb, 130 cubic inch smartspeaker to college in limited trunk space if it's really good quality and looks impressive?
Idek
Is that the middle time slot?
12:30
<@&574247915518689281> what times are y'all picking housing on Wednesday?
High school gen chem and physics is probably enough for most people. Like, to Skyline's credit, they did just enough with the gen science classes for people to be familiar enough with the subjects that they're not totally foreign to them if it pops up in everyday life
I'm just so done with chem (and physics) for life
Damn RIP
That's even worse, whew thanks
Jane has 8:30 chem
Please someone else tell me they have a class before 9 so I feel better
Or to take an 8:30 class
It was either take a 9:30 class or take chem with what seems to be one of the worst chem profs at UW
i start at 10:30
I just didn't have the choice
Hey, I tried to too
alan avoiding the early hours like the plague is so funny to me idk why
WE'RE EVEN IN THE SAME QUIZ SECTION
<@478706068223164416> ALAN, WE HAVE MATH TOGETHER!!
Idk what memeology would be under lol
Global Men and Masculinity
Sex Work: the politics of sexual labor
There's a sociology class called Death and Dying
is there one
I want a course on memes
Still not sure how the first one has anything to do with feminism
Someone sent these:
HIST221: Food, Farming, Feminism covers ethical impact of US policies on rural farm communities and developing nations
HIST358S: Family Rights / Human Rights is about relationship between state, family formation, and individuals in the US in the past 200 years
it begins
oof
It does have some really obscure stuff
Hahahaha
Duke sounds like it has classes like Computer Science for Archeological Expeditions with Applied Physics
This one's Multivar calc for econ which sounds pretty interesting
I wanted to open up more math options for myself in the future though
202 is a prereq for two other math classes I want to take eventually, though it doesn't have to be this year
any reason you didn't?
Could have taken 3 other math classes that all start later
Actually no I didn't try at all
yeah
sucks though, having no other option in your case
Can't say I didn't try lol
I went out of my way to make sure I didn't have to do math at 8:00 in the morning
lol
I envy that 11 am start time lol
because there's only one lecture for it
it's also the reason I have to justify my schedule towards the afternoon
Nice
it's the first two quarters of cs put into one
accelerated cse
What's that class about?
Also that's a lot of CS sessions
Me too :(
I hate mornings with a passion
Congrats!
and this might be the only year i have a roommate who likes to get up early
i tried to avoid classes before 10 this semester but that math is only offered at 8:45 lol
woohoo secured all the classes i wanted
Wish me luck
About to battle for classes
Jkjk
Spoiler alert: war bad but sometimes made necessary
Alright I'm going to take a Poli sci class on the ethics of war
^
^
Sqrt 6
KEN I NEED ANSWERS
what's sqrt(2) * sqrt(3)
how do I do a radical
i finished that shit in like 20-30min and got max score
the AMP was the easiest test i ever took
I mean, yes, but also you still need to go see a doctor
Yes
or do I need to go see a doctor
this says 10 right
What if he shows up an hour late
I'm more concerned he has the wrong time
Alan stop complaining
Me too Gene
rip
Yo, my test was at 9AM
<@!105508293522264064> pls teach me radical modification
not that nervous but I am sketch on my ability to wake up in time for a 10:00 AM test
scheduled for an advanced math placement test tomorrow
Early afternoon
If I have only one class an entire day, what in your opinion is the best class time?
If I don't get into one I need to click on another super fast so I have to put them all in the bookbag
Why do we need to sign up for back up classes? Like, once we're in, aren't we in?
I have no fewer than 6 comp sci sections in my bookbag as backup
Replacing it with philosophy
I wanted psych 101 and it filled up super fast
I don't expect to take any useful or interesting classes until I'm actually in a major. Then I can take either HCDE or design classes and focus on a English minor and take the odd useful/interesting class here or there
Worst case scenario, I can always teach myself and focus on doing classes in other subjects that might be useful. Thanks, IB.
High school physics is honestly probably enough for game development tho lol
I'd probably rather take bio cuz I know the content or physics cuz that will probably be applicable to some game dev stuff, but chem is apparently the easiest, and the other two sound like a mess at UW
There's no AC and the ceiling is full of vents
I've done labs in that building before. It's a wreck.
Wow that three hour lab tho
But I'm a very inconsistent eater when left to my own devices
I just left gaps for myself so I had the option to
Honestly, idk when I'm gonna eat during college
The chem lecture I wanted conflicted with Design 150, and the one before it had an ass prof, so I guess it's back to waking up early for me
I usually eat breakfast at like noon and dinner at like 7:30 so
I just didnt want a morning lecture, but here we are
I just want to get to dinner early which is 5 pm
Haha alright that's a good standard
That's probably good
my latest is 4-6
My brother's main advice was "avoid morning classes as much as possible cuz you know you're gonna wanna skip them, and for the love of god, finish your classes by dinnertime so you're not coming home at 9:30 from a three-hour lab with no homework done while your floor is playing Smash Bros without you"
I really don't care if my classes are "late" tbh
Yeah that's the latest I have, hopefully
I wouldn't go much later tho
No
Would you consider a 3-4:20 class late?
UW draining that thicc $$$
But hey
Taking a calc series and a chem class are like the last things I need tho
Oh, and my CS prereq is alright. That can be interpreted either way, but I still think it's useful
There are some other requirements for first years in general, and for graduation though not specific to the major
CS just requires rudimentary math and coding knowledge
Only prereqs that make sense for what I'm taking are stats and English comp lol
Yep, I'm gonna def need knowledge of calculus and chem when I study UX
makes sense though since all of those are areas you should have experience in before
I don't get to take actual IR classes till I do at least 1 year of history, intro to polisci, micro and macro econ, and at least a semester of language
They're just major reqs, not prereqs
I guess comp sci and math are the closest things to prereqs I'm taking
I'm also filling prereqs to be clear
Right now I'm just standing alone in a lounge
But hey, it's no one's
At least I can still get comp sci and a math
I'm being forced to fill pre-req credits. Not my idea of a fun time.
Today was first registration day and everything got snatched up
If I want those classes I have literally no choice except times for the Monday class
Nice!
I went w this
mine's finalized
What mine will hopefully look like
Wow you guys have a lot of class sections
College is slowly turning into everything I didn't want it to be, but fuck it I suppose. I'll figure it out as we go.
Chem lectures at 9:30 AM still sound p gross tho
Everything else is "I'm gonna get something to eat" sized
Beyond those two gaps tho, I don't really have any awkward gaps
if that's what floats your boat
I mean
Are you kidding me? I'm gonna lounge around in public on Mondays and Wednesday
I'm not super worried about getting there on time all the time
mine are entirely in big chunks and most are back-to-back
idk about y'all but I was told that it is super not worth having classes with less than 2 hours between them bc you can't really get anything done in that time
I checked where they were. I picked the closest buildings possible. It's not optimal, but it's the best I could get. It's like a 5 minute walk cuz it's just like a couple buildings away.
Second day registration is ass
you seem fine to me though
otherwise, i'd be careful about making sure you have a time for eating
I had classes 10 minutes apart and i had to RUN between them
CHECK WHERE THEY ARE
this is kinda what im looking at right now
especially since one of them is like 3 hours long lol
im getting kinda concerned 10 minutes between quiz sections is gonna be miserable
cuz like high key
how long do y'all think it takes to get between classes?
"we're too ashamed of how bad some of our professors are, so we're just not gonna tell you which classes they're teaching in hopes you accidentally choose their class"
yeet
awesome. thanks
do whatever vibes w you
i did alternating days bc i wanna study in between but if you learn better by doing a lecture then applying immediately after ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
fuck chem 142, but oh well lol
got it ty
i guess
yeah
it‚Äôs not bad to take a quiz section the same day as your lecture. might be nice to have the material fresh in your brain. it just depends on how you wanna split up your week
so like, if i have a class in the morning and a quiz section in the afternoon, im kinda shooting myself in the foot if i didnt get the content from the morning, right?
probably quiz sections
do we take tests in lectures or quiz sections?
kinda like when we split up the class to do discussions or projects
quiz sections are more for small group things
and is it bad to take a quiz section the same day as a lecture for said class?
what exactly do we do in quiz sections?
i just finished a 1 hour 15 minute call with my brother in which i feasibly resolved my crisis and made peace with my situation, but now i actually have to schedule these classes lol
L
i would do C, but the prof for that one sounds like an L
i might do chem 142 B
lol rip
i wanna do chem 142 D with you guys, but it overlaps with design 150
chem is a weedout but saint nicholas says that it should be ok
ah, nice
should be p chill
nurs 201, chem 142, engl 131
what are you taking this quarter?
lol
oh, wait, what
later quarter lol
all the stats classes are full tho lol
stats is nice
it doesnt for some reason
taking stats in later quarter bool
but i'm not taking math
it should say when you pick sections
<@&574247915518689281> to those of y'all doing math 124, which class did you sign up for, and do you know if there's any way to tell who the prof is?
At least all your classes are on one campus lol
and god forbid I have to take calculus at 8 in the morning
so now the two math 124 classes available to me start at either 8:30 or 10:30
uw finally sent me my code to get into CSE 143X
but I had to rearrange my schedule for it
and then you'll regret this convo
someday you'll be an adult
someday helen. someday
I also have zero keys to put on it
I have one lanyard (from any organization) to my name
i have so many uw lanyards idk what to do with them
Welcome to college
I'm so bored and confused
How's A&O so far for you?
They gave me one at admitted students day too
I don't know what's with UW and lanyards.
I got a lanyard
But
It's so crowded
Ah
Guys UW kinda sucks
They need to label their axes
It's a badly written question
Yes
shouldn't it have a few more details to make the two graphs more distinct from one another
is that just a badly written question
new question
what if the graph of c is just scaled weirdly
In c, the asymptote is at 0. In a, the asymptote is at like 1 something. When x has a negative value, it approaches 0, not 1.
can someone explain to me why it's c and can't possibly also be a
Good luck, Emi
Rip I'm sorry
great i guess my english pre req might kill me
It's the only pre-requisite for the design majors, so they weed people out of that class hard
i feel like its russian roulette
how do you KNOW
It's the hell course lol
l m a o glad i didn‚Äôt
oh i was gonna do 166
Design 166 is the hell course
3-credit fall quarter intro course
which one is that
Design 150?
but i didn‚Äôt
oh hey i was gonna take a design course
it's the only fucking thing i've seen this school do right so far
bless myplan tho
this shit just gets more and more messed up. fuck uw engineering.
rip
YOUR BODY REQUIRES SUSTENANCE
lmao love the food reminders
the same schedule but in google calendar
My potential schedule looks really sparse compared to yours
I have a few classes I guess
Wdym
so are you like partially filled out?
I have yet to finish mine lol
Ooooo nice!
I've had it for like a month now
my schedule
haha
i'm dragging her then
cool
ah
she's been there two years and has never gone to a college party
wait how is that a favor for you lol
<@&574247915518689281> if you see Lily Liu this year, please do me a favor and bring her to a college party with you! Thx <3
I got a 4 on AP comp sci and that's how I found out lol
I got nothin to lose at this point lol
wow
in hindsight I'm like
I think I was like "what if I do badly"
good work
wow
....
yea but I don't think I did
i thought you could write it in on the test day?
ah rip then
oh
like this
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/504133721125945346/595649614015889424/image0.png?width=377&height=670
idk if I told collegeboard where to send them lol
if you got credits, they show
check your college unofficial transcript
"out"
are ap exam scores out
wait
But if anyone's equipped for this, it's you
Hopefully you get some then
Yike
also i'll need all the luck i can get lol
all good
Good luck
Yike I'm sorry
OChem is a beast
Idk anything about OChem at UW
Lol
I mean, to me at least
OChem is terrifying
Ooof
The only thing I'm signed up for at the moment is Engineering FIG and Design 150
... next year
Double weedout here we come
Yeah I might need to take OChem while doing the bio sequence
I'll look into that
Ooo ok
Everyone: Try not to take more than one weedout at once
Me: Makes sense
UW Engineering: Fuck you take 2 per quarter
The prof is apparently p good
If you feel like booling
Jeesoo and I are both chem 142 section D
Fair enough
I‚Äôll take it later if I need it
Probably winter and spring tho
Eh
Oh dam
Well idk when it‚Äôs offered bc apparently they don‚Äôt have it in the fall lol
Educational psych?
What's wrong with 220?
Quantitative methods
Ah
Both stats adjacent classes
Being serious tho, idk what either of those classes are lol
Sigh
That's a bad idea
Don't take meth
I can take QMETH or EDPSY
Then I might need to do a yeet
Well
I've heard the profs for 311 are oof
I have to do 220 or 311
In hopes that I never have to do them
So I'm highkey putting off my hardest engineering prereqs for spring lol
If I got into a design major, I could like bypass all the math shit, cuz the only prereq for that is design 166
Rip
I've heard stats 221 is p nice
And then I‚Äôll go get my ass kicked by physics
Rip I have to go through the Math 12x series
I think I need a single stats class
Oh, nice!
I DONT HAVE TO DO REAL MATH ANYMORE
Also I‚Äôm like fucking ecstatic that I did well on ap math
I despise all of this
Yup
It's apparently an engineering weedout too
I'm trying to decide between chem 142 and biol 180. I've heard the latter is harder and more time consuming, but I have more of a bio background than a chem background, so idk.
It‚Äôs a premed weedout
Chem 142
<@&574247915518689281> what science classes are you taking, if any?
Noted, thanks
Also, if you're in west someone says to go for a south facing window rather than one facing another dorm wall
I AM LOUD
End of the hall is better if you want quiet
It might be loud
Isn't a room by the stairs ideal if anything? What's the downside?
But having a room near the stairs means easier access to get the fuck out of the form
Cant be having a room near the stairs
Damn guess I'm doing it as soon as 11 AM hits
Not until then I don't think. Idk tho
Is there any way to like browse the rooms?
Appointment time is July 17 3PM rip lol
1:34
Yeah, you do that
Oh I got one too
ttyl
k i'm gonna get back to work
Really? Hm
1:53
i got another one
Lol thanks for trying
No worries
can't tell, sorry
Oh joy. This is exciting.
I don't think that's significant enough of a delay
hmm
12:21
what about you <@!340319804747415553>
I got my email at 12:24 PM
*We're sorry, you aint guaranteed shit! Have fun commutting loser*
Maybe they're sending emails out in waves again
ken hasn't either
Uhm
Uhm
I didn't get one either
I have not gotten one of those
Um
Have fun
L
that's my appointment
11?
july 17 11:00 AM
<@&574247915518689281>
Don‚Äôt be a stranger
Anytime dude
I might take you up on that that sometime
Thanks
also please get rest
if you ever want to chat about college and stuff, lmk
aw
But hey, maybe I just need some sleep, so fuck it
And I'm beginning to wonder if I peaked in high school
I am not the kinda of person that will survive in a college setting
I admit I have no idea what I'm doing and already feel like I screwed myself.
I dread everything about college yay
The more I let everything sink in, the more I begin to have regrets despite not having even done anything yet
plan 5: who needs security when you have dreams (yeet out of engineering from the start)
fall: who the fuck cares? prolly include design 150 (3) still, but beyond that, eh? english comp (5)?
winter: design 166 (5) and some filler bs
spring: probably still CSE 142 (4) because that's still good to know but i can actually fill gen ed classes here like a normal human being
pros:
-f r e e d o m
-this kinda brings a tear to my eye because it's so open
-this is everything i hoped college could be
-escape sunk cost fallacy early
-i can probably start working towards a minor earlier
cons:
-fuck
-if i don't get a 3.7 in design 166 or find out i don't like it, i'm gonna have regrets for a pretty long time
-this doesn't really feel like an option at the moment
-seeing how liberating this is in comparison to everything else just makes my situation feel even worse. i feel like i'm being punished for doing something well (getting into engineering)
plan 6: it's almost 3:30 and i still haven't registered what am i doing
just wait for everyone else to register, see what's left, and let other people decide for you
pros:
-i get to sit on my fat ass
cons:
-what the actual fuck
plan 3: b a l a n c e  -  e d g e l o r d  e d i t i o n 
same as plan 2, but flop biol 180 and english comp
plan 4: this is good in theory, bad in practice, but mainly fuck you for trying to make me an engineer when i don't want to be
fall (13-15): eng 101 (1), gen st 199, design 150 (3), math 124 (5), a class that won't make me hate life (3-5)
winter (12): **design 166 (5)**, english comp (5), ez bs shit (2)
spring (14): CSE 142 (4), math 125 (5), stat 121 (5)
summer/fall: math 126 (5), chem 142 (5)
pros:
-*inhales* *exhales* i can breathe
-i can pour all my time and energy into design 166
-fall quarter is the nice, soft landing that i want
-if i land a 3.7 in design 166, i can clear up the hell that's spring
cons:
-*IF* i get a 3.7 in design 166
-people will give me endless shit for this
-prolly don't have great chances in engineering apps
drafting out some potential plans cuz fuck UW
plan 1: what everyone keeps telling me to do but makes me want to puke
fall (15): eng 101 (1), gen st 199 (1), design 150 (3), math 124 (5), chem 142 (5)
winter (15): **design 166 (5)**, math 125 (5), english comp (5)
spring (14): math 126 (5), CSE 142 (4), stat 221 (5)
pros:
-engineering prereqs all done by the end of freshman year, can request HCDE placement sooner rather than later
-design 166 isn't surrounded by a clusterfuck of other weedout classes
cons:
-hahaha idk what math 125, but it sounds time-consuming, and i do NOT have time for that bs while taking design 166
-holy fuck spring quarter looks like STEM hell
-less credits in winter would be nice because design 166 is important if i want a design major
plan 2: b a l a n c e
fall (15): eng 101 (1), gen st 199 (1), design 150 (3), stat 221 (5), biol 180 (5)
winter (12): **design 166 (5)**, math 124 (5), finesse 2 credits (2)
spring (14): math 125 (5), CSE 142 (4), english comp (5)
finish math 126 in summer/fall
pros:
-play uw's broken system to my advantage and take classes i already know shit for in fall
-math 124 is less time commitment because i took SL2 math, more time for design 166
-only 12(!!) credits winter quarter! i might actually have a chance in design 166
-no one quarter looks downright dreadful
-B A L A N C E  B O I
cons:
-can't apply to HCDE until sophomore year if i go this route
-biol 180 is a weedout class full of premed students who prolly care more than i do
-starting math 12x series late is gonna get me some weird looks
-i'm gonna miss english if i put my english comp class that far out
UW: here's credit for biol 161 and 162 for completing ib bio! congrats!
me: oh, cool!
UW: 161 and 162 aren't actual classes btw
me: what
UW: you still need to take biol 180 for us to take any shit you do seriously
me: so like are these pre-reqs for biol 180?
UW: lmao no. anyone can take 180. again, 161 and 162 aren't actual classes
me: ...
Nice! Lol
lol i found out my ap cs score early because they got sent to colleges already
Lmao
the moment when you realize, AP processes digital score sends slower than Amazon ships physical packages...
like, everything about this lowkey hilarious to me, from the obvious apple sponsorship to just the sheer irony of them sending this to me to begin with
things to note:
-i'm not going to this school
-fam, i was admitted off of a waitlist, not like a regular admit lol
-i already did a survey for them that was sent to all applicants
ok, can i just say this is probably the strangest version of this i've gotten so far:
*triangles
here are fractions
it's like durr
it's an easy test ngl
<@!478706068223164416> they'll let you sign up for the math placement test for another A&O if you want. i did it yesterday, and i nearly aced it without studying. considering you're better than math than i am, it'll be no problem for you if you wanna take it
rip
but thanks lol
ib is fine
i mean sending in ap scores
<@!472541429130854421> uhhh you might need to get ahold of cw
I signed up for this shit literally last night
still need to send mine in
lol i forgot ib/ap scores were a thing
and also pray I get into CSE143X
nah it's fine, I just gotta WAIT longer now
sorry dude üò¶
I gotta wait for my BC exam to get back with at least a 3
üòÆ
fuck the ib
THIS GUY
GUESS WHO CAN'T REGISTER FOR MATH 124 BECAUSE HIS SL CREDIT DIDN'T EVEN COUNT FOR 120
thanks gene
Nothing's gonna close. It's the first week of registration. Don't worry, Emi. Things are gonna work out great.
i‚Äôm just so worried the class will close while i‚Äôm having technical difficulties :///
it made me drop engl 131 for the good part of the day and then let me enroll in it just fine when i got home
my plan has been having issues as of yesterday esp at uw
since we're gonna be in front of them
i would ask someone tomorrow
sorry idk
but since then it just kinda stopped generating schedules
it worked for me before and i even pinned the schedule
i tried swapping out the classes but it still doesn‚Äôt work
I could just be wrong tho
I'm p sure the quiz session is part of the class, so you still need the fig
Is that the class?
they‚Äôre not figs although one quiz section is marked figs only
I think that's probably the problem, but idk what it means
prob the add code problem
and i‚Äôm on the autumn quarter page
they‚Äôre all autumn quarter
none of them show the code symbol or anything. in the notes of one of my classes it said ‚Äúadd code required period 3‚Äù but idk what that means it‚Äôs not marked
you might also be looking at summer quarter
or password/faculty codes
Oh, that's smart
check fig restrictions
Especially if there's no overlap
Hm I don't think I know then
well i have 15 credits according to my plan
i checked that the classes are open, the times don‚Äôt overlap, there‚Äôs no restrictions, etc
Have you selected enough credits?
Idk if I can help, but worst case scenario, there'll be someone to ask tomorrow when they sit us down to do it
the schedule builder won‚Äôt generate schedules
What specifically is giving you problems?
well i wanna add classes to my plan and generate some schedules
Aren't we not supposed to do things on myplan until tomorrow?
i need myplan help
hi
yeah prob
i should read things lol
wait nvm im dumb
can i not like submit my own thing?

some of the stitches fell out
i thought your stitches fell out?
find courses on myplan was on the fritz when we tried registering
ok, but the thing is that like i have stitches in my mouth, and that's really out of my control at that point
technical difficulties are gonna be fun
laughs in can't eat burger
<@!193229269076279298> <@!503787499605458954>
oof
nice
im already a meme to the people who know me from A&O cuz i couldnt eat a sandwich properly
our acad advisor in our session lowkey was pissed
they had bad tech difficulties when we did registration
lmao ty
oh also
good work
i slept through the registration presentation today
good nap tho
rip
me: uh ok
"consent is sexy"
my orientation friends were like
when i asked what happened
lol
i feel like that's what all of this is tho tbh
i slept thru the health session
yea
yike
it is *really* not interesting
health/finance/acad success/etc
and then they just repeat a LOT of u101
lmao
you're dead 15 mins in
take a shot for every time they say balance
basically
wdym?
day 1 was p boring for me tbh
*balance*
it's a lot of
also, question about your earlier comment, but why was day 2 so boring for you?
thanks!

Today was an L
Day 1 was p good
Head desk
Orientation at UW
What are you doing?
Today is really fucking boring
Help meee
Sorry, I have plans with my family after A&O
Idk yet
Maybe.
please I'm gonna be lonely <@&574247915518689281>
anyone down to go for dinner around UW on Wednesday
no no no
no I'm done with that shit
<@478706068223164416>
The future is now
lmao for the third part of U101, they just used something made by stanford instead of using their own survey thing (which they have previously demonstrated that they have)
Do we really wanna know tho?
yes
There a UW discord that im missing out on?
Well, this is gonna be fun
Well this is UW I guess
ayy
Lmao mediocre minds think alike
that was my first thought too
For some reason I'm imagining people trying to play mini golf up there
fancy
Is it just me or is the roof of my dorm made of grass
oh found it
wdym?
wasn't there an email
<@&574247915518689281> how do we find out what our UW emails are again?
ok, awesome. thanks.
do the canvas stuff
do the input on transitioning into college
do the surveys
skim some of the reading
do the modules
like, how do they know that we did U101?
<@&574247915518689281> what the hell exactly are we supposed to do for U101? there's just a bunch of videos and then some links that lead to policies, but nothing asks us to actually do anything
Oh rip
So until I can get into another major, yike
I kinda have to take engineering pre-reqs, but I don't wanna be an engineer lol
and gene is in engineering
but that's gen ed
uw has i/s (individuals and societies), vlpa (art), eng classes + w-courses (writing), math/sci,  uh... *diversity*
Like?
I am actually dreading course selection cuz I need to take a lot of shit I reeeeaaally don't want to take, and it's not even gen ed stuff lol
Good save
Hahaaa just realized by accident that I messed up and am supposed to select three classes instead of four
Iirc it's locked until then
ah that'd make sense
^
I thought we had to attend our A&O first?
is anyone else have problem w building a schedule on myplan
<@&574247915518689281>
I'm not worried that much anymore
She seems to be taking it in stride and has like 3 other interviews lined up
She works in elderly care and nursing
She went off on her manager and ratted out all of her slacking coworkers
I'm sorry rip
oh nooo
Andddd now I‚Äôm sad :(
Tell her we said hi and give her my condolences
Ah shit
Awww I'm sorry. I hope things are working out alright. That's very sweet of you.
she was recently laid off by her problematic workplace and I wanna make sure she's fine
I'm spending the day with my mom\
I was in the middle of making lunch before running for diploma
I‚Äôm good but thanks for asking
@everyone anyone else wanna join for lunch?
Nice lol
I'm chilling in the band room, so I'm gucci
If you don't wanna wait you should probably go home lol
Oh lemme know then
Won't be there for a while tbh
<@472541429130854421> lemme know when you have your diploma, cuz I'm still at Skyline
There's one in the Safeway area
Sure lol
I'll pass on this one
Maybes we can go to some pho place lmao
If there's soup, I'm down
Where?
Anyone wanna go out for lunch after getting diploma
Hey hey
<@340319804747415553> lol hi
tea
Rip
But graduates from T Mobile
Too cheap to mail diplomas
fuck Skyline
Get it in August
what about all the people who are traveling rn and left right after grad
Found my driver's permit lol
Can't find my Id
stick it to Skyline
lol
so I feel like I'm just gonna not
also I don't care
Any ID
I highkey don't have a car today and also look like shit
Do we need to bring things like student IDs
lol
the bonfire
do we actually need it for anything
kek i have to go
"... UW?"
"from where?"
"running start"
I'd be surprised if they check
I mean you could just show up and say you're running start
Boooo
We have a special extension
Unless you're running start
oh I don't give a shit if I have to wait till aug
Cya y'all there
Alternatively, wait til August
Wanna go out for lunch lol
27 minutes, have a go
skedaddle then
cool i'm gonna
well better get out of bed then
Today's the last day
oops
9 to 12
I can double-check
This is what I've been told
you're fucking w us right
Yeah
wait wtf
??
They stop at 12
sigh ok fine
oh
when's the last
Cuz apparently today's the last day
Anyways, ima head out to go get my diploma
I love that
they were like fuck this and caught some shinies instead
my family took out pokemon go like an hour in
fucking icons
honestly
I could feel Courtney and Scott complaining about it and being really confused sections away when they announced it
i really wouldn't like her
based on what i heard from choir kids
idk her
lmao
If it were Pitt, maybe, but it was Ziebart
"howe"
I tried guys
yeah nevermind
I doubt that's what they were going for
free from the chains of high school
I mean that's what it probably intends but it could bei nterpreted as just like
it's a traditional church song
but that's what it's written for
doesn't *have* to refer to the christian grace
yep cornerstone of religion
was bound but now i'm free
but now i'm found
i once was lost
that saved a wretch like me
how sweet the sound
amazing grace
is it religious?
I literally have never paid attention to the lyrics
My reaction was "this sounds very Skyline orchestra, and I respect that this is how I'm finishing high school"
obvs :p
skyline is becoming a come to jesus school
top tier meme
Yeah
But also, why did they sing Amazing Grace?
also did you catch the orchestra playing the avengers theme on our way out
Tbf, I appreciate
rip the non-seniors there
lmfao
damn
Take a shot every time the jazz choir looks at each other realizing there's nothing for them to do for a solid two hours
SHANG
SA-SIN
SIDNEY
R I P
hahahaha
Take a shot every time they mispronounce a name
Take a shot every time someone stutters in a speech
lol
my sister was highly entertained by how he said that "skyline is oe of the most rigorous high schools"
take a shot every time he says failure
love her
ooooooooooof
hahaha courtney
he was afraid of being a failure at his job that he copped out of saying fuck
This was literally the first exchange with my family after graduation
My mom: Gene! Congrats!
Me: Sorry you guys had to sit through that
Courtney: It's ok. Scott and I were talking about how we could've turn it into a drinking game before realizing I would probably die of alcohol poisoning.
hennig is a hypocrite
actually if you think about it
lol
I doubt my family has it recorded
bc the guy showed up flying higher than a kite
susan loves recording speeches after her college commencement
Dear god, please send it to me if you do
i'll check with susan
i might have it
honestly if someone has it recorded PLEASE do
I'm gonna turn his speech into a copypasta one of these days
smh what a fuckin tease
f a i l u r e
fuckkkkkthiswinterbreak
"I'm gonna say the F word today"
fuck isd
it's ok we're done w them
ah
sigh
yes
Remember when ISD gave us 2 full weeks for winter break?
spring break is 3/6-3/15
I think I go back a day earlier
hey my dates are almost exactly the same
much better than high school
Lmao
my winter break is going to be like 12/17-1/7
üòâ
watch the wording bud
Congrats on finishing!
I miss food
yay food
time to eat
ok 3 hours and many rearrangements later I am done
the loveliest of crapshoots
I saw that and heard "Shooting Stars" playing in the back of my head
i live for glorified gambling
on a game
it's her pet
Also, what is that image?
it depends
And trying to fly in/out is horrible
usually people take a week
and an excuse to eat
okay that's fair
Thanksgiving is just a glorified weekend as far as breaks go
like this smol kookaburra
*i have so much to live for*
nah it's good lmao
pls don't kill me
I'm hurt
ily
jk jk sorry
can i give thanks for that :p
chances are my parents are gonna come visit me instead
I won't be home for thanksgiving though
lmao
I was about to say "president's week," but then I thought about it
I have a random week off in february
just come say hi anyway
if you ever come back
no fr though
inb4 canadia
not like classes like when my breaks are
I'm p sure my term schedule is gonna be p different from yalls
Personally I try to aggressively squish any time inbetween classes so I'm not left with random hours were I'm just kinda waiting around for class to start
noah are you texting during your final o . 0
all good :)
this chat is basically becoming my notes area for recording my thoughts lmao sorry
i guess i should try to do psych 101 since i'm probably taking more psych classes later
üëå
i was going to keep it out of laziness because it took a lot of effort to build that schedule but it's  probably better to put in more time now and not suffer the entire semester
I'm most likely going to trade out econ first semester, then take it second semester
which is when we do class reg
it's like uw a/o
ah
and more seats get released each day
but also ours is staggered across like a week
ok for one I'm lucky bc my specialization is kinda rare, I'm p sure the science classes are a lot harder to nab
oh rip
there are only two days
pretty much everyone registers asap when the thing opens
like how many different registration dates are there
wdym
idr
but over how many days?
helen said she got day 2
split
good luck
oh is everyone on the same day??
ah
classes get filled up super fast on the day of so it's better for me to get it all done early so i can just click the button on that day
my actual registration day is july 11
when's your actual date
are you just working on this bc I'm working on it lol
not sure how wise it is to have hard classes first semester
gooood luck :)
maybe i'll just say fuck it and take econ 101
that's fair
i might change out econ for psych 101 or something because i'm worried about the workload
it's spanish 204's fault üò¶
but you're way better at dealing w that than I am
your classes start p early oof
yea I vote #2
oh I see it got moved up
lol
the blue/purple just indicates whether it's in my bookbag or not
ok  think the second is better but what happened to the other blue box
this one is neater; i also have the option of moving the econ 101D from monday to tuesday morning at 8:45
I would try to put them closer together
idk if this is a good schedule
I just hope I can make myself be productive on my off days
I'm leaning towards the first so I can get rid of the awkward friday morning gap
they're honestly p similar
these are my 2 main options rn
from what I've heard from basically everyone, unless you have 2+ hours between, it's better to just have all classes in a chunk
susan had one friend (who ended up being a kinda manipulative creep) who did super well by scheduling no overlapping finals and even spread
i think the most important thing is the timing of finals
though it might actually be good for my productivity if i  space it out more
i'm also trying to group my classes together into one chunk during the day instead of having lots of spaces between
i don't really have an opinion, i think both have benefits. i would try to space mine out more if my schedule permits it.
"a lot" is relative it's still probably less time than a standard day in hs lol
do y'all think it's better to have a lot of classes mon/wed/fri and have 2 days basically off or to spread it out more evenly
rip
ok yeah that's pretty sketchy
OOOOOOOF
which isn't like *that* bad but also like oof
well when susan was there he was like 40 and dating a 25 year old
and I thought I had this decently planned out
I haven't even started on my business admin classes yet oof
ew it's been 2 hours and I'm still not done
rn my plan is to only take things I know I won't be able to waive w/ ib or ap credit, and if I missed any requirements I'll just do a summer session after
all the good classes conflict with CS 201 gbngnnnhfhgrhhjfhg
If you wanna actually learn Russian, it's best to do it back to back
fuck it I'm going full russian
do I take russian 1 sem and psych 1 sem or russian both sems
if it's grad students then i think that's alright
it's not that weird is it? how much older than them is he
np
thanks for the help ‚ù§
gl
ah
i'm already having to anticipate 8:45 classes on some days to avoid the almost filled up ones lmao
bc they're entertaining in the trashy fun kind of way
i just remember the bad ones
if i remember any more teachers i'll let you know
because i'm on the second registration day and i have no idea how popular some of these classes are
rip
right now my greatest fear is not getting the classes i'm trying to sign up for lol
wtf you bad at teaching
but like
Whoa
she basically pioneered jpeg
mhm
Convenient last name tho
Lmao
daubiches, although a fucking brilliant female mathematician, can't teach for shit and is called daubitches by students
I'm probably taking stats first sem bc the math class I want is filled
Oh no :(
like transfer out
fucking run
if you get venakides or daubiches for math
also
sigh
._.
but uh susan doesn't like him as much now bc HE STARTED DATING HIS GRAD STUDENTS
I was really hoping to have good psych classes
also the physics teacher arya roy is really good at teaching material
Oooooh good to know
susan really liked psych at duke
Will have to research more lmao
Psych 101 is very meh so I wonder if I can study a little beforehand and skip the intro class if I get it
it's p interesting stuff
i read thru a few units
Lmao
it's under my bed rn lol
<3
Oh God bless you üôè
i have one from susan's old business school friend
but that's also fair
It will probably come down to which one still has spots
lmk what textbook you need to have
I still vote econ 100%
if you do econ
Yeah I'm picking one
this should be fun
i'm doing like eng/bio/chem/math my first quarter
Econ is super difficult and potentially hard to get a spot in but it also just became a pass/fail class.
like picking between the three?
I'm also debating econ/philosophy/psychology
ah i see
Apparently if I don't place into CS I can just beg the Prof and he'll send a permission link
go mother russia
damn
I'm continuing taking Spanish
no idea what to expect except the the prof is apparently amazing
I think I'm gonna take russian as my first additional language lmao
also
hm
i read that shit wrong
actually
huh ok thanks
philo imo
I'm having a really hard time deciding for some reason, I feel like the second option is the obvious choice but professors and times look better for the first
should I take econ/polisci/philosophy (at risk of having to change later if I scored well enough on econ) or geography (it's not just where things are it's also like globalization and development)/sociology/polisci as my base seminars
me: :(
uw: no scores, no adv courses for you
Lol
bitch what
uw: think of a loan as an investment in your education
poorly written
but like
and it reminds me of mongolian
im doing my religion project right now
quite
Beautiful right
i really like the whole thing in retrospect
and how the H is just a line that intersects the E that just looks like an O
i like how the J is just a backwards C
it looks like my drawings from preschool
Yes
did you actually send in that signature?
Get some rest
Np
And thanks gene
Damn signing with a mouse is hard
Under the drop-down menu in the middle of the screen that says "send now"
Where is the hold for grades option?
it was on the senior survey
they haven't said anything to me about it
really?
requesting a second semester transcript
but they treat it similarly by pestering you a lot about it
nvm not a grad requirement
what is?
this is considered a graduation requirement for a reason
other than you're shit out of luck
I assume they have some system in place
like, that's how public schools work
they're not working during the summer
what if you need a transcript during the summer, what are you supposed to do?
do they just stop approving them during the summer?
so like just do it fam
it literally takes 5 minutes to request it
but like
although i guess they're still open a bit past grad
skyline counseling office has to approve your transcript request
why before you graduate?
good call
mmk
@everyone don't forget to send your transcripts via parchment to your colleges for second semester grades (select hold for grades) before we graduate so you don't get the big sad. inspired by my dumb ass forgetting to do this until today
can confirm: what's a money?
laughs in college econ textbook under bed
rip?
people (including past me) literally have no idea how the economy works it's actually really sad
ok now that I've taken econ I am of the STRONG opinion that everyone should take econ at least once
that's one more class down i suppose
lol
oh wait i just remembered there's an engineering course i have to take as a prereq too
i'm thinking maybe an econ principles course since i'm bound to take that at some point
i yeeted in a math and a CS class, but i have two more slots idk what to do with yet
yeah I don't really have to do much else
wow you have so many classes relevant to your major lol
even if that's the case though both classes will be easy mode for me
and I'm hoping I can skip both econs but I have a feeling I might not have done well enough on the APs
I'm also p sure I have to fulfill a writing component fresh year
micro and macro econ
polisci 1
intro to international politics
business admin: finance
business admin: strategic management
world history
what kinds of courses have you bookbagged?
lmfao
Bookbagging is literally giving me elevated heart rate and high blood pressure
Same bookbagging just opened for me
this is stressful
also idk yet what I'm actually allowed to waive based on test results
bruh class planning/timetables finally opened for ubc and I am Very Overwhelmed trying to figure out what my schedule is gonna look like next year
they emailed me about it a third time today lol
I'd max out the scale too but in the wrong direction
Lol I never took it
lmao
***A M E R I C A***
my cost thing was the other way around
oh I also took that survey, but as admitted-non-attending
bless state schools
lmao tfw your other choice was so much more expensive that the slider in UW's survey doesn't even cover the difference
colleges never have very good statistics with this stuff
Idk. Either way, it's pretty terrible.
...yike
well then
Cuz mathematically it's going to be higher
It just says 23% of students, so I don't know if that's just limited to women. If it isn't, it might actually be worse than the national average.
And UW is a public university so anyone can come on campus
Well it says it's close to the national average so at least it's like slightly better than average
stay safe out there guys
like a third of women get raped at some point so uh
Fuck, this is super recent too. What the hell.
I have no idea how to process this. That's honestly just terrifying.
I got halfway through, had to reread, and check that this was on campus.
The 23% stat is really uncomfortable. And the person getting death and rape threats is just really, really horrible.
UW all of a sudden seems hella sketch. Some of those things are downright terrible.
Holy shit
So I found an interesting article
https://komonews.com/news/local/former-uw-student-explains-her-online-rapist-list
make the tank your bed
just get a waterbed
Which thereby makes it logical
meaning it's not logic
this is circular logic
Sorry to break it to you but you're wrong
sorry to break it to you but that's bias
I don't think so
Have I ever suggested anything mildly resembling a bad idea?
I'm always a voice of reason
Excuse me
this convo was a rare instance where i'm the one spouting wildcard ideas and you're the voice of reason
W h y
Put the mattress in the shower
Sorry but no
No
That's
Replace your mattress with a giant tank
That's not how tanks work
Put the tank on your bed and sleep on your desk or in the bathtub
Hard to find a roommate who won't mind
Put it on your desk and do your homework on your bed
You'd be taking up a power outlet, making them sleep somewhere with constant sound, and get the floor wet regularly when you clean it just so you can have a fish derp around
Or forgo a bedside table and replace the area with the tank
Choose a roommate who won't mind
Not without pissing off your roommate
There's enough room for a tank if you try
Not enough room for a tank and keeping a fish in a globe is lowkey actually kinda cruel
Or bonzai trees
And start a succulent collection
I wanted to keep a pet turtle
You can have a goldfish I'm pretty sure
UW doesn't let you have doggo
But not doggo
UW lets you have a lot of things
Some do
I want a stove but that's definitely a no so mini fridge + instant pot seems like an excellent second choice
do dorms let you have instant pots
he'll just be rockin' the michigan bod
no, no
he ded
Imagine Jiayi at 230 lbs
Geez
Wait what
On the bright side, <@233062637922025472> , you might finally be able to donate blood!
Thanks gene
As long as the food tastes good :)
Either way, have fun in Michigan, Jiayi. You'll do great.
Good news: my brother spent four years in Michigan and was effectively the same weight, but mostly cuz he got tired of repetitive food after a while (as you will in any college)
No I'm between
You find people with either really good or really shitty (or inexplicably both at once) tastes in food from Michigan
Like, better than basically everyone here
And a surprisingly really refined taste in sushi
And only eats butter and salt pasta or cereal out of a mug
ah
The legend himself who grew up drinking two gallons of milk a day
This is pasta man
I mean
ah how the greats have fallen
As someone who knows a lot of people who've grown up in Michigan, the Michigan bod is a real thing. My brother's friend is like 230-240 (granted, he's 6'4" or something, and he weighed a bit less back in the day) was the star tennis player of his high school
but i love the description
i think you're serious
omg i'm cracking up
*certified michigan bod*
You think I'm kidding
hahaha
Don't each too much unless you want a certified Michigan bod
Also, the meal plan stuff is apparently a lot of comfort food
<@233062637922025472> 
Me: So I have a friend going to UMich next year. I told him I'd ask you guys for advi‚Äî
Sister-in-law: Oh god
Brother: *laughs* Good luck
roll up in august with your nerf guns and establish dominance over the other helen li
there can only be one
sad thing is i am not the only helen li at duke üò¶
nice!
that took a while lol
also i finally have my netid and email
lmao im dumb thanks
oh, i see it
you created your uw id already
you should already have one if you registered your netid
<@&574247915518689281> do we have uw ids yet?
better start saving some memes
Holy shite is Duke giving me this much OneDrive storage
that's how many
a mol lot of mole holes
A mol of mole holes
nah it was more like "lol if you have two mols of this and 4 mols of that, how many mole holes are in sammmamish during the spring"
"what is the chemical composition of water"
you need a 11/26 to test into chem 142
<@&574247915518689281> just letting y'all know that the chem placement test is hella easy
idk fam I'm confused too
Wtf
Uhhhhh
soooo are we getting credit then?
https://www.seattletimes.com/education-lab/washington-lawmakers-want-to-guarantee-you-can-get-college-credit-for-ib-classes/
Maple has Area 01, which I love and will make us of, but it's right next door to Lander. Alder has the district market, wand it's also right next to Lander. The reason I want Lander is cuz it's in the middle of everything and has good access to mist amenities. Also, Local Point isn't terrible to have downstairs.
Alder is where the food is, though everything in west campus is close together
Maple has a makers space under it, for those that care
Good choice in dorms, I approve
me going after them west-campus dorms named after trees, but i'm prolly gonna get placed in haggett or some shit cuz i have no trust in the system lol
and idk if i'd go even if i got in
i don't expect to get in and am kinda just prepared to go to uw at this point
like tisch is nice and all but like
that's kinda where i'm at too
i don't expect to get off the waitlist
i wouldn't go
but like tbh
stayed on vanderbilt's waitlist
i uh
im thinking i should prolly just ask my counselor tomorrow lol
so NYU's asking to fill this out, and idk if it's binding or not
Hmm I wonder why
in group, out group anyone
i feel like i could analyze the psychological  reasons that you chose to name this channel that
haha love it
There we go
Oh, hang on, I'm on it
in honor of d-day
I feel like another name change for this channel is in order
unlikely af
and seeing as i'm waitlisted
lol i wouldn't go unless they hand me the money
but yea if you're still hoping for a chance you can just stay on there
well, she might not be interested anymore
many schools don't accept ppl from the waitlist until after commit deadline
you keep yourself on the waitlist even after you commit
bc i committed but like 2 days ago i was like lol please keep me on the waitlist
need? why?
i might need to get rid of my vanderbilt waitlist spot
they keep spamming me and it's just bc I've been too lazy
lol it's just seattleu and nu now
I need to actually tell all the other schools I already committed
Lmaooo why tho
CMU is still asking for my financial aid documents even after rejecting my ass over a month ago
"I have a necessity to take leave from the general vicinity of Sammamish, Washington during the passing of the eighth month of the Gregorian calendar as the second-to-last complete seven-day unit occurs, more specifically within a general range around the twentieth twenty-four hour unit of said month."
yes, she could have
I don‚Äôt know dates
I‚Äôm sorry
You couldn't have phrased that worse
So also around 8/20ish
I leave end of second to last week of August
Big yike
damn that's REALLY early
I leave Aug 11
which I will do unless like bumbershoot is magically amazing this year or smth
week early for orientation
I go aug 23rd
they use the semester schedule
yep
damn, dats early
if i chose UW i would have probably done early fall start if my family didn't plan anything for september
orientation starts 8/20 for me
i'm debating whether or not to do early fall start at UW since UW starts so late anyways. if y'all are still around in early september, i might not in favor of chilling with y'all. but if i'm just gonna be kinda stuck while everyone's gone, i might as well.
just curious, for those of you going to college out of state, when do you guys start?
i guess it just means you get to add other people to receive the same emails as you
**?**
i  d o n ' t  k n o w
lol what
what's this
uh
yo, so UW squad
they didn't ask for a deposit which is hella strange
yeah i just committed
duke lol
Wait where are you going?
comp sci. already made the decision to transfer to arts/sciences. i'll just need to write a paragraph explanation
What do you want to do ultimately?
i spent the last week figuring out whether i wanted to transfer from engineering to arts/sciences or not
welcome to the planning mania
lmao
i already planned 2 years of classes
nah
is it bad that I'm already planning out things to do in vancouver
petition to rename this channel? we're not applying anymore
o.O
i can't get into the nu app status check anymore
uh
ooh fancy
but bc ib credits are worth more in canada, and I'm v willing to do summer sessions, there's a good chance I can shave off a year
ubc has a 5-year bachelor's + mba program
how do you do a masters in 4 years ._o
also random question
did not need to know that
i
a fun fact I just learned: part of fifty shades was filmed at ubc
*laughs in dead*
lmao rip
**tries to laugh in ibcp but chokes on french toast instead**
I wonder why
why do you sound like salina
laughs in Running Start
lol
i don't deserve sl music credit tho lol
i want my sl math credit
dying in HL
laughs in
rip you
yeah
same
i guess it's still a transition period
i remember a bill being signed in last summer for sl credits
yeah
huh
they're reviewing it
as of right now no
does uw not take sl?
wait
F
tbh it probably will be partially redundant if you can't get credit
i don't get credit for SL math (or AP stats since i'm not testing), but i'm concerned it might be redundant with something at UW lol
cuz like
hey, so will stuff in college class overlap with what we've done in ib classes
https://old.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/a36qpi/master_allowance_thread_for_2019/
more specifically this
<@!460689096646590465> ran across this https://old.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/
lol i wish
that's why you have two years to decide!
do the big think
ü§î
agreed
ü§î
ok, i highkey have no idea what i wanna study in college anymore lmao
I know I said this earlier today, BUT CONGRATS! SO HAPPY FOR YOU!
Revel in the novelty
Haha I feel that
I'm like vibrating
there goes my attention span for the day
‚ù§
Gratsssss :)
I'm so relieved
thanks queen
CONGRATS OH MY GOD
WOOOOOOOOOO
FINALLY
TO UBC
I GOT IN
we're all bad together
don't feel bad about college
also
when I felt like it
when did noah become a wheel
$34,000 base
The GLA is the cheapest Mercedes-Benz you can buy new in the US
I was wrong
But I‚Äôd also be down for the pole dancing classes even tho I am a weak ass bitch lol
Also I‚Äôm very late
What an interesting convo
Rip
Uh
I know I'm late but g'night
night all
ah fun
I think I'm actually gonna try to sleep now
I need to be up in less than 5 hrs
I need to go sleep for 8hr to feel ok again
so it's like one run and that's it for the day
it's just a very all or nothing thing for me
jesus
I've blacked out and thrown up after running before
long distance is so boring tho
I like hiit
but seriously fuck it
but is is satisfying at the end
same!!
fuck running
running
what's a form of exercise you really don't enjoy
really depends
sometimes...
exercise is fun
but I feel like it'd just be fun
I mean I'd love to take actual classes too
but is also kinda boring
which makes sense
all the party stuff seems to be more for the performance side of pole dancing and not the workout side though
F
slight tangent, every now and then I remind myself that my 18th birthday is probably gonna be during my 1st finals week of college and get sad
I agree
these descriptions are great
ok I'd wanna do the pole one
lol
if I have money later maybe I'll do it for my 18th
I would be SO down for this
https://www.polefitnessseattle.com/parties.html
ok tbh
I always forget that you did gymnastics
and lead as fuck
the man was pure muscle
a guy called Andrew at our first gymnastics gym
na
It was prolly Gabe then
wow surprise
I don't think he can even do one
no
was it your brother
or at least the only person I've ever known that could do one was
to be fair just doing an iron cross is sexy
hell I want to see someone try and do an iron cross while looking sexy
display of grace and sensuality
Why anything
it's just become a cultural thing idk man
why not rings, or like parallel bars
Then why
they don't, technically, I mean they could just take their clothes off
why do strippers need poles actually?
it's fuckin hard
like I would wanna learn even if it wasn't a stripper skill
pole dancing is lit tho
Like why do you need a pole to strip
because strippers do it
like Nicholas can barely do one
I still don't understand why pole dancing is associated with stripping
but that's hard as fuck
only thing I've ever wanted to learn is doing a flag on a pole
in the morning
The only way to confirm
but like
I might actually
NOW send her the screenshot
Lmao
aww
I'm both relieved and disappointed
I checked w create an account
it did not
Chrome mistook it for intermediate pole dance
or that, but I doubt it, she sucks at being responsible w passwords
you can just check if the email has an account attached to it
I guess chrome just thought it was something else?
password changed?
wait
:)
bruh I'll kill u
or should I instead?
Log in and sign up for shit?
y e s

Lmao send her the screenshot
people please, practice good browsing habits
Wow
ah she's not very smart then

she's been signed into my laptop before so I think some of her shit synced
that's her email

why bother w asterisks in the first place
so I needed six

the numbers of * should correspond to the number of letters
ah no
oh I thought you were just arbitrarily editing the asterisks
I can't get the formatting right
Idc really about people knowing or not. UW's nice but not a huge flex to the point that it makes me uncomfortable
bruh
I could care less about the ***************, so why would I

...
*however*
however,
because I am joking
ok I can't tell are you actually taking this personally
Especially when you talk about Nicholas
about what?
And always
Now
when have I ever come across as a hoe?
are you sure
Noah, your cover up is bad
I'm not a hoe
doesn't mean you can't be one too
I am A hoe
I thought you were a hoe not me?
yes
did you just call me a hoe?
I am safely alone and faaaaaaar from this hoe thank you very much
<@193229269076279298> Give Cindy her phone back
it's rare, but it happens every few months
That's the exact same thing he said earlier
she agrees
see
^
Oh no
it puts things in context
I mean
Stop with the cars lol
?
N o a h
plus a car down payment
`assuming 40k tuition`
so yea it's enough to make up the difference
Not OoS tho
and the difference was $123,448
assuming 40k tuition
uh that's $134,400 over 4 years
that's enough to pay almost half of college if you're going by $2.5 per month
That's not nearly enough for college
How often are visits?
per visit
ok but
Only $200-300?
good to know
well, doesn't actually look that difficult
indeed even has options
damnnnnn
lol
Oooo spill
but I feel like I've already done so many sketchy searches today lmfao
ok I'm really curious and kinda wanna search `how to find a sugar daddy`
So what if I like give you a $100 bill to grab lunch at a nice restaurant with me and you have like a few cents leftover as change, but I tell you to keep it for your time cuz I don't like coins?
that would be more sugar daddy like
there's a difference between covering a friend for a hangout and employing someone to spend time w you
not just take me to do things
<@193229269076279298> ``there is no heterosexual explanation for the way you talk about your brother's muscles`` Is she saying that I have a chance?
you have to pay me is some form
anyways <@!258094439636008971> i would say no
there is no heterosexual explanation for the way you talk about your brother's muscles
you're right, Nichola's arms are better
So if I ask Noah to hang out with me, but he's short on cash, is he considered an escort if I cover like a movie ticket and lunch to hang out with me?
that's not what that Means and you know it
see Nichola's arms
why buy arm candy when you can just make your own
I mean I did say `often selling sex`
I used to be really confused by it
so most people treat them interchangeably
escorting is generally associated with prostitution though
it's pretty self-explanatory
why
I'm disappointed in myself that I actually know what arm candy means
I agree with that
escorting = selling your time/body, often selling sex, but usually people call them escorts and not prostitutes when it's a bit higher class. sometimes they'll get hired to just like spend time w someone or be arm candy for an event
So can I hire an escort to make it look like I have friends?
She's discussed that already
just get a sugar daddy
prostitution = selling sex
<@!460689096646590465>
wait
ok lemme just
It isn't?
prostitution is
escorting isn't always sex either though
If you say so
also shorter
Oh
escorting
... which one?
one is easier to spell
semantics
Between escorting and prostitution
whatever
if they're not getting paid
the second part was escorting
or just regular consensual sex w a client
Someone explain cuz I'm dumb but what's the difference
the first part was stripping
it's just escorting
but then it's not stripping
it's not part of the actual job description
they could choose to go home w someone
I mean like
usually?
<@!503787499605458954> `stripping usually doesn't involve actual sex`
Of course Vegas
guess who's moving to vegas
vegas bbaby
^^
yee
So it's legal?
sometimes you get naked
stripping usually doesn't involve actual sex
no
no
And is stripping considered prostitution by law?
oh my god yes <@!503787499605458954>
yes, and that answer is no most of the time
yes
<@!460689096646590465> wanna go to a pole dancing class w me sometime
Do prostitution laws vary by state?
do you know me
i'd use that extra money for college noah
i'd rather strip and sell sex than go to uw
and just pocket the extra money
actually do all three
and the correct answer is both
or go to uw
its either strip or be a prostitute
all im seeing here is i should do it
a lot
the answer is it varies
Wow
That
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/college-student-stripper_n_5474016
its in irvine which is next to LA thank you
I feel like "a lot" is very relative, the majority just strip but ok
I ask because I fully expect Noah to have a very specific answer because I know he's probably looked into stuff like this for covering for that Lamborghini
Real question: how much do male strippers get paid
the money is really in escorting
same goes for porn
a lot of people use stripping as basically advertising for escorting
UCI is not in LA
strippers are usually not also escorts what
and if you're only stripping or also escorting
i'll be in los angeles
depends on the area
I'm dead serious about learning how if I ever need to
but it pays pretty damn well
that can't be your only source of $$$
Also, idk if I mentioned this earlier, but we were talking about it earlier, so I might as well say it now: I don't think stripping nets enough money to pay for college. I might be severely underestimating how much strippers get paid though.
not gonna happen for a looooong while if ever
anyways long story short unfortunately free college in the US is ridiculously unrealistic in today's day and age
But still
that was just some shit his supporters came up w
I know
that wasn't his actual slogan
Also, "feel the bern" is still the most hilarious slogan I've ever heard to this day
lol
yeah cindy probably has better reasoning but i don't trust him because i feel like if we put too much pressure on him he'll just shatter into a million pieces
Idc for him myself tbh. I just brought him up cuz he exists
but I'm not going to bc it's not super relevant
about why bernie sanders is a trash candidate
I could go on a WHOLE ass rant
ok
Aren't we all
i don't trust it
he's frail
Bernie's running for 2020
its okay i just want to study fairy tales and promote communism
tl;dr I'm sorry emi =/
I've been lurking for a bit but it took me like 10 mins to read through all that
I'm not going to
communism is: "ohana means family and family means no one gets left behind" CHANGE MY MIND
In the wise words of 5th-grade Albert Zhong, "Even if communists got their ideas to work, they still wouldn't be able to implement them. People wouldn't take them seriously and just say, 'LOL COMMIES'"
hello
*no*
communism is just donations on steroids
I want a 4c
I don't want the same stuff as everyone else
yeah okay fuck US 1950s era we don't need you to stigmatize SHARING
And a meme
sounds great to me
It's taboo and stigmatized
everyone gets the same stuff
so why do we hate the communists
Aside from stigma
Nothing
im just gonna say fuck it and ask what's wrong with being communist
_marx was right_
Maybe that Marx and Literature class at UW might be interesting after all
_it's capitalism_
its not even skyline's fault that im suffering rn
Tbh, Skyline admin doesn't have to do shit to our grades for us to get screwed over
and by golly does this speak VOLUMES to me
stories are meant to critique the condition of society
well it aint far from the truth
Y i K e
i just finished a book about a girl who got screwed over and didn't get into any of her colleges bc her school's headmaster purposefully changed her transcript so that all the rich kids that donated to the school got into their first choice schools even though they didn't deserve it
One thing to note is I don't think stripping's gonna cover a college education
no one asked
thanks noah
meanwhile i'll just endure 4 years of academic decay to my brain cells
yeah let me wait another 20 years for my life to start
Ok, that doesn't solve the problem
There's always grad school?
hi salina
They're probably p illegal ideas
i would literally fuck every single guy at uci if it means i can afford it
actually nvm
we don't need to get into the weird side of reddit
hey emi
please enlighten me
rip
<@193229269076279298> I'm p sure that confirms it's worth twice as much to her
lol, I have suggestions but I will withhold them
do you _know_ how much i want this education
YOU THINK I WONT ACTUALLY SELL SEX FOR COLLEGE
YOU THINK IM JOKING
<@193229269076279298> that's your cue
C-Class starts at $41,400
Also, I mention kidneys cuz you can sell one and stay alive cuz if the other but not your liver
maybe i'll find myself a sugar daddy
damn
i always joked about it but
oh my god i have to strip for a lviing
im gonna sell my kidney
Really?
lol no it's not
comfortably
Emi, no
you can't live in a mercedes
A Mercedes is way more than a condo
THATS WHAT IM GONNA DO
I"LL SELL MY KIDNEY
heart is 1 mil, liver is $557,000, kidney is $262,000
so like yeah they'd get me a mercedes
also gene my parents feel so sorry about not being able to send me to uci that they'll buy me an apartment if i asked
I looked this up about a year ago
And yes, about 250k
<@193229269076279298> Nah, that 640k is just how much it takes to bribe a USC crew coach
let me check
kidneys are what 250,000?
I think that means we have a problem
unless this is a case of 230,000 for UCI and 410,000 in "extra curriculars", i.e hookers, blow and at that cost a yacht too
The cost of going to college at some schools for four years is more than what you could sell a healthy kidney on the black market for
it was a mix of the 260000 and 64000
like what is gods name are doing with that English degree
Presumably
From accidentally typing another 0
I still want to know where 640,000 came from
<@460689096646590465> oof
But yeah. Considering that it's her parents' money, she's not gonna put the money she's saving by going to UW into buying a Mercedes even if she wanted to cuz they won't let her. In addition, whether or not she had that money is in question itself because we're discussing financial aid at the moment.
my life is a h rn
ahhhhhh
Sometimes spelled as "hhhhhhhhh"
It's frustration with a sound
h?
i still have a little brother (who, mind you, doesn't want to go to college but this is an asian family)
h my parents retirement don't remind me
and sadly we're not in Europe where the wonders of public transportation has been discovered
If she were to actually save the money by going to UW, it'd probably go towards her parents' retirement, her living expenses, and maybe a couple luxury items for her and her parents (but not a car)
you're right but what am i gonna do with a car
uh Uber is really expensive compared to driving
i don't even Plan on driving in the future
i could uber for the rest of my life
that is So not a fair comparison
<@193229269076279298> college
I don't know if the cars are a fair comparison tho, because it's not like she's taking the money she's saving to buy a car
which would you choose
buy a lambo or go to college
To me, the cars were less of a perspective thing and more of something that just made me laugh cuz it's you and cars
also I like cars
also I think cars help put costs into perspective
that's my point
Well, I guess she hasn't explicitly said it, so that's fair. I could just be reading too much into what she's saying.
How come?
I don't know if she has made that clear
Honestly, she's made it pretty clear that it is worth twice as much to her in a vacuum and that it's more of a question of whether or not she can afford it at this point and whether it's worth the financial risk
do you think you'll get 100% more value out of it
well is UCI worth twice as much to you is really the question
I'm gonna be honest, I laughed, and I feel terrible for doing so.
noah that's not helping lol
4 years based on average total yearly cost
UCI: 227,240 (i.e Lamborghini Huracan)
UW: 103,792 (i.e Lexus LC500)
difference: 123,448 (i.e Mercedes Benz Amg Gt)
<@193229269076279298> This better be a huge-ass text wall cuz you're taking a while to type, and I'm really interested in what you have to say all of a sudden
No worries. Let me know if there's any other way I can help. Hopefully it works out.
that's really helpful
i will do more research on it and talk to the financial aid office
thank you gene
(and also some Reddit threads on student debt I've run across in my time)
Source: I did my math IA on student loans and did not fail
The rule of thumb with a loan is that your average annual salary for your major should be equal to or more than the amount of debt you have coming out of college. That can be alleviated prior to graduation with a job on the side or something. 
Keep in mind that I'm not in a position as your friend to tell you to take on debt, but there are options to via federal loans if you wish to do so. I think your dad is wrong on this one off of a hunch. If you want to check that, I would call the UCI financial aid office.
i don't know about work study bc there wasn't a loan for that
but he's explained to me that i can't take on the loan
i asked my dad so many questions already and im still so confused
It might be worth asking for specifics. Depending on the loan, you could take it out yourself and/or pursue a work-study  or something of that nature
yes
Have you talked about this with your parents yet?
30k?
40k annually?
all i know is that i have enough in my funds to pay for UW and graduate without debt
How much can your family put towards your education annually (if you're ok sharing. If you're not, I understand)?
260k please
ANYWAY ITS A LOT OF MONEY
Yike
000000000
Emi, I think there's one too many zeros in thers
260000 over four years
640000 per year
That's the number you put up above
no
wait
yeah
120000 i think
idk whatever UW costs
2200000
640k?
Wait
a lot
wow that is
$120000? enough to pay off all four years of UW
jesus fuck emi
If you're ok with me asking
they didn't give me any government subsidized loans. they're asking my parents to pay for all of it. i don't even get to take on the loans myself
How much money could you put towards college in your current situation?
my whole cost for four years? $640000
$30k is just the out of state price
do you not have any GET fund saved up
$30k?
you could... take on the loan yourself?
What would be the total loan?
Im sorry, emi
i can go to uci if i want it that badly, and i want it. So Fucking Badly. I just hate to make my parents go through finding a loan and paying 3k for a whole decade
I think that makes a bit more sense
i think all of this just shows that she wouldn't be happy at uw
it's that period of transition that matters
but the thing is that even if she can get herself to the same end point
i don't doubt that emi has it in her to be successful, whether it's uw or otherwise
I apologize if I'm missing the point.
im sorry gene
I might be. I'm working with a bit of a headache.
just a bit
i think you're kind of missing the point
gene
The program doesn't make the student. The students make the program. UW's not gonna stop you from being successful or talented in any way.
the point of trying so hard during college applications was to make sure i wouldn't have to resort to uw
they sent me _books_
two of the most prestigious highly regarded private liberal arts schools in the nation accepted me
im so overqualified as an english student
that's fair but
Not all diploma students got into UW
UW's not easy to get into
all i had to do was slap IB onto my transcript
did it
Tbf, the hard work you put in got you into UW
i know uci just wants my money but their classes...they're so beautiful
if i had known that i would end up at uw regardless of whatever i did, i would've slept a lot more and taken a lot more classes that i liked and did a lot less auditions
It's ironic that state-school education is meant to be affordable but all it really does is screw over out-of-state students
i know the world isn't supposed to work fairly but damn this is rough
'murica-levels of gross
how gross is it that i might actually have to sacrifice a well deserved education that i already love so much just because i don't have enough money
Aww, I'm sorry, emi :/
deciding on a minor is the least of my problems rn
It's the only true weed-out class for design majors to my knowledge tho, so it's not really something that should stop you
Correction: it is a weed-out class on steroids
perfect
Design 166 sounds like a weed-out class on steroids
i think murder is a great idea
with everyone else
bc im going to uw
right
Just don't try to murder me if we're put in the same Design 166 class cuz the people there sound scary
Yeah, np
Also, design 166 would be the only thing you'd have to take freshman year for a design major, so plenty of room to explore or do reqs
thats actually really helpful bc im considering design
thanks gene
take what you will
but it also hates all of us
i think it hates you
Design 166 is supposed to be hell. Once you're in, it's smooth sailing.
Design 166 is offered winter and spring quarter and is cutthroat cuz a 3.7 in the class gets you into a design major of your. If not, you have to do a one-day workshop in June where you basically show up with a work you've made and hope to impress someone evaluating. Once you're in, you have some p cool class choices, and it's no longer really super cutthroat.
I'm personally looking at Interaction Design as of right now. There's some other cool stuff.
wella ctually
why does the universe like to toy with me like this
it doesn't
why does the universe hate me
it's your reality but not necessarily mine
l u c k y
but it's less crazy for me
i know
its not exaggerated we did the calculations
and also more of a "here take most of the loan yourself"
no debt and horribly bland classes, or HELLA DEBT and _wonderfully mind stimulating classes that wont make me want to hang myself in my own dorm_
yeah that's my dilemma too, except less exaggerated
yikes?
if i go to uw, i graduate without debt
if i go to uci, my parents will have to pay 3k every month for 10 years
i don't know anything uw didn't even give me my major
get some hard skills worth toting around
get a technical minor
Yeah
any advice for design minor
I'm sorry, emi
lit and discourse on the enviro
<@460689096646590465> if you wanted to switch to a design major, that's a choice you're gonna wanna make p early just a heads up. I say this as someone looking into one
i feel like a gold fish tied down by a rock
but that's prob not your turf
there are a handful of great courses that would be fine for me at uw but its nothing compared to uci its so limiting and saddening
i would totally jump on the lit and med course
i love english and i love literature but god please im a creative intellectual i deserve colorful courses where there are no right answers and only brain cell discussions
studies in popular culture
Lit and technology, rhetoric, cultural stuff, Asian American literature, theories of imagination, Marxism, modernism, postmodernism
bad boy satan :p
but hey hey hey
but that's also kinda religiousy
Milton could be cool
just throw the whole english major away
if i have to read things fall apart again im switching to a design major
jk
no
like my sanity
things fall apart bitches
my new FOA topic
black literary genres could be interesting
love it
yeah study the rhetoric of jesus
for they shall inherit the earth
okay uci has that course too
blessed are the meek
oh God
the bible as literature?
i'd rather do science fiction
don't make me do marx
pls i can't do marx
but i don't think i'd be able to take it with a straight face
they have a spring program where i could just go to london and study at king's college
also there's a marxism course
yeah ive been thinking about that
study abroad program
there's a
<@460689096646590465> hang on, I saw a few. Lemme check the list again
<@193229269076279298> Oak: Now is not the time to use that
i love you emi
lmao emi
well fuck you too
SOME PEOPLE DONT LIKE SCIENCE FICTION NOAH
sh noah
what is with uw and science fiction there's a whole student run literary magazine published at uw on it
***what***
don't say science fiction bc its my least favorite genre
_what else would i want to take_
lol chaucer
Beyond a couple Shakespeare reqs, do they really require stuff on dead white guys the whole way through? Like a couple of those classes sound boring (see: Chaucer), but would they let you take something else instead?
and it's *kinda* in the med arena
and i think i'd be good at it
and it has a lot of career potential
bc i like the program
and i think i might have to sac two summers for summer session
y i k e but why
yike
it's a tight squeeze
i'm trying to fit two co-ops into a double major program into 4 years
lol no
im sorry salina
i think i might be screwing myself just a lil bit but it's ok
if i go to uw i have to talk about dead white guys for another four years and spend two years wandering around like an idiot because I ALREADY KNOW WHAT I WANT TO DO
also i've already started planning my schedules and stuff
I'm glad to hear that
i've come to terms with the way things are
i have a good backup
lol don't be
i think you could make it but it sounds like you really wouldn't be happy there
Also, I'm sorry, Salina
I'm sorry, emi
but anyway
also another friend of mine who i expected to get into cs also got fucking rekt
got screwed
laughs in
UW would almost certainly let you into the English program if you applied. They just don't admit direct to major cuz UW is an ass with major admissions in generals
I want to real about some old white guy's mathematics
okay fair
it was never interesting in the first place
NOT TO MENTION THAT I GOT INTO IRVINE DIRECTLY INTO ENGLISH WHILE UW DIDN"T LET ME IN
Most of the seem p bland (some of the 200- and 300-level stuff seems p interesting though)
bc my good friend derrida is also full of bullshit
because reading about dead white guys' musings gets boring after a while
why though?
I see what you mean with the courses though
The diversity requirement was something that students at UW actually pushed for
rip?
uh
AND ALL SCHOLARSHIPS THAT INVOLVE STRANGELY SPECIFIED ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS
ALSO SCREW RICH PEOPLE
rip?
i call bullshit on their "you must take 5 credits of some kind of course that involves looking into marginalized groups because we Care About Diversity"
not to mention the lack of diversity in the uw english department
tell me if im wrong
for the love of god
please
http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/engl.html
https://www.humanities.uci.edu/english/undergrad/course_desc.php
there's course blurbs
unlikely
Maybe the courses are interesting and they just have bland names?
i don‚Äôt deserve 4 more years of ‚ÄúLiterature: Composition‚Äù
rip?
I AM BETTER THAN THIS
screw uw and it‚Äôs lack of creative and brain cell stimulating english courses for overqualified liberal arts students
because the brothers grimm were some sadistic fuckers
Well, I guess prestige is p arbitrary to begin with
violent mermaids
nothing quite like uh
if uw really is better than uci in english well then i say fuck prestige i want to spend a quarter analyzing the little mermaid
rip
maybe it ranked third in 2015-16 sure
h please
I thought UW's English was fairly well regarded?
there‚Äôs like a couple classes like intro to fiction and one on science fiction
Why?
please kill me
but oh my god. uw
not to mention a required class on some ethnic literature bc diversity right
probably electives. every english major has to go through some kind of literature and composition and shakespeare torture
Are those core courses or English elective courses?
please recall the topic of my FOA
includes: ‚Äúrhetoric of free speech and expression‚Äù ‚Äúhollywood vs hallyuwood‚Äù ‚Äúhope and hopelessness‚Äù ‚Äúhamlet and revenge‚Äù ‚Äúrevisiting fairy tales‚Äù ‚Äúchildren‚Äôs fiction‚Äù and a whole ass course Just on unreliable narrators
Sure
so let‚Äôs talk about uci‚Äôs undergrad courses for english
Wdym?
it‚Äôs the academic equivalent of a prison
i‚Äôve never been so offended in my life
i‚Äôm looking at the courses that uw offers for english
you said it not me
you have no right to look so smug
....
;)
inb4 everyone walks around w a "fuck noah" t shirt shortly after
dew it
should I wear a "I got accepted into UW" sweatshirt at WSU?
I'm going to WSU
hey
but yes! go emi!
rip wsu and western lmao
except for wsu and western bc why would i
i‚Äôm gonna buy a sweatshirt from every college i got into and wear it around uw
thanks guys
Point being, we care about you and honestly it breaks my heart to see you be hurt like this. There's nothing wrong with being hurt because those emotions are perfectly valid, but it's also important to pull everything back together too. I really do think the future has a lot in store for you and I hope you can see that for yourself too.
Emi, I know it's really frustrating and downright devastating and I'm really sorry that you're going through it - I know where you're coming from.  I was so angry and ashamed after getting rekt by admissions too because I feel like I've put in way too much to end up falling back on what I considered easy ins/safeties. We appreciate you and know that you are a really hard worker with a lot to show.  Be kind to yourself and know that you can make the most of what you have. Maybe this isn't the most helpful to you, but one thing that really helped me was looking into cool opportunities/programs/extracurriculars... also a lot of shopping... and I mean a lot.
laughs in also got fucked by college admissions hahaha
I say this fully believing that each and every one of you deserves the world. Don't you dare think any of these past few years have been a waste; you're hard workers, talented people, and wonderful friends, and that's all a result of what you've done up until now. I know things might be rough right now and the future may not have been what you originally hoped for, but I don't for a second worry that you won't be able to find success or happiness in your future, because you all have everything you need to find your way in life. So when things get rough, remember that there will always be people in your life to support you to the next bright spot, because there will always be people who will genuinely want to support wonderful people like you and there will be success waiting for people as talented and hard working as you guys. I couldn't be prouder of you guys and happier to have met y'all.
I understand you might not want to talk at the moment, emi, but I've been meaning to tell you guys this for some time, so maybe it'll helps when you're feeling better and want to read it. Regardless, this is both you and anyone else here who needs it:
You guys are some of the most wonderful and talented people I've ever met, and I say that from the bottom of my heart. With each and every person here (yeah, even those of you who lurk or don't check this channel), there's always been a moment where I stopped to look at you and wonder how you do the things you do.
Unfortunately, the college admissions system isn't something reliable enough to recognize the things you guys can do or how amazing of human beings you people are. Sometimes, life deals us a decent hand (and to those of you who got what you wanted, I couldn't be happier for you), but other times it doesn't. And honestly, as terrible as it may seem, that's ok. No matter how uncertain the future is right now, I promise things will work out. Amazing things can spring out of unexpected situations. Maybe you'll meet lifelong friends who you couldn't live without, maybe you'll receive a job opportunity you never thought you would, maybe you'll find someone you'll eventually marry (if that's something you want in your life), or maybe you'll just finally have a chance to relax and be happy. And even if nothing presents itself, that's ok. The next opportunity is right around the corner.
it‚Äôs fine i‚Äôll just be mediocre for the rest of my life
I'm sorry, emi
I know
Or vent
i hate everything!!!! so much!!!!!
But it sounds like you want to talk it out
And that‚Äôs fine
Rip
i will Cry
Bc that is a lotta emotion for this chat
Do you want to chat on vc
_AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA_
i don‚Äôt care anymore what‚Äôs the point i‚Äôm not gonna try!!!!!
the universe wins!!!!!!
Do you wanna talk about it? We're here for you
i give up!!!!!
no!!!!!!!!!!
Emi you ok?
Damn
fuck college!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!
Is everything alright?
nothing is worth it anymore!!!!!!!!!
i‚Äôm gonna CombUsT
i lost 14 years from stress for this???????
Emi, you're where you are and the wonderful person you are today because you worked so hard
i could‚Äôve lived a whole ass life!!!!!!!
just to go to uw!!!!!
why did i try so hard!!!!!!
i hate my life!!!!!!
:/
If makes you feel any better tho, we can all bool together at UW. I'll probably be there
Once you're in, you really deserve to go. I'm sorry.
College tuition is the absolute worth
Yike
i might have to go to uw which is incredibly devastating to me
i‚Äôm so disappointed that i can‚Äôt afford to go to uci
honestly
Thanks Helen
Lol alright
Usually yes
Just to clarify, ‚Äúgeneral electives‚Äù just means shit that isn‚Äôt on the required list of classes for the program right?
We're here for you if you need us
Everything alright?
Yike
help
this is me now
I am sorry to everyone I made fun of for checking portals obsessively back when like UW was coming out n shit
Colleges: *taps forehead* can't take the credits if we don't take the student
Northeastern takes 5/6/7 in IB but 4/5 in ap
Point being: duke only takes 6/7 in IB but 3/4/5 in ap
Just figure their IB and ap shit out
I wish colleges could like
You know
F im sorry
oof!
lmao but i will try to recover
tok rn is the definition of "things going wrong"
i mean, for your own sake and work ethic, try in your classes. don't get me wrong. just don't stress about it as much when things don't go wrong.
i know warnings don't mean much but it feels like a close shave
cuz you're not getting any more grades. the next set of grades you get is when you're actually in college, so they have nothing to hold against you unless you start flunking freshman year.
my brother got a warning from UMich, and he never even got a response cuz that's how little they cared
you basically just have to tell them "oh yeah, [somewhat valid excuse such as IB exams] got in the way and my grades suffered as a result, so i'll be sure to work harder on ensuring my successes in classes in the future to balance my life better" or something, and they say "k"
i told them that they'd get a warning, but warning's aren't a huge deal
you'll get a warning and that's scary as fuck lmao
but most won't rescind for a C if you have an otherwise good gpa
i know the UCs have a very clear rule about 3.0 and above
it also depends on the college
at least that's what i told my friend the other day when they were worried about a C they had getting them rescinded from UW
also, they only rescind over multiple Cs, right? usually 1 is fine to my understanding
i saw "you won't believe" as a notification and got concerned that you got hacked and were sending clickbait
you won't believe how relieved i am to find out that colleges only rescind for below 3.0 gpa or C's and below
LOL
wHAt dOeS CaLCuLuS hAVe tO DO wItH StATiStIcS
that's cool i guess
hm, interesting
This was part of our hw lol
damn, no wonder my grade in this class is hot shit
Stats
really?
Yeah
But like
Well not confidence intervals
Omg hl2 is doing this math rn
Hahahaha
this is what our parents think college apps are like
good luck cindy!
good luck!
hopefully soon!
WHEN WILL I KNOW
I genuinely don't really care, I'm just still anxious about canada
im sorry
F
Officially rejected from gtown ‚úå
Don't want to do too much EE tho so I'm not majoring in ECE
But ECE is in Pratt and you have to be in Pratt if you double major in the two
Need to be in Trinity arts and sciences for CS
is compsci in sciences
Pratt school of Engineering
what'd you apply for lol
nice!
I'm prolly going to major CS and minor electrical & comp engineering
...after I figure out my messed up schedule lol
I'm going to commit
Yeah
duke?
which school
It's happened to a couple of other ppl tho so hopefully it will be a smooth transfer
I dun goofed and applied to the wrong college so I'm trying to transfer before matriculating lmao
The exp and connections would be esp important where I‚Äôm headed
But yeah I agree
the combined major i want to do might not fit well with doing 2
here's the thing tho
professional exp and connections are way more valuable than extra classes
<@!340319804747415553> if you're looking at NU I highly recommend doing more than 1 co-op
yay!
i think i will
i appreciate the sentiment
thanks
i hope you find it
whatever your definition of success is
well
also success is subjective lol
either way i want to be a complete and utter monster when i graduate muahaha
good luck! it'll be exciting to see what you'll do. you're gonna be super successful
but i def want the double major
and i could drop the minor
hopefully it's a good kind of busy
well
damn, you sound like you're gonna be busy
i've been trying to plan a combined major + minor schedule + 1 co-op instead lol
thanks for your help
i'll just see what happens then
not familiar with the waitlist stuff
idk, fam
idk dude
uh
oh sweet. apparently NYU waitlists you for your top choice. this is actually p nice.
so if i wanna visit the college, i should prolly go before they accept me off the waitlist, right?
respond asap
yes
with waitlists, they expect a p quick turnaround, right?
laughs in vanderbilt
dab on 'em
you can also rescind your spot after you've accepted lol
if it is what i think it is
i mean, i'm prolly gonna accept my spot on it
yeet
you can also refuse your spot on the waitlist
you can back out
does anyone at least know if waitlists are binding, or can i back out?
i'd have to reapply for the major
this one won't really
i know that most private univs will let you switch majors p easily
honestly, idk?
hey, so if i'm waitlisted at a school, how do i know what major they'll give me if i'm selected? i don't wanna put myself on a waitlist and steal someone else's spot if they're just gonna admit me in something i'm not keen on studying
I was joking
Play Tales of, it's my favorite JRPG
Yeah
That's a butt ton of work still
It's Final Fantasy
Maybe just the lore part
It's a huge-ass AAA game
That would be one miserable poorly paid intern if they made all of Final Fantasy X
Maybe it was done by some poorly paid intern
Apparently my brother liked it
Haven‚Äôt played it but I‚Äôve looked into the ff lore
The lore is badly written/a bit all over the place
Ff10 was a disappoint lol
It's just Final Fantasy X idk lmao
When she's super old she'll find it and it will be worth like a bajillion dollars
Damn that‚Äôs a mood
Also, she apparently still don't know where her copy of the game is to this day
You would get along with her
Amazing
That‚Äôs
Dude I wanna meet her now
Hahahaha
So
She apparently threw her copy of Final Fantasy X out a literal window 30 minutes in after being disappointed with it
Damn
Suddenly I don't want to date anymore
Courtney was already an avid gamer
Also, you have to force your SO to watch SpongeBob
So that means someone is going to force me to become an avid gamer
Lol
Yes-ish
Oh damn
Is that what actually happened
Iconic
Hahahahaha
You have to teach your SO Magic: The Gathering and get them so hooked on it that they don't wanna leave you
Lol I can‚Äôt brain
Brb finding me a sugar daddy in college ;)
I mean, if you want my brother's path as reference
Lol rip
Okok I still have hope
My reasoning was if he dated in high school then married his college gf, that means I can't marry my college bf because I never dated in high school
I was like in kindergarten at the time so idk
My hunch is no
Idk I think so? I don't know the details, but if that was dating, it was prolly cringe
<@258094439636008971> do you know if he dated in high school?
True. They're p perfect for each other, so I suppose as long as it works out
I never specified time frame
That's not a counterpoint
Okay fair
Counterpoint: they dated for like 7-8 years before getting married
Hahahahaha
<@233062637922025472> that means you can also marry your UMich gf
Yep
Lol I think so
Didn't he also marry his college girlfriend? üëÄ
Ah the rubics cube
<@460689096646590465> also, nice job sliding into those dms
Also, beautiful campus, world's largest  Rubik's cube, and apparently you can order food 24/7 from this one thing
He's still friends with a lot of his college friends to this day, so have fun meeting some awesome people
I could ask him stuff for you or hell maybe even arrange a meeting. <@233062637922025472>
If you want someone to talk to, my brother went there.
<@233062637922025472> Congrats! I'm so happy for you! You're gonna love it there.
Hahaha emi you legend
Grats Jiayi!
And one of his friends but I'm not sure who it was
I know that Ansen is also going!
CONGRATS JIAYI
<@!258094439636008971> also cute uci dude and i started talking over dms about uci :3
i haven‚Äôt heard
HEY CONGRATS!!!!
Do you guys know anybody else going to UMich? I feel like I haven't heard or seen anybody talking about going there at all
Alright I've made the decision to go to UMich College of Engineering!
The real reason to go to college
hey hey hey remember the cute uc irvine vlogger boy
Rip
but still a usc
not the same usc
we weren‚Äôt kidding when we said the USC area was sketch
wow that's pretty cool actually
no one asked but uc irvine has a whole ass course on korean entertainment (k dramas, kpop, etc) vs hollywood AND they have a game design major
*we legalized weed first*
ahem
No shade but like it's the truth
Oregon is wannabe Washington tbh
everything about it is like living in washington but with more trees
guys...reed is so oregon
Also represents win + lose
oh
waitlist
what's a WL
what a fun time
i went 3:8:1 lol
<@258094439636008971> I had the exact same ratio as you, 6:9:3
:(((((((((
:(
aw emi
But hopefully one of the other schools opens up some unexpected happy paths for you. You're still a wonderful friend and a terrific human being, and you'll be able to find success wherever you go.
I'm sorry it didn't work out the way you hoped
Those schools are the dumb butts. You'd be a great student at any school and deserve the world.
i have all these schools that value me and want me and send me a bunch of shit in the mail and yet the only places i want to go to are the schools that don‚Äôt want me
Awww, I'm sorry, guys
i don't wanna go to school period :p
lol
i suddenly don‚Äôt want to go to any of my schools
Sometimes, ya just pull the short end of the stick, but it'll work out in the end.
Lowkey kinda wishing applied to more cuz just 1 out-of-state acceptance would have made me feel way better about myself
Went 2-3-1 (W-L-WL)
I applied for 6
and gor into 2
i applied for 13
hmmm
me, after applying to 17 schools and getting into 10: i should‚Äôve applied to more schools
Alexa is a true friend
lol
alexa play breaking my heart
This machine is a better human being than most other people will ever be
Well
Shit
RIP
sorry to break your heart but it was a machine
WSU AOs are Tru bros

well, guess where i'll be headed then, y'all
WSU wished me happy birthday and Stanford gave me a rejecc
WSU > Stanford
woooooo stanford reject gang ü§ô
F
Mood Jiayi
Still waiting on stanford and cmu
I got rejected from everything yesterday
I am in full support
Lmao
acceptance rate: anyone except people who associate with berkeley
f l e x
Bigger flex: open up EmiU and compete with Berkeley for years to come
honestly i just want to become a billionaire and donate a shit ton of money to stanford while glaring down at berkeley with purpose
Y'all gonna be successful, and a couple dumb-ass AOs can't change shit about thay
You guys are wonderful human beings and super intelligent individuals
Hey, no
its fine either way i'll end up in a cardboard box on the street begging for change
Awww, I'm sorry, guys
sorry duke you already took my family's money once... there's no more left lol
sorry uc im broke
It's not y'alls' fault you guys didn't have several hundred thousand dollars to drop on bribing someone
Oof

pop goes the weasel?
higher education is a bubble anyway

Yikes, I'm sorry, Salina
Awww, I'm sorry, emi

it took me 6.5 hours to actually stop crying
mood
everything feels turgid in my eye sockets
its great
Are you doing alright?
my eyeballs feel like grapes
:‚Äô) ‚ù§
Just keep being you and who you strive to be. Berkeley's the one who's missing on Emily Tang. You're a wonderful human being, and that this is in no way a valuation of who you are.
maybe i need to try less hard
Aww, I'm sorry, Emi
berkeley: is there anything you‚Äôd like us to know?
me: i tried Really Hard
Well, I believe you do. We're proud of you. No matter what happens, you're a wonderful person, and none of that's changed.
But that‚Äôs okay
No I don‚Äôt
No
Aww, I'm sorry. Take care, Salina. I hope things start looking up soon. You deserve the world.
As much as I don‚Äôt want to feel rekt by this all, I do feel rekt
I‚Äôm just gonna stay off chat for a bit tbh
I wish I‚Äôd gotten duke but it‚Äôs all good haha
I'm proud of all y'all. Y'all deserve the world.
Proud of you <3

rip
kinda wish I did now but I did not
no
Did you apply?
nyu is out
Yoooo Berkeley's out at 3
7 years seems a bit too long of a vendetta
why not
are we preparing for a 7-year revolution against the ivy league?
that was the point
this is what i envisioned
lol
the ivies are coming
bye
cya
yeah
slightly lessen the headache
anyway we should both continue to do work lmao
close enough
we're both referencing the same thing in 1984
is reference tyler's reference of 1984
what you gotta do
no, no
mine also makes a 1984 reference
it's a good book
was good tho
he referenced 1984 again
*today
his FOA was tody
yee
tylenol rhymes with tyler gall
oof same
where is the tylenol
i should skidaddle and do my stats hw
headache incoming
yeet
y i k e
which is in approx 9 hrs
gotta get through my FOA first tho
yeee
ivy day is here
ivy time is 4 pm today
or should i say
destiny still arrives
run from it
dread it
30 seconds
it's almost here
F lmao
i care the least about UCB so i'm fine with checking that later
idk if i trust NYU to have solid servers
lmao
good point
ah true
UCB will def crash tho lol
cuz then students will be split between checking each
i think the servers will be fine
i mean
y i k e
but yeeeee time to crash all the servers
better than staggered tbh
all at once
then Stanford on Fri and CMU on Sat
are the ivies all at once or staggered?
F
yeah i'm getting like 5 ivys + UCB  + Duke
im actually only getting two decisions tomorrow, but everyone else seems like they're getting 8
i can't fathom getting into any of them
which means i get into a school
but if it isn't bad that means it's good
who knows maybe it won't go badly
tomorrow is in 6 minutes
and sat prob
and friday
i ded tomorrow
im sorry
rip
but lmao
well waitlist
Rip I'm sorry
Confused about what defer means for reg apps tho
Aww, I'm sorry
and I'm sorry üò¶
do schools defer for normal apps
waitlist? or defer
Laughs in Vanderbilt defer
Thank you. I don't know if it is, but I'm gonna try to keep that door open.
if it's the best course of action for you, you can do it
there def have been ib diploma students who went to BC
it's a battle royale but for your education and future
isn't everyone engineering undeclared
also engineering cutthroat af apparently
i was just telling cindy about how engineering undeclared was not exactly safe haven i thought it was and have just as likely of a chance to get a major i want
bc idr
did you get a major at uw or like... no?
my family would not be happy with it and my insecurities would go through the roof, but it's probably a better play for my mental health than going to uw once i'm able to look past sunk cost fallacy
eh
that's kinda why i'm hoping to avoid it
there's nothing wrong with going to a community college tbh
the other route can be worse
i'm just saying
oh, i was asking about bc
uw
wait, at uw or bc?
shit
but like they didn't get the major they wanted and then got hella burnt out and depressed
last thing i need is more uw horror stories
no
also, yike
<@!340319804747415553> after transferring from bc?
about?
i have uw horror stories of people who ended up unhappy as hell
if you want precedent
i mean
if you want to save money, there is no reason you shouldn't go to a community college for the first two years
true, but i'm just curious if we have precedent of it
is prob yourself
the main stigma tbh
tbh that'd prob be fine
do any skyline ib dip students ever go to bc or another community college after graduation, or does stigma hold them back?
ok, one more thing for reference
but ya thanks
i mean same
no problem, hope it works out
ha I have trouble being honest about myself with people I AM close to
thank you
ill see. i have trouble being honest about myself with people i'm not that close to tho
you can also fill out a slip to ask for a session w the mental health counselor
counseling office
also, i'm not really actually that close to my counselor, so i might look for something else lmao
to my teacher or to the counseling office?
and say like hey I'm not doing great can I talk to my person
even during a class
you can just drop in
thanks for understanding. i'll prolly just try to talk to my counselor tomorrow or make plans to resolve my systematic mental health issues once i'm 18 so i'm better equipped for this
a pain in the ass
college is just
nah it's fine
sorry to complain. i know a lot of y'all have your own set of problems, and i know a lot of people would kill to be in the situation i'm in. i'm just struggling to make peace with my situation despite the fact i ended up exactly where i didn't want to be completely by accident, but that's how life be.
idk, fam. i was supposed to be studying something i love and have it be a challenge i was willing to through with cuz i actually wanted to pursue it on top of my independence. now i'm looking at, "well, that future is spiraling into uncertainty, so you might end up somewhere or doing something you hate while working twice as hard as you normally do, but hey, less people will notice when you mysteriously leave for three hours to cry outside"
for me, it doesn't outweigh the cons
that means a lot to some people. and while i do appreciate the fact i'll have that and look forward to it, i know it means more to others than it will to me
i respect that
maybe I'm overly optimistic then, but honestly, independence is gonna make me inherently way happier than I am now
*depending on your major
depends
^
uh 3rd and 4th year will be rough
i want the grind to stop lmao
That gives you the year of recovery you wanted
only cuz "you're used to the grind"
not just freshman year lmao
*freshman year of college
To be fair a lot of people from skyline have said that college is easier than IB diploma
eh
different flavors of that depending on the school but like
IB's too demanding? Have fun at this college/program known for beating the pulp out of you.
You don't sleep enough at night? Yeah, try doing that while struggling with these college classes.
You're uncertain about your future? Boi, wait til I tell you we're not letting you into that major you wanted.
You have a fear of disappointing others and yourself? College is expensive, but you're walking out with a useless degree.
You hate the majority of the content you're studying? How about we make that the only content you get to study so you can actually not die after college in theory.
how come?
in most places i look, i see more of the same but with some of my current problems exacerbated and the loss of the majority of my coping mechanisms
cost and employment potential are the main metrics I'm going by
in all honesty I think I could be happy pretty much anywhere in college as long as it's away from here
not that trying to find a job afterwards sounds any more fun ayyy
at the end of the day, college is still just school, and the reason we're so picky with where we wanna go is because we foresee very few outcomes where we're happy to be at school
i might as well just have a year where i can say, "fuck it"
but if college is gonna be miserable for me no matter what
i mean, there's that
to each their own but I wanna get out of high school hell as soon as possible
eh fair
that sounds kinda awful
tbh, not really
does anyone want an extra year of high school where we can just take a bunch of bs classes with no stakes? like a gap year but like it's actually built into the education system as a norm and isn't hella expensive
yeah, they should have a say if they've been helping you through this process or they're paying pull tuition, but if they're just butting in and thinking they can control your decisions without their advice being asked for, that's on them for not actually being a positive force earlier
we've agreed they're not gonna pay full tuition, that's about it
so like, all things considered, I get p salty when they try to dictate anything I'm doing
wait wtf
yo what lmao
my dad actually refused to help me w financial aid and scholarship apps so I figured out his password and dug their tax forms out of his computer myself lmao
they gave me 0 help during the application process and I was fine w that
they really don't give a shit about my college choices except when it's convenient for them to butt in
so much respect
damn respect
I kinda just calmly told them that I've considered that already and to fuck off
lmao
and this is coming from a family where all of us are canadian citizens and are well aware of the extreme benefits
*cue white guy blinking gif*
"no one in the US has heard of the university of toronto wtf is that"
that's what happened
honestly
dude
lol the other day my parents had a freakout and were like "omg if you go to canada all your connections will be canadian and you won't ever be able to move back to the US!!!!"
but yeah still big rip
it wasnt a huge deal cuz i wasnt particularly interested
rip!
my parents shat on non-US school not in britain when i mentioned that i could consider them because they don't really give them half as much credit as they deserve
it's really fuckin expensive obviously but I'd be able to afford it if tuition is so much less
housing in vancouver/toronto is helllllla nice
highkey also one of the reasons I wanna go to canada
single bathroom is v valid!!
Hahaha bathroom
which goes to show that my priorities are definitely not straight, and i can tell that
if i got into NYU, i could have my own bathroom tho if i pick the right dorms, and that in itself is more of a reason i want to go than i'd like to admit
2 on thurs, 1 on fri
stanford (would prolly be miserable cuz i'm not good enough to succeed here), upenn (less miserable but future/major would be uncertain), and NYU (parents would be less supportive/post-college uncertainty due to niche major and complexities in double-majoring)
I feel. that's a p fat L. best of luck my dude, what schools are you still waiting on?
Yikes
oof
i'd be lying if i said i haven't been miserable the past couple of years in IB and am primarily looking for something won't make me miserable in the future
i've honestly had some consideration of going to BC to try to apply again next year to some schools that won't try to steal my soul, but i feel like that'd be a similar problem but amplified
apparently some of this is new info and UW engineering advisors have been kinda shady regarding this so beware @people considering UW engineering
they claim to support whatever i want to do, but they've also made it clear (ironically both implicitly and explicitly) that this isn't the case. they're not married to me going to UW, but that's what they're both expecting. my dad's actually tried to talk me through my concerns like a normal person (granted, with faulty reasoning due to misunderstandings of the situation, but the intent was p wholesome) and my mom just started yelling at me to get homework done while i was having a crisis
Do your parents really want you to go there?
Damn
i know there's not much i can do about it, but my mom started getting pissed about me being frustrated and insisted that it was a bridge for me to cross when i got there, but usually if this doesn't work out for people (which it prolly won't for me cuz i only want one of the more popular majors and would perish in the others due to the skills involved), they just transfer out of UW after two years of hell
it's fine. i always knew UW was gonna be a little cutthroat, but i was thinking, "eh, it can't be that bad" and then i saw this and had absolutely no faith in it. this kind of situation feels like the exact thing i was trying to get away from this whole time
I'm sorry :(
Rip
or a reddit comment that sums it up:
source: https://www.engr.washington.edu/current/placement
I know UW sucks with majors, it's literally a system that sets people up to fail, but how bad is it within that specifically
What's up with engineering
Oooof
Lmao I just found out about a policy that makes UW engineering a way shittier option than it should be, so I'm having a sad boi hours over that, and that somehow escalated into an argument with my parents. Something that used to be one of my top choices is now something I'm honestly kinda scared to attend.
I'm sorry, but I know all of you are gonna do fantastic things anyway
y'all are fantastic people
aw guys
l m f a o
Rice acceptance rate record low 8.7% this year...
lol we'll see
hopefully vandy pulls through
good luck
uhm
yikeroni
i love having 3 consecutive days of depresso in the middle of the week
looks like i've got vanderbilt tomorrow
also
lol
have fun?
well
Ls
a good way to murder your sanity further
more than an hour of soloqueue ow as a support is uh
yeah
only an hour?
for like an hour
avoid my problems
that's why i'm gonna just
that's a mood
Idk about y'all, but this process is making me start to lowkey dread going to college
yup
Damn, we've all been taking major Ls together in this Discord
I'm sorry
that's a mood
L
Time to stress eat
I'm just sad
Do you wanna talk about it?
Aww, I'm sorry, Jeesoo
aw D:
I'm taking this badly
It's like unrequited love
Loved that
lol
Actually nvm, that'd be a massive waste of food
Get a bag of rice and just
Can we all just like
we can be sad together
welcome to the party
we both got rekt huh
alas indeed
Alas
I REALLY REALLY REALLY wanted to go there
Rice
lol rip
Hahahah
and which school do i need to angrily call
que paso
damn jeesoo
My dream school just shat on me
Ay.
It's all a crapshoot
it's not a perfect system, their is a lot of just pure chance involved
i.e, you did nothing wrong and you didn't get the result you wanted
Fam, you worked so hard to get to this point. No matter what route you took, it can't be said that you weren't at least doing that. Sure, some things may have been imperfect, but that doesn't invalidate your other accomplishments. Don't let the "could've, should've, would'ves" get you hung up in your own head. You're already so much and are soon off to be so much more. No matter what anyone says, be it your parents, colleges, or even yourself, remember that we're proud of you, and you deserve to be proud of yourself too.
i am so ready to just be a puddle
goddamn i really need it to be spring break
and it's just kinda fucking with me some more
which i have some degree of ctrl over
it basically comes down to essays, extracurriculars, and rec letters
my grades aren't the issue and neither are test scores prob
Wait, what? Why??
like my parents are just looking over me and being like wtf dude you kinda blew it for yourself
I feel you there
True
Northeastern seems p lit! Co-op heaven.
i wish i felt more confident in having options, but the walls feel like they're closing in
and i don't have any qualms about it for most part
but anyway, northeastern is prob where i'm headed at this rate
Yikeroni
also that's the day of my tok pres lol
i am so getting my ass fucking rejected by everything
thursday is literally gonna be a crapshoot
And if not, we can all get together sometime to get it off your mind
hahaha
I mean, hopefully things start looking up soon
Aww, I'm sorry
and that's fine
i'm just kind of in my head
.... mostly
i'm doing mostly fine with this admissions process
but anyway
lol
Me neither
i wasn't at school today
yeah ik
Get some rest if you can
lol
Yike
been nursing a bad headache all day
incredibly sick
i am
me?
<@340319804747415553> you doing alright tho?
I'm doing better now and just praying NYU pulls through
But that's ok
Cuz there's a huge chance I don't get into a major I want after toiling away in what sounds like a p toxic competitive environment
I went from being p excited to go to absolutely dreading it
I started looking into UW a bit more closely, and it terrifies me now
por quoi?
damn
Been a little less ok with it today
you doing ok dude?
rip
I'm just roasting USC as a coping mechanism
True
except usc got put on fucking blast by the scandal
tbf a lot of ivies have the same issue as usc
L
USC's a bit of an exception. No college is worth $500k for admission.
i kinda expected it after usc
it's fine
eh
lmao
Oof I'm sorry
Like getting bread instead
Go obtain some real grain
well i was hoping to be finalist in the rice-baylor med program
Rice ain't actually nice
cuz this rice thing ain't working out lol
Get that bread
well looks like i should invest in wheat then
prob lol
Probably more like 8-10%
But I mean, it's Rice, so I expect it to have a high yield rate
prob around the 12-16% mark then
Yeah
Cuz yield
that's fair
Number of spaces isn't the number of accepted students
Oh, it's probably a little more than 4%
plus they're close to the tx medical center which makes them really good for med/bio/chem
they have really small class sizes
B o i  w h a t
wait damn is the rice acceptance rate really 4% lol
Ya never know
All sub-20% acceptance rates are crapshoots
yeah well i couldn't hit usc or rice, which are a notch down from ivies tbh
One school does not predict another
Besides, who needs Rice when you can go out and get some bread?
at this rate... lol
Hopefully it works out tho
well this really makes me optimistic for ivy day lmao
The dumb butts don't deserve you
Aww, I'm sorry
lol the reject swings around once more haha
Good luck!!!
*lmao
Maybe I'll open them in a group call lmwo
i'm just gonna open it asap
damn look at u
I think I'm going to save all my decisions until March 30 to open
Good luck!
yike rice is out in 7
I don't give a shit tho NU is better
oh since I'm in this channel now, today I got rejected from Boston U
which is just as good
maybe someone else will find it insulting
just felt like announcing that
no one else is gonna think it's funny so no I'm good
I also clicked on the wrong channel oops
say it
oh god I just cracked myself up w an incredibly offensive and inappropriate thought
Lol
if i had it, it wouldn't be going towards bribing someone at USC
I wish I had that kind of money haha
Lol
o no
Rip my hidden 750k :p
Lmfao
now we know for sure that none of us are bribing cheaters
Jk love you all
Groups that sad together stay together
Can I say that I love that our group‚Äôs usc record is flawless :p
Tbh
good luck to all of you too ‚ù§
we'll see
and northeastern w scholarship is a better choice than p much any other american schools I applied to
I figure gtown is a lost cause and I'm poor anyways
thanks
good luck!
I just got back from their visit to seattle actually
the only one I'm still kinda scared about is ubc bc I would actually love to go
honestly LA is cool but I don't really care that much
remember: USC's school of cinematic arts rejected steven spielberg 3 different times and eventually started having to name shit after him. they have a history of overlooking talent
first reject! usc
I got into ucla but no major, whatever, they don't have undergrad for what i wanna do anyways so I have no idea why I applied
also lol hello I just checked
^^^
salina, gon' be honest, you're one of the smartest and hardest-working individuals i've ever met. a few admission officers who struggle to read shit at 1AM can't change anything about that. it's less about the school you go to and more about what you're gonna do with it. and even then, admission officers are humans who overlook talent. someone else is gon' see something in that sheet a paper, and they're gonna be one of the luckiest people on the planet some years from now
You should he grad speaker
Wise words
It's why you apply to multiple of the same caliber
^
One college can't predict another
my essays for duke were kinda weak
if usc handed me the L, duke isn't gonna take me
it's aight, salina. they def missing out. there's another business school out there that'll take you further
Continue the legacy
lol i doubt it
Sal is going to Duke tho
i really wanted to get into their business school and take the premed minor
ngl i'm a lil sad about usc too lol
love y'all too
They will wish you donate $50000 to get your kids in 
But you can flex on them because you'd never need to do that
And we can dance our worries away
I'll see you at siv
We love you gene
thank, guys. y'all are the best
lmao
Just buy the whole campus with 1/38s of your extra spending money when you succeed at age 26
go gene
Kill em gene
You go Gene
gon' be honest, at face value, i don't stand out on a sheet of paper cuz i spent most of high school not giving two shits about my extracurriculars lol. i wouldn't really change much about what i did (aside from starting my app way earlier), so i'm relatively at peace. gon' make USC grovel at my feet when i apply as a transfer or for a master's
rip
`Be Boundless‚Ñ¢, within the bounds`
can confirm, am mariners fan
the dubs are nothing without the Ls, fam
Imma be a boundless boi
You can be a Boundless Boi‚Ñ¢ with me ü§†
Good choice geneo
YES
yes i am
looking into double-majoring human-centered design and engineering and interaction design, but idk
Are you coming to siv? I forgot if you answered or not
Dream big gene wang
You, but I guess anyone it can apply to
<@!271149039020408843> sakurai is a god idk
prob u
<@!472541429130854421> who are you asking?
Cya
You're the future sakurai and USC missed a gem
jk
I'll see yall in a bit I'm gonna drive now
vegetate
What do you want to do at UW?
jeesoo, you're a wonderful human being
It's almost over!!!
awww, thank you so much
And I couldnt be more proud of you right now
yeah, i know. i've come to terms with that
You're the same person before and after that decision
thanks. love y'all too
Idc bout em
I applied to five ivys and five others left to go
We all love you
I didn't apply to ivies
Aww. Gene
I haven't even made accounts on most portals
ivy day is thursday
W: WSU, UW
L: USC
pending: NYU, Stanford, UPenn
Dude I literally have no idea when things come out
yike ivy day sounds scary for you
MIT, Caltech, Georgia tech, ucla
brown, duke, princeton, rice, vanderbilt, UPenn
i‚Äôm kinda bitter bc like they accepted a bunch of my friends and it‚Äôs like h im just as good as them but whatever
apply for WSU 10 times to get 10 Ws
Oh wait I'm 4-4
Lol I have the most rejections so far
next week is gonna be such an L tho
ahahahhahaha
I really don't give a shit about it tho
i'm 3-2 now
i'm not 3-1
im probably just gonna end up UW tbh
wait
Oh I forgot to check ucla
i‚Äôm putting it up on the wall
ucla broke my streak 9-1
i think this is a good rejecc letter to put up on the wall
If Salina didn't get in my chances are like 0.0000000000001
*salt*
they certainly weren't in mineeee
may the odds be ever in your favor
good luck!!
I'll be back before 4:30 but yea
rip
I'm walking back to my car rn lmao
yike
Idk if ucsd even counts
I'm not home and my phone is lowkey dying
I'm at 4-3
i would check <@!503787499605458954>
i'm 3-1 now
Oh wow nice!
rip
i'm 2-1
I haven't checked yet but I'm currently 6-0 on acceptances and I feel like this is the end of my streak
It's super competitive because they took in too many people from bribes to leave space for smart people
Oh damn
lmfao
i thought i'd get in but uh
kuddos to them but like damn i'm smart not a genius
it really does
USC looks super competitive this year
honestly, looking online right now
go to a college who wants you
northeastern looks more enticing by the minute
r i p
lol
nah, i'll just git gud and then pay 500k to transfer in
damn wtf does usc want from me lmao
You don't want to be classmates with people whose parents bribed their way in anyway
we can make mildly passive aggressive jokes about usc tonight
i stress ate my way through ucla yesterday
it's not unexpected lol
come and have some cake
it's aight. thanks
rip sorry gene
Come have fun tonight and blow some steam
i‚Äôm sorry gene
i'm handling it decently
it's cool
Aw I'm sorry guys
*high fives*
i got rejected lmfao
damn
There are some rumors floating around the internet that it's just international applicants, but I got rejected, so I imagine it's all rejections.
To anyone else who applied to USC, I would check your portal. If you haven't heard anything yet, you might be in. It looks like they're updating rejections first.
Just know it's all gonna work out. Some school out there's gonna get lucky in a month when you commit to them. I don't know which school that is, but it will be the right one for you and welcome you with open arms. You're a wonderful person and where you go to school next year doesn't change that.
I'm sorry
i don‚Äôt know what i want anymore
Good to hear you're finding a healthy outlet then
i put my sad energy into hot yoga this morning
Awww I'm sorry, emi. You doing alright?
high key still hurt by ucla
i also got rejected from ucla but i got into ucsd for english literature üòÑ
||***gene this was sarcasm***||
of becoming the Triton I always wanted to be
Fam, we support you all the way!! Go Alan!
anyways I hope you'll all support me in my endeavor
But what is that
Idk what that is either
idk I just looked up whatever their mascot was
What that
Triton?
...?
...
I've always wanted to be a
it's my dream school to go so I'm really happy rn
My results are the exact same
thanks I really appreciate it
Oh, congrats!
UC San Diego: ‚úÖ: Major undeclared
What's that mean
UCLA: üáΩ
Can someone join me in making $500k bribes jokes tomorrow after USC notifies me?
I'm saying for the future
They're not going to buy better servers just for one moment
This happens every year with app deadlines too
Nah, they just need better servers
jesus
110000+ applicants
They should do the release in waves thing
That's how it be sometimes
H
IT CRASH
Lmaoooo
It's a crash, so it might take a while
That might be me being kinda reactionary tho
Hot take: it's impolite to directly ask/talk about a specific college's admission decisions, and if people wanna know, they should ask about the college process in general (unless the whole thing's been a fat L)
Thank you for checking though
rip
I'm doing better, but I'm still recovering from the shock
It's fine. They're kinda disconnected and they mean, well, so I respect
doing better now or no?
sorry to hear that dude
damn
Tonight set off some false alarms, and I had a breakdown and argument with my parents over it
my parents "don't care" about me going to college but are still making snippy comments about doing compsci
it's actually useful to her
my mom is in a nationwide parents college chat with other chinese parents
But like I'm actually considering calling my family friend right now and telling them to stop
my parents literally don‚Äôt care anymore
the underground railroad
wechat
i trust nobody but my own inbox
wenxuecity
<@460689096646590465> online threads
I get the good intentions
we all thought UCSD was out last friday so when i came home and didn't say anything about it my mom was like "...do you have any...good news to share?"
i don't appreciate the narcissistic nature of parenting culture, but here we are
how do people get this information
I feel like I should be the first person to know and like I've been responsible throughout this entire process
I don't appreciate false alarms
lmaooo
L
she's becoming one w the Adults
that just shipped yesterday
dude my sister just barged into my room to ask if I got into american
^^
welcome to chinese mom culture
The past two hours for me have been rollar coaster
My mom: Yo, I heard USC decisions are out
Me: wtf that's not supposed to happen yet
My mom: Well, I heard from [family friend] that somebody's already in
Me: *panics and checks portal, Reddit, literally everything for half an hour*
Reddit: lol, they shipped out packages today. Literally two people have received them so far
Me: why would yo‚Äî
My mom: I just heard from [family friend] that NYU is out
Me: wtf they literally said they weren't updating for a week
My mom: again, apparently they know someone who got in
Computer: *crashes*
Me: *big anxiety and stress*
Portal: *is an empty bitch*
Reddit: fam, a couple people got huge-ass need-based scholarships got emails wait a week lol
Me: Where the fuck does [family friend] get their sources, and how are they checking college portals and Reddit more frequently than me, and and why the fuck does my mom think this means someone in Skyline
im also hearing portals update on the 23rd (saturday) at 5PM
yeah
so i expect we get something on saturday in the mail
L
they got mailed today apparently
ah oof
thank you!
fam, why dont you just update your portal before shipping out hard copies : ' )
Good luck!!!
oh shit usc decisions are starting to come out. some socal people already have packages shipped
Oof I'm sorry. Best of luck tho! I hope it works out for us. We'll all get through this together. Plenty of chances yet to come.
Same gene I havent gotten a single acceptance from a non-safety school so far
Thanks. Hopefully it all works out.
but best of luck
not really
tbh
Anyone else having the same thing?
I'm lowkey starting to get super anxious about decisions. I might wanna transfer depending on where I get in and where I don't, so idk how much my grades right now matter lol.
I mean, Skyline is p well off compared to most high schools with admissions
and it makes skyline feel better about not being a magnet school
it's supposed to be a positive message
why would they not be?
I'm surprised Skyline's ok with this
Same
i've never seen it before this year
<@472541429130854421> do they normally do a rejection wall?
Mine's here
Me, yesterday
Mine arrived yesterday
Yea
Has anyone who got into UW actually gotten their acceptance package in the mail yet?
UCLA not out today
We getting this bread today?
yike
I'll get Sasha to Photoshop me doing crew too
ask your parents for their retirement money?
Rip
anyone have several million dollars i could use to scam my way into USC?
MIT is too stuck up to deserve any of us tbh
lol
that's too baaaaaaad
ohhhhh nooooooo
3:28 for us
Yee
For anyone who applied
MIT comes out today 6:28 pm eastern
i see you, thanos
^better to over-accept and then weed people out
Yeah so there's a delicate balance
or they're just burning money
sorry lol
harvest those high achieving bitches
but they also want to fill all the capacity they have
Colleges usually try to avoid over accepting too much so they can maintain high yield rate which increases rankings
so they do probably give out around 3 times more spots than they have
UW has a 33% acceptance rate
That's called yield rate
I mean they know a certain number won't accept
is my point
well state schools are always worse
In one lecture hall
UcB can get up to 2000
no no no
UW is an extreme case, class sizes can get up to 800
-_-
disagree
every school over admits to everything
oof sorry noah
lmao
okay that's fair
they overadmit for everything
i heard they also overadmit for engineering
Idk why
Uw acceptances have also been lower this year
cindy, did you hear back or still not checking?
rip
rip
Yeah northeastern
NU?
wait from where
Like 6 people I know from different schools got rejected goddamn
thanks all lol
Bruh you can do this
yeah
(are their decisions rolling out during this time period?)
Good luck!!
DO IT
o boi
do I wanna know
O:
uHHH
I just got an email from northeastern
oh fuck
then we can come back and give our younger selves the blueprints, wire the money transfer etc.to build UGene early
generally
oh no the acceptance rate is like 15-25%
I keep falling into that trap
That's a big difference lol
when we're 40 and UGene exists, we all get degrees there and learn to build a time travel machine
of the actual acceptance rate
Oh
so it's probably still ~50%
that's expected yield from applicants
oh wait I'm dumb
oh but i figured out a way
We're taking apps in advance
it has yet to exist though
lmaooo
Nah, apply to UGene
Should have applied to Trump U smh
aka the slightly worse version of gtown lmao
Ohhhhh
AU is American
but unusually low
not the worst
9.5%
Actually that's not the worst
total # of apps 18500
Jesus
expected class  size 1760
What's AU?
Ooooo nice
Hi
I'm in an AU admissions webinar rn lol
Some UCs are also the 28th I've heard
All I know is ivies is 28th and Stanford is most likely 29th, so everyone gonna pull a big sad going into the weekend that week
scared though
I have yet to be legitimately rejected
If anyone finds out about it tho, lemme know
ah
They're one of those "by April 1" schools
I don't expect there to be info yet
I was gonna check when it got closer
24/25th?
And uh
Ramya deserves it
gene do you know when usc comes out?
anyways
queen
I very strongly suspect she's already gotten into several top tier schools but doesn't wanna say anything
I'm happy for her though. I respect if she doesn't want to share yet.
which is v valid
don't bother asking, she won't answer
I heard Ramya got into Berkeley but idk if it's true and she's super private + has been dead w super high fever for like 4 days so idk how people would've found out
Hopefully y'all get into UCLA so you can learn from Jared Diamond
Some UCs I think
What's coming out this Friday?
who has got bois coming out this friday
It's alright guys they do not deserve you
something something yield protecc
people from our area tend to get rejected by gtech not just because OOS rates are low but also because washington ppl don't often go even when we get in
They don't deserve y'all anyways. You're too good for 'em.
Oof, I'm sorry, guys
L
also got rejected from gtech
I ALSO GOT REJECTED FROM GTECH HA
OMG SAME
gg
welp
congrats buddy
F
I GOT REJECTED BY CALTECH
I don't know much about the situation though
L
Oberlin, Grinnell, and Hamilton seem to be the schools in question
So just a heads up if you didn't hear already, apparently there was a security breach at a few schools regarding some of the applicants. Idk if any of y'all are affected or how serious it is, but apparently it's a thing people are talking about
yikes
i guess that makes sense?
but jokes aside
see: chocolate dildo
also, you're p good a material science stuff
na, I want to get a master in aero
i mean, if you wanna get a master's in mechanical engineering, that's a valid route
rip
while applying to my major
but it would just be burning time
there is a minor in material science at UW I could do
i'd be good but just not happy
i'd love to major in sleep
but like holy shit i think i'd be p miserable
I'd love to do bachelor in materials, master in mech and PhD in aero, but time is a thing
mostly to my parents
i'm so sorry
i don't want to do pure cs
lol
i would go med/bio/business/cs
if i had unlimited time/work
^^^ SAME
i couldn't do a pure CS major and not hate myself. i could see myself minoring in it
i've been looking into a few different things but yeah
I assumed you would have applied to CS with game design and all
really?
i really dont know yet
what are you planning to major in?
depends on some things
prolly, but idk yet
<@!258094439636008971> are you going for your masters?
delightful
i have 4 years to inevitably change my mind
let it fester longer
which is more than 2 years
^
to ruminate and regret
i have 4 years
what are you laughing about
well
you want to do med
ain't that fun
true
oof
so I have to reapply again to places in two years
also I'm going for my masters
well, i'm glad you have an option you're still chill with
i guess
plus campus and culture if you care about that
it's more networking and outside opportunities
does UW allow you to minor in mechanical engineering?
i suppose, yeah
regardless of school
any mech engineer can work with any other mech engineer
that's a valid option too
oh, i didnt realize you applied
I'll just go to WSU instead
oh
again, barring a transfer situation
if you really want to study engineering but can't at UW, paying more for tuition out of state is still the best deal for studying engineering on the table if the UW option isn't there
?
and while it costs more than the increase in education is, part of that premium you're paying is going towards having the ability to study engineering if UW is no longer an option
would have liked to
but still
it's much more what you make of yourself afterwards
and I know how much they make
Boeing has VPs from WSU
lol
i mean, it ends up depending on the job you land afterwards
but no school's education is %100 better
you pay %100 more
it's not worth it
I won't go to an out of state school
but didnt you apply to like 20 schools?
im sorry
chance is very slim
internal transfer/minoring?
acceptance means very little without my major
eh it's a rough situation
i'm sure another opportunity will present itself tho?
oof im sorry
I have nothing else to do because of running start
any college that doesn't let me start my major might as well reject me
eh doesn't mean much
hey, congrats on getting into UW!
got into UW, didn't get into engineering
thanks!
Congratulations that's awesome!
rip
but in a good way this time
i can rest in peace now lol
thank youuuuuuu!!! ‚ù§
Congrats!!!
YOOO
you deserve it
yay grats helen!
HEY, CONGRATS!
i got into comp sci üòÑ
CONGRATS
Noice
congrats!
UW op
Fuck yes thank you all
grats
congrats!!
yay!
Accepted to Pre-Health!
we broked it
it's almost as if tens of thousands of students are trying to log in
L
apparently
the whole thing crashed just now
we're happy for you nonetheless. you worked hard to get to this point. the rest of the decisions will be rolling in soon.
Thanks guys
It's all good lol
congrats though!
Which is p much what I expected
well grats
i'm sorry
oh oof
NICE
But no direct
AY
ISD has conditioned us
I got in
jkjk
lmao
Except it was just wangc
you are
nvm
oh
I kept trying wangcin19
no you're not. it's fine.
I'm so dumb
OH
Do a forgot username thing
er rip?
But I tried w that and it didn't work
like mine is salinaz
Wait what
not email
It's the same as my uw net id login right
should be your login id tho
no?
Are you supposed to use your uw email
bc thats what she uses lol
Why are you trying hotmail?
Oof
Hopefully it works out!!
It's what, a 3% acceptance rate??
But even if I got in I highly doubt I got into business which is p much the only way I'd consider going
I didn't get a rejection email so hopefully I'm good?
Try desktop or reloading?
weird
huh
L
Like stuck on this
It just isn't loading
That's what it did for me
that's what worked for me
It may ask you to log in again
try mobile?
r i p c i n d u u
Y i k e
I am STRESSED
I just hope it goes well
Guys the portal isn't loading for me
I guess
but i'm just saying that luck won't help now bc most decisions have prob already been made
you don't need to be sorry
the AOs have already decided to either punt me or not lol
I'm sorry
Yikes
it's time for the reckoning
lol luck won't help me now
Good luck!
i've heard from most of my low-to-mid-priority schools so it's just the rest to come trickling in
i am so looking forward to other school decisions tho
Sorry to hear it wasn't CS though
Congrats, David!
this is the "wow they both did and didn't know what to do with us" club
lol
lol welcome to the boat david
I got in, into Pre Sciences but I got in
that seems awfully low
15%
"We received 45,000 applicants for an expected entering class of 7,000"
Also, no one has done this yet, but @everyone might wanna check if you haven't already
If you commit and withdraw your other apps, they owe you a shit ton
misleading advertising?
Way more than that in some cases tbh
lmao
cite emotional distress
i dunno maybe i could get a lot of money from a lawsuit
Especially since you have the option to commit from the portal
Even if they did fuck up, they'd probably let you in cuz there'd be a lot of bad press otherwise
<@520095106888630348> They can't really do that to you tho
you're fine
nah
am i being weird
but i'm proud of y'all
<@!258094439636008971> i feel like there's been a horrible mistake and the letter in the mail is going to say they rejected me
but it's honestly my own fault lol
i'm glad i got in but i'm a bit bummed
let‚Äôs just all commit now
<@520095106888630348> valid
YESSSSS
guys we‚Äôre going to college
LET'S GOOOOO
ENGINEERING BOYS
to still feel insecure
is it weird
I'm so proud of y'all!
grats dude
engineering :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
<@!105508293522264064> you?
college of arts and sci
What?
help me
<@!340319804747415553> ay same
should be interesting
i'm in arts and sci
nice
Accepted, College of Engineering
i applied to super competitive ones so i'm not surprised lol
kinda sad i didn't get a major but it's all good lol
well grats y'all
CONGRATS, GUYS! I LOVE Y'ALL
nice gene!
oh hey nice
I got into the College of Engineering
^that
scrol ldown
it says requested major and admitted major
scroll down and r e a d
Where?
on the portal page
it's listed
haha nice!
How do we know the major?
i'm in pre-nursing
YES NICE JANE
hahaha jane
this is weird
yayyyy gene
guys my dad hugged me
IM IN
gimme a goddamn major, bitch
i'll prob fight for a bio/nursing/premed major spot tbh
grats!
english!!!!
major?
yay :D
I GOT IN
or did they just shove everyone into a "haha just do something else" pool
^
did anyone actually get into a major
yay
I got into UW!
they threw me into pre-science because lol why not
heyo i'm in
ooh yay
ARYA  GOT JNTO UW
you got yours?
@here
uw out
This should be exciting
Welp
Yeah I don‚Äôt have anything yet
according to her counselor based on last year, expect yours tomorrow evening üòÉ
arya‚Äôs friend got her UW acceptance
ALSO CONGRATS SALINA
they‚Äôve arrived
UW letters
Isn‚Äôt that fun
With scholarship huh
Lol I got into seattleu
I heard from Rema
No
(I'm assuming?)
Thanks, Reddit
Someone said a mistake was made on their Portal and in the process of fixing it UW revealed to them personally it was coming out tomorrow
<@472541429130854421> Where did you hear that they were coming tomorrow?
Don't ask me!!
y tho
They say 1-15 but they really release results in quick waves
Majority of in state students coming out tomorrow
March 1 - March 15, it says
haven't they been coming out since the 1st?
They're coming out tomorrow
does anyone know anyone that has gotten UW applications back?
Ok mood
respect
yeah i copied it
i saw something like that on reddit
hahaha
hot take: the top reason to want college decisions out is so you know where you're going so you can BUY CONCERT TICKETS
Lmao 5-minute application. That's actually impressive, and I have respect for it.
it's a waste of time to obsess over it, it's probably gonna be like a week till it comes out anyways, and you'll hear about it as soon as the bulk come out
i barely get any emails nowadays so ones i do get are usually important
lol
honestly guys just relax
lol I get like 20+ emails a day it don't mean shit
Then it turned out to be this.
I saw the little `1` appear next to my inbox and I was like "shit"
the biggest of Ls
looool
Ooferoni I'm sorry
L
except maybe ```git push hell```
All of this is me.
memes is probably my favorite
ib is my fave
most of our channel descriptions are really lowkey amazing
accurate tbh
lmao i guess they heard too much of a hissy fit from my parents when he heard back a week later
~2 weeks after it opened
no last year most people got them within 2-3 days
i thought they were gonna roll them out each day
idk why that's surprising
oof rly?
nope
don't expect anything for a week at least
closest i've heard was "do you know ____? yeah, their mom got into UW's master degree program," and i think that it's hilarious that that's the most we know
no
do we know anyone who's heard back from UW yet?
Things are going to work out. Don't worry about it.
You're doing great. That's what you're doing.
yeah i mean. it‚Äôs not the comparison. it‚Äôs just i don‚Äôt know what i‚Äôm doing p
<@460689096646590465> You don't have to compare yourself to anyone else. Life is something for you to take at your own pace, so don't let other people's paths take control of your own. You're doing a wonderful job, and we'll always be proud of you no matter where you are in life and how far along you are. As long as you can find a way to be happy, you're doing a good job. Life may be changing quickly and ready to throw something new at you, but remember that you've spent your entire life preparing for this, and we're gonna be right here behind you when it happens.
i don't care about you anymore
gah MIT stop sending me newsletters
yeah it feels surreal that it's march of our graduation year already
we have like what 3 months and two weeks until we graduate? in two months we‚Äôll know where we‚Äôre going
then i started thinking Wow Okay have i grown up too fast? have i been so absorbed in pursuing the future that i forgot to be present?
_well that‚Äôs not a lot of time_
holy shit we only have like 4 years until we have to get Real Life Jobs
i just breezed past her college years
i was just reading michelle obama‚Äôs book and i got to the section where she has a job at this law firm and she met obama and then i realized
my parents taught me to stay ahead in life and i‚Äôve always been ahead in life so here i am having a quarter life crisis
Quarter life crisis is usually in your 20s a few years after college
What happened?
michelle obama is giving me a quarter life crisis
Not that I've heard
I thought some people were already hearing back from them?
Got official confirmation that results should start coming out within a week
Yep, sounds about right
h
That moment of panic when you get a thin-ass letter from UW in the mail, but then you look more closely, and it's from UW Medicine, addressed to your parents, and it's just an ad from their urgent care hospital
<3333
CONGRATS EMI!!
thaaaanks
Congrats!
yeet
Yes queeeen
üëç
Y A A A A A S G E T E M
4 FOR 4 BIHHHHH
OH MY GOSH CONGRATS!!!
A H
Nice congrats!!!
I GOT INTO ROCHESTER
Ivy Day is March 28th?
i printed a calendar and marked it instead of doing Any Work back when the EE and TOK essay was a thing
üòÉ
Stanford has a "by April 1" policy. Most schools do. They usually get it out a bit earlier tho.
Someone told me today
Stanford is April 1
So a rejection by definition does not have to be a terrible event
Getting a college rejection does not always necessarily make you feel devastated
Lmao, Stanford's got nothing on me. I'm p sure I'm in somewhere else by then, so it'll mostly be like "oh, okay." It's just be kinda funny, especially if I get into another school I wanna go to
it‚Äôs your 18th birthday! we‚Äôll make it so great you‚Äôll forget about stanford
don‚Äôt be put down by a college decision
So I just found out Stanford typically delivers decisions on the last Friday of March every year, so I guess I am getting a ~~decision~~ rejection on my birthday after all lol
But hopefully by that time, I'm accepted somewhere else, so I don't think I'll take it too hard
L
if someone wins this game of bingo, every college should just immediately change their mind and send full rides to that person
she weeps softly. a tear runs down her cheek and falls into her bingo board. it lands on the free space.

bingo, she whispers
now you can play bingo while bawling your eyes out
oh that would be fun
just predictions of stuff that'll happen over the course of the next month: acceptances (but no rejects), decision dates, delays, etc.
college bingo
you know what we should do?
lmao rip parinita
so far i owe one boba but parinita owes me five
all my bets with people are boba based
do we like boba
being miserable and being miserable
and what don‚Äôt we like
what do we like
hm
ideas?
maybe something that doesn‚Äôt endanger our health
or something like it
we should all do the hot sauce thing together
fun stuff
oh no
one time, i saw this guy online post "i will literally eat shit if the mariners win this game" after they were losing a ton, and then they made the biggest comeback in MLB since 2001
he‚Äôs so in pain that he doesn‚Äôt even look nervous about opening his letters
lmao
maybe he likes hot sauce
it's like one of those "i'll do x if i get into y" things but with hot sauce and just "i will cronch the hot sauce regardless"
that's no fun
damn
why
regardless of rejection or acceptance
he‚Äôs taking a spoonful of hot sauce every time he gets a letter
ah okay
im counting on it
i‚Äôll update you
is he taking a lot of Ls?
never heard of it
it‚Äôs called da bomb
and how many has he taken so far
what kind
a guy named gene is taking a shot of hot sauce every time he gets rejected
i‚Äôm watching more college decision videos
congrats!!!
Thanks guys!
grats David!!
nice!
Congrats!
Got accepted to WSU!
lmao
or build UGene right down the street to compete
we need to replace CWU with UGene
issy has the college town feel tho
yeah
tbh we're closer to redmond than issy is
and it's close to redmond for internships/jobs too
honestly, now that i think of it, issaquah could make a p decent college town
but we gotta turn sammamish-issy into a college town
eugene oregon is the best place for UGene im just saying
but when i went there, it seemed p chill
my parents of the University of Oregon for a bit, and they keep talking about how eugene was doing nude parades and how they thought it was kinda degenerate
there's a youtube channel called universiTea and its run by a friend group based in washington state and they all got into ivies and stuff
ehhh
located in eugene oregon
lmao
that actually sounds legit
pronounced "eugene"
or UGene for short
University of Gene
"wholesome degenerates university"
needs to be named after us
nah skyline is too vague
skyline university
what if we all just made our own school
f l e x
one year i got a list of the previous year's senior destinations from my counselor
that's far from scientific tho
they make everyone do that poster boi at the end of the year
wait i'm pretty sure they do
do the counselors even ask where we go lmao
idk
do the counselors keep track?
but we usually have 1-2 most years?
how do you know how many people?
idr
how many ppl?
rice is nice
really?
we do okay with rice
oh wait
do they?
and they have good food
it is a very good school overall
i'd be damn impressed by anyone who went
but like
i mean, i wouldnt solely cuz i dont like most east coast bois
like, as much as we meme it compared to the other ivies, it's still heckin' cornell
personally i probably wouldn't go
i guess
it's fucking cornell still tho
from what i've heard it's basically halfway public school
cornell tbh isn't super prestigious
brown is on its way down
true
dartmouth objectively has the coolest name out of the ivies tho
Oh oof
i didn't apply there but it's more hit and miss than upenn
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
dartmouth is a dartboard
I didn't apply them, but I'm curious
What about the other ivies?
idk who else
susan's year had tiffany
like misty got in last year
some years we do okay, others we don't
UPenn is hit and miss
We do?
and UPenn
lol caltech rip
we have a good record with CMU
oh yeah mit caltech
stanford, harvard, yale, etc
MIT for one
More tea: which schools do we have a terrible track record with?
Never thought of it like that
L
I guess
I'm not saying that such emphasis on athletics is necessarily a positive, but this is an interesting reason why they want athletes
That's an oof
Wow, I never actually thought of it like cannon fodder
lmaoooo cannon fodder
yeah heard of that
you know the small fish big pond effect? it's where people who are extremely qualified and go to top schools end up doing poorly there because they feel less qualified compared to their genius peers. (side note: it's statistically better to choose a mid tier school and be the best than to choose a top school and be average) 
This means that no matter who the top schools choose, they will always end up with unhappy people who are very smart/capable but just less so than the most genius people. In the 1950s Harvard instated a "happy bottom quarter" plan in which they would accept large numbers of athletes with mediocre grades, so they could be the cannon fodder for everyone else but still be happy because they find fulfillment in sports.
rip
I can probably lift like 2
Oof
True true
i can barely lift 50
no
but do i have the commitment to be an athlete
yeah
do i wish i could go to those schools
mad props to the athletes
but honestly
That's interesting
Wtf lol
they were just doing sports and not really actual classwork anymore
O o f
basically the school got busted for MAKING UP MAJORS for athletes
What happened?
i still find the UNC athlete scandal hilarious
I'm kinda interested
but
the athletes work hard in their own right
Idk where our atheletes are going tbh
anyway
i know, it's ok
i personally don't mean it
i don't think we should throw shade at athletes getting into top schools, no personal judgement but i read something interesting a few days ago about why schools do that
They're wholesome bois, and Evan was like providing huge emotional support through my SAT crisis
hm helen?
aw that's nice gene
ok something interesting
Evan and Jay Sheih are like the best family friends you could ever ask for
he's an athlete so
for baseball
okay 1 acceptance
shade
i call
yeah
he's going to stanford
cole h
I love the dude
i think our grade is doing really great
OH FUCK
but there was an afr-amer cheerleader in Susan's year
Evan is our family friend
EVAN
idr her name
BUT we have two princetons and one cornell so like we're doing good in a sense
and um
there was evan sheih
one person got in when we were in tenth grade
they like our athletes sometimes
no one does great with stanford
0 acceptances
not really
not really
UH
uh
We do ok with Stanford, right?
yeah i think she is
i wonder how that'll turn out
yep
vanderbilt
ay isn't macy scott going there
oh right i applied there too
a lot of people on the senior destinations page are going to wsu
or just in matheny's block
Ooooo nice
i think we sent 3 kids to vanderbilt last year
lmao
I haven't heard anyone recommend WSU tbh
LOL
he told me not to go to WSU
F
lmao
i was doing my consultation with my surgeon for my wisdom teeth removal and he explained to me UCLA acceptance rates for a solid half hour before actually getting into my x rays
yeah it does actually
Also <@340319804747415553> woooooo that bodes well!
So it balances out
Yeah, but I think just less people applied this year
california is money struggling rn
damn
Some UCs went up this year
there's an interesting reason why Umich likes us
UCLA basically cut down on all out of state apps
ACTUALLY
I know my brother was one of the first with UW --> UMich (maybe the first)
UCs are lowering admit rate so this year may be interesting
could be wrong
i think we do okay with usc
not sure
err idk
(thanks for not being an embarrassment, sis)
Does Berkeley technically count now after last year?
And apparently Duke
I know we do for UMich
i think susan was one of the first skyline --> duke students to go there actually
Duke lol
What schools do we have a good track record for?
Three people went last year
Skyline has a good track record for Duke
it's also strongly tied to cornell's bio school so...
Damn, nice
I applied to Duke but to engineering so I won't be competing with you hopefully
applied economic management and  business administration
Is Duke historically nice to Skyline IB?
What is AEM?
there's at least 5-6 other than me
yeah
so that'll be interesting to see too
Really?
I mean, you never know
and a lot of shs kids applied to duke
we'll see
Oh
Ooooo nice! Good luck!
but idk if they want to adopt another skyline kid after stephanie
i'm praying i get into AEM in cornell
That's a good attitude to have
eh, keep the roads open i guess
Oh
Don't worry about not knowing
but it's also like
well i do
idk what i wanna do with my life
but yeah
she is
Reinsch sounds like an absolute L
me: ... uh in what context? i don't understand
F
i stared at her blankly as she continued to repeat HOW ELSE CAN YOU WRITE 8
i was asking her how to do a proof
literally today
Guys, if life ever fails us, we can all go and become SAT tutors
(pay me)
Lmaooooo
(also i can teach math better than reinsch)
Good science teachers are very in demand
If you get a teaching degree from a good school you can teach at a private school that will pay more
for some reason i'm absurdly good with kids
That's fair
i'm p open to anything at this point
i honestly don't know
What kind of teacher? High school?
be the next vB
Honestly I've considered that lol
i might pull the yeet and just go be a teacher
I think you could be successful in anything you put your mind to
Nice
lots of interesting stuff to look for
i actually don't hate legal codes
Ooh nice
potentially? law
business
Other than comp sci, what fields would you consider?
If it means anything, we support you through whatever it is you want to pursue
^
That is a difficult situation to be in
That's not the move if that's not something you want
I really hope things work out for you
they want me to go compsci
I'm sorry
Oooof
my parents are very against me going into med
If you don't the only thing against you would be lack of demonstrated interest in comp sci other than girls who code
Also oh
but i don't see myself doing it longterm
Oh
I thought you wanted to study medicine
i'm good at coding when i try
Wait, why comp sci?
i kinda hate that thought
idk
but that
i was pretty open about going to uw
Maybe
It's not unlikely you'll get in
and honestly?
like my parents want to force me to stay at uw if by some miracle of god i get direct admit into compsci
Really hoping one of my other options will pull through
That's valid
I don't want to stay at UW either
That makes sense
hopefully uw works for y'all who want it
but that's a me thing
i don't really want to stay in state
Oh
That true
idk if i want to appeal for uw
If I don't get UW comp sci I'm def appealing
Appeals are more likely to work for your in state schools than anywhere else
It worked for one of my friends at UW
my appeal: "i gave my whole heart to you"
"but not as scrub as you think i am"
I think this is part of what the appeal process is for
"hi i am a scrub"
And you can always appeal
schools want you its just they can only take so many
its hard to remember that schools aren't fighting you
While some safety schools are notorious for the big yield protecc, most are happy to give you an acceptance and a scholarship
pretend may does'nt exist
laughs nervously
uhhhh
once march blows over everything will be great
but unlikeliness doesn't stop the overwhelming feeling of impending doom which i understand
^
honestly its a fair fear but again like you said it's unlikely
bc rn i just want options for college
but i'm afraid that i'm gonna hit a zone where my "safer" schools will cut me for possible overqualify while i get shanked at my riskier apps
i know it's hella unlikely
yes
the thing that concerns me the most?
what are you scared about
i'm honestly p scared
i don't wanna college
oof
Any time
thank
This puppy here believes in you
It'll work out
h
We believe in you
Things will be ok
H
To pad the pain of getting rejected by one so you can see your acceptances into another?
WHY
IVY DAY IS THE SAME DAY AS UC SCHOOLS
Yep
do they hate us
28th
all ivy leagues send out decisions on the same day?
as in
there's an ivy day?
We want you if that counts for anything
being wanted : ' )
thats the best part
True. You may not know which school you want, but when the time comes, you'll know which schools want you.
i can pick and choose as i please when the time comes
no expectations
its okay its kind of nice this way
Aww, I'm sorry
i don't know where i want to go anymore
hey you have a target school
This has now been permenantly embedded into my mind
I  k n o w
I don't need no calendar
mark your calendar
<@460689096646590465> Thanks, I hate it
at least for this guy it did
I should be doing homework, but I'm looking at memes
<@!258094439636008971> last year USC decisions came out march 25
i should be doing hw but im watching people react to college decisions
<@460689096646590465> Also, if we all have one communal brain cell, does that make us a hive mind?
So happy for you! You earned it!
WOO JEESOO! CONGRATS!
woo go jeesoo
^
If they liked you that means UW will most likely want you!
OMG congrats!!!
was it the washington opportunity scholarship?
yay grats
guys im excited and nervous for the uw decision
so im gonna ! get this bread
but uw is a very real, viable, and amazing option for me
i can only use it if i wo to uw
yes
take it
money is money
!!!!!!!!
thank you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
it may not be much but actual humans in an office looked at my application and decided i was the one worth investing in!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CONGRATS
HELL YEAH
i got a scholarship!!!!!!!!!!
hell yeah!!!!!!!!
we're actually so smart
i know we like to joke that we all collectively have one communal brain cell but like
I'd still want to double check
also idk if I'd ever trust something like that
too bad you can't put that on your college application
Someone on Reddit said they made a program that would automatically log in to their student portals and display all of their college decisions in one table, color coded for acceptances and denials
I just wanted DigiPen and then all of the college stuff hapenned
no, i did a long time ago
is it bad i lost all fucks about college?
at least that‚Äôs what the email said
‚Äúaround the end of march‚Äù meaning march 28
ye that‚Äôs same with the uc schools
It looks like decisions won't all be released at the same time but staggered over a few days
GAH
Thanks!
im glad it went well
ooo
UPenn
which school
It did! Thanks. The guy was super chill.
Hope it went well!!
I have an interview in like 15 minutes lol
the truth is sometimes surprisingly soft i suppose
Very soft
Helle, Jeesoo,

We are writing to tell you that you a wonderful human being and fantastic friend who will go far in life.

We believe in you.

-your friends
Hello jeesoo, 

We are writing to tell you that 
You FUCKING suck and we dont want you 
Suck my ass

-uw
and crush everyone's hopes and dreams after ivy day
so they can hit my bday with a rejecc
march 29
Got it
Oh so mar 27
And procrastination factors
They just send whenever they're done
Just hit me with that letter fam
procrastinate
they just wanna like
because they're like us
So mar 15
Less than one month !!!
Why the fuck is that window so big
Lol
Mar h 1-15
march 1-15
I just wanna go to uw
When does uw come out
‚Äúyeah i go to UWU‚Äù
hopefully
Would the University of Western Utah be called "UWU"
Yeah, I've been getting NYU ads on Facebook
O h
instagram and their sponsored ads
What
i
That‚Äôs a mood
same, and it physically hurt
it took me a second to realize they‚Äôre weren‚Äôt talking about common app
h
i internally screeched
i was doing online stats, and then this popped up:
L
I just wanna never hear back so I don't have to think about it
I heard USC's acceptance rate is projected to be 11%
Also, F
I don't think it was the fact that my dad cooked a soup out of milk and a blue soda that set me off tho
Brain had me convinced at first, but it soon became pretty clear that something was up
I finally had one of those dreams where I got into college
If we do something like this we can just include people who vote they will participate in a poll instead of the entire group by default
Or any group outside the og group (it was a bad idea to begin with, but I just want a recount cuz I'm petty, so I refuse to acknowledge)
Idk if this is a good idea with a larger group tbh
I think FredBoat gets a 10/10/10
I trust people not to vote for themselves and only take it once
And no one scores like below a 5 on any category in the server, so idk
And everyone will just inflate their own
I don't know some people well enough to be fair on some of them tho
O H
And three numbers for each of us considering we don't vote for ourselves
poll the server on the server
Do we have enough people to warrant it? There's just four of us
hmm, an anonymous google form would be interesting
I  W A N T  M Y  R E C O U N T
This is a great idea, and we need to do this as soon as possible
I think that's where your confusion might be coming from <@193229269076279298>
I said we should NOT give her numbers on this one
yea we have
I think we've discussed this lmao
I know
holy shit the real world is going to hurt her
kenna's not unintelligent, she's actually probably quite smart like objectively, but she's also overly emotional, idealistic/unrealistic, and extremely not-self-aware
<@193229269076279298>
Wait, explain
...
so I'm very torn
but I also like bad ideas
I vote this as a bad idea
It's kinda rude to do this thing behind people's backs
So let's like just not include her
We never got her numbers to start
idk if she wants to talk to me
Idk
That's downright offensive to me
are we still counting Makenna
We didn't get Makenna's numbers on this, and I still ranked lowest
oh wait
Nic is dumbest
agreed
<@193229269076279298> I refuse to believe I'm the dumbest person in the group, cuz after two more years of knowing you guys, that's factually wrong
I think it really brings out the data's eyes
nast
and blue
oh wait there's yellow now
noah why are you making the edges drunk christmas
i find it interesting that gene is the only one with decimals
I swear to God y'all will have higher opinions of me now that it's been 2 years, so let's fucking recount
Better
so edge
damn all black
Lol
better
Because the numbers burn my eyes too
same cindy
lol
ow
whyd you make it so bright
Yes
oh you want the og people to redo it?
"these bitches" refers to us and not the numbers
rounding up
No, not that kinda of rounding
never round if you don't have to
uh why rounding?
Yeah, but we only did ourselves to stay wholesome
didn't we rate ourselves on this system a while back
<@193229269076279298> We're rounding these bitches up and doing a recount
Did Nic hand me a fucking 4 cuz I will fuck him up
Thank
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10P-JECQxaBtr7Mn9mshDe_lZseJCKWPJvtaxiWKD6WY/edit?usp=sharing
Also, I want a recount, because I think I rank higher after 2 years
someone's hangry
rip
But seriously FEED ME THE NUMBERS
what info damnit
<@193229269076279298> how much do you have on me? ;)
great that's not concerning at all
w t f
I have pages of information on <@!340319804747415553>
I mean, I think I do, but idk how well
`i always keep data`
Cuz I don't remember it lol
... that's totally not concerning at all
Can I see it please?
I always keep data
of course I do
red one, Nicholas's old blue one, Gabe's light blue one that I stole, green one with giant bleach patches, Muay Thai one, Neon Yellow one
<@193229269076279298> do you still have the data?
go answer gene lol
noah
L
Damn, I'm not even dming him and he's ignoring me
and then i got that fat reject
i used to wear the stanford sweatshirt a decent amount
oh I have a bunch
are you sure bout that <@!193229269076279298>
I just cycle through them on lazy days
I could list my like 6-7 go-to sweatshirts easy
Actually, do you still have the data?
<@!340319804747415553> if anyone is going to steal it, it will be him
<@193229269076279298> G I V E  R E C O U N T
lmao
and so does Abhay
i practically live in my duke sweatshirt at this point
I like the sweatshirt
lol rip
I'd make fun of him for that specific sweatshirt but I do that too
<@193229269076279298> btw, I want a recount on that attractiveness thing from 2 years ago, cuz that way genuinely interesting
lol
and a muay thai sweatshirt
tshirts and bathrobes are p lit
he lives on t shirts and bathrobes
I get the sense that you don't care and don't really have a particular style
not really
don't I normally <@!503787499605458954>?
lmaoooo gene
all out gay fashion pls and thank u
won't disappoint
I told Jane "they look like the pen pineapple apple pen meme from a few years back"
stupid looking in the best way
it's hilariously
i wanna see noah dressed ridiculously
Oh
ok ngl
no we found gold ones
Silver
Not even gold
I think they were silver pants
we were trying on jackets at macys for shits and giggles
I T  H U R T
good god
we even found the matching gold pants later
i don't have a gold jacket and neither does noah
I don't even wanna know
explanation
lmao
MY EYES STILL BURN
i'm being e x p o s e d
lord
oh no
THAT WAS A JOKE
NO WE DONT
SHE AND NOAH WEAR GOLD JACKETS IT'S A TRAP
uh rip?
DONT
<@!340319804747415553> hell yes
I take mental notes when people criticize my appearance
but anyway anyone wanna go thrifting with me sometime?
pinterest is great for fashion inspo
do some research
ME
I always need clothing advice
now i shamelessly sleep in front of reinsch
anyways appearance isn't that hard to get right
i used  to have trouble with that
<@340319804747415553> I'm listening
er rip
actually nvm
Like I have trouble sleeping in class
random but since we're talking about clothes and shit
so I've never actually gotten the impression that you're that sleep-deprived
I  c a n ' t
somehow you don't fall asleep in class
L
I care, but I have other priorities at other points in my life, and I'm at "fuck it, I'm graduating soon anyways, and I've cemented myself as one of the most sleep-deprived individuals, so let's try again in college"
I imagine it can be done
or is it that you don't do anything because you don't care
do you not care because you don't think anything can be done
Just because I put in effort doesn't mean I'm doing it right
this is where i think this is a chicken or egg situation
No, like
this is very false
...
I imagine that even if I did put in effort, it might have 0 impact
Eh, I mean
if you don't care much though that's Valid too
I know you don't like to but if you put effort into your appearance you'd boost that score real easily
double self-affirmed ouch
When I say unaminously tho, that includes me tho lol
that is a real ouch
gene you're cute
riperoni
d a m n gene
/share it
`send it`?
<@193229269076279298> Remember when we did that thing two years back with Nic, Bethany, and Makenna, and y'all unaminously voted me the least attractive member of the group lol
send it and drag yourself down w me
updoot
and it's your comment I'm upvoting
I'm pretty sure you've done worse
rip?
whatever I've been implicated in way worse
Lol
......... oh dear
sigh
I still have the screenshot
it's ok
thanks guys
lol
the sc exists
for me cindy's comment comes before noah's
well
dying
i am
That's not what shows up on mine
l m a o o o o o
fuck
ahahahaha
i agree gene
lmao
We're not allowed to compliment him anymore
it is
bye bye bye
my timing is impeccable
they all look the same to me tbh
Guys, this is what happens
bi bi bi
why
............ noah
jesus christ noah
NOAH NO
I first notice the size of the bulge
^^
that's why finding clothes that suit your body type is important
i relate
damn rip
Which is exactly why my clothes are super mediocre
welcome back lol
you're not wrong gene
noah hi :D
Clothes are makeup for your body change my mind
but Im saying like a lot of times they hide what your body actually looks like
clothes can make someone so much more attractive
oh clothes 100% matter
clothes matter too
in general w people I feel like you focus more on the face right away bc that's the more recognizable part and also clothes
yes, i'm a giraffe, i know
ok see
like with strangers and family friends and whatever
my mom's voice: salina you're so Tall
just in general
excluding noah
How much do you trust Noah's comments?
Well
I mean, I imagine there's an exception, but I can't think of one
i've gotten more comments on my body than my face
i would say no
build
definitely definitely not imo
no
no
lmfao
not a fan
Wait, quick question:
Is a person's face always the biggest indicator of attractiveness (regardless of gender)? Cuz I just thought of it, and I don't know any exceptions.
im referring to the drivers license hair
but i am biased as all get out
I honestly can't remember
but if it gets really fucked up and just kinda relaxes, it's p cute
when his hair was longer
i prefer the up hair over the down hair
it can be like p suave and borderline douchey
noah's hair has like two modes
Ok, I also really like Noah's hair
<@193229269076279298> What are you hiding
lol
oh dear
no
what
Righi Righi
Ok, so we need to find the fourth brother now
me too
i just googled it
he's right
please
lol
google it
no
but I mean I could be wrong
I feel like he's just making shit up or going off a fan theory
oh my god wait that's right
someone ran out of ideas for kid names
It's Mario Mario and Luigi Mario
gabe's defining feature is his nose
That's why they're the Mario bros
Mario
anyway
woah emi idk
jk
nintendo
i feel so bad saying that
whats mario and luigi's last name
gabe's nose doesn't work super well with the rest of his features?
Nicholas has stronk jaw (p nice)
Gabe has a slimmer version of Nicholas
dissection of the righi bros
be flattered
we're objectifying you
<@!193229269076279298>
what is happening
Gabe and Nicholas have more defined faces
gabe is tall and lanky
noah's prettier than gabe
idk about gabe though I've only seen him once
i've seen one really pixelized photo of nicholas so i beg to differ
i agree gene
ok I think noah has a better face than nicholas
uh
Noah has a better face than both his brothers
nobody Actually thinks noah is ugly here
so now we're here
you literally said your bf wasn't hot and I know you were joking but I felt the need to validate him
or chest hair
also i don't understand the appeal of facial hair
lol you guys
That's the tea
i didn't read it then
that's what I said
noah's pretty that's the word im looking for
Noah has a really nice face
also YES lashes on guys
I mean, it wasn't the ONLY reason, but it was part of it
he's got better lashes than me
noah has nice cheekbones tho
hahaha
his jawline doesn't exactly cut through diamonds
Seeing Chris Hemsworth with short hair convinced me I can still look decent with shorter hair
noah's a pretty flower boy don't deny it
that's one way to look at it haha
pretty flower boys huh
Little-known fact
somebody's gotta love the pretty flower boys
Ok, so
wow ok we have very different preferences
r i p
scare me
any white celebrity male named chris
hm interesante
<@503787499605458954> I think you mean edgy
im not a fan of sharp jawlines and noses and angled bone structures in the face in general
sharp
Is a "hard facial feature" the opposite of a "soft" one?
huh interesting
its mostly like a certain combination of traits not specific ones if that makes sense
soft facial structures
feminine features
and for late night chats with u bitches
:D
shh you need a laptop for college apps
<@460689096646590465> proceed
LOL
lmao
this is the college apps channel
DAMN
Number 1 most attractive trait in guys:
Ability to buy laptops
uh oh
lmao
Wait, Emi, don't answer that. I need to say something first
that white boys don't have
that is a fat mood
what traits do you consider attractive
hahaha gene
yes considering white guys typically don't have traits that i find attractive
Noah can eat Thai food, so that makes him more attractive than Nic
lmao
damn
high praise
damn
noah is actually one of the only white guys i have ever found attractive
but yeah he's not not hot
No, the rest of us are just unattractive pieces of shit lol
I probably wouldn't call him hot
is that why you be making moves on him
okay noah is not not hot
damn gene
We did a thing in our other friend group where we ranked each other's attractiveness, and I think I actually gave Noah the highest rating out of the group
so imma shut up
i'm biased
objectively noah is kinda pretty
ok sometimes I do feel like we're too mean
Not that we're not already
At that point, we're p fucked
lmao
<@460689096646590465> If we've actually accelerated climate change fast enough that it can drown Cali in four years, I'll just drown with it thanks
:p
For all the times Noah said "that wasn't a denial or confirmation," that was a straight up confirmation
one reason i actually might not go to cali is bc the Big Storm is coming and climate change is gonna Drown That Bitch
lol facts emi
Try Cali schools. They're so hot, they spend all their time complaining that their dorms don't have air conditioning. In fact, not just guys are hot. Everyone's hot in Cali. Unless they have AC. Then they're normal.
not noah
what are hot guys lol
jk
none of them
top 5 colleges with the hottest guys
us news will rank WSU in the top 5 if i choose to attend there
*hair flip*
sure dude haha
lmao
exactly
this methodology is valid.
we should pick a college with at least one cute guy.
meaning i can go to any of the colleges, because even if there are no cute guys there, me attending increases the population of cute guys by one
that's how it works, right?
its meant to be
100% lol
oh well would you look at that
im bold but not that bold
n o
Is it from you???
is it yours
theres One comment on his video
Be sure to leave easily identifiable messages on his videos
üòè
stalking is the way to his heart
nice
Lmaoooo true
he Just showed us where his dorm is
it shouldn't be hard to find him
how cute *one* guy is there
yes that's wise i should choose which school i should go to solely based on how cute the guys are there
there's this cute guy and he goes to irvine maybe i should go to irvine
Dorm tours and stuff
I obsessively watched those a few weeks back
except im only watching the ones where they're moving into the colleges i applied to
i have been watching  college move in day vlogs a lot
I'm ok if it stay February forever
"kinda terrified" is an understatement
i'm like kinda terrified to hear from USC
L
Hahaha I'm terrified of a USC or NYU rejecc coming in on my bday
sh i. sh
i will flip a table
if it comes on my birthday
L
As few as ten days
Oh God there's less than a month :o
Got it, expecting to hear back Feb 27 or I will call in the next day and throw a hissy fit
march 1-15 just expect the latest date
Oh, alright. Thanks!
they don't give us a strict date
mid march
When's UW's decision date again? I thought I knew when I was, but then I saw some other things, so I'm kinda confused.
I will not denying that score now reads Noah: 1 Gene: 0
But, Noah, my dear friend, rivalries take place over a long duration of repeated occurances
Either one of us could have gained or lost an unknown amount of skill in that time
Both of us are now two days older and thus two days wiser
Ah, but you see
there is no speculation about who won in smash though
`long speculated`
<@193229269076279298> I have my doubts, because that's hilariously ironic coming from someone who's been long speculated to be a bottom
he enjoys being beaten by me
that's <@258094439636008971>'s secret, he's a masochist
Heheheh
that‚Äôs so ominous
r i p
Oh, you'll find out soon enough
where is this unfounded confidence coming from
<@193229269076279298> I'll hand you your ass once we have our rematch in Smash.
rip?
but I'll accept rent in the form of ass, ass or ass
I know the saying is gas, grass or ass
I'll show up every Sunday to play smash and then leave when you guys start to smash
... i hope not
Dear lord is every party at Noah's condo going to be an orgy
Noah you‚Äôve unleashed a monster
No no no
petition to turn noah‚Äôs condo into a sex house
EMI YES
Emi, no
Jfc what is happening
üëÄ
like i said the more the merrier
Did you ditch me and Cindy or are you going to add us too to make a sixsome
This is going to turn into a foursome
<@!340319804747415553> i‚Äôm sorry
<@!193229269076279298> to answer your question, why don‚Äôt you make me
then what‚Äôs the Point
You guys need a condom not a condo
Please don't get too raunchy in that condo
<@503787499605458954> *high five*
I don't know, can you *come*
oh my god can i come
My parents are considered buying a condo down at UW for me and Nicholas to live in, who would want to join us :)
Haha like that housing scenario <@258094439636008971> brought up a few weeks ago
90s sitcom
THATS the question
What if we all moved together because our parents all bought houses without rooms for us
no
No the real question is
Hmm...
Late-night question
What if all of our parents move in together?
Lmao my parents are also looking into moving
Not even our parents like Skyline. They don't wanna be around it anymore either.
My parents are doing the exact same thing lol
i don‚Äôt even get a room
my parents really out here getting ready to move the second i leave for college
Also, I checked my messages like 20 minutes ago, and listened to someone offer me an interview at 4AM oop
Glad to hear it went well!
awesome! no problem!
<@472541429130854421> Thanks for all the tips and stuff
Just finished my stanford interview, went pretty well!
oh lmao
I said that because I already checked the mail lol
Yep I got it too
grats!
I'm so happy for y'all!
Ayyyy nice!
that's a major weight off my chest tbh
god bless
yeah I did
Congrats guys!
ooh grats to him!
did you get it
evon is a finalist üòÑ
lmao
I was wrong about the school thing I guess but that's what it said on their faq so idk
alex and I got our letters today
<@!472541429130854421> check your mail
I have good timing apparently
wait lmao
and I know they send by mail but I'm 90% sure they send it to the school
individual schools offer a lot more
finalist status is way more important than the mini scholarships nmsc gives
^
Some colleges will guarantee a scholarship tho if they accept you and you land National Merit Finalist (e.g. USC, although I didn't get it, so eh)
National Merit Finalist info is in the physical mail. Getting finalist doesn't mean you get the money. Actual award decisions are released in March
<@503787499605458954> I haven't heard anything about it yet
Also, good luck, guys. I'm sure it'll turn out fine. Again, if it's 90%, chances are you made it. And being a semifinalist still has perks in itself.
Commended scholar gang ayyy...
L
But being in the 10% that doesn't terrifies me lol
Gah I know it's supposed to be that like 90% of WA semifinalists make it
I know it's kinda why I don't wanna ask
plus they're doing midyear reports
the counselors are prob as over it as we are
tbf
uh L
oh nat merit
And they send it to the school
But counselors haven't said anything
Cause I think it's lowkey supposed to already be out
nms?
<@472541429130854421> have you heard anything about nms
I'm so paranoid
You got this
how's life cindy
I'm proud though
we'll see
hm
i got admitted to health sciences and they have a really cool health sciences + business admin degree program.... but i'm wondering how well i can handle premed on top of that
Oh you're right
idk
tbh they prob got back to me earlier bc honors?
thanksss <3
congrats <@!340319804747415553> !
<@340319804747415553> wow congratulations!!!
Nope, me neither
I haven't gotten anything yet should I be worried O_O
congrats!!
Congrats, dude. Ya earned it.
Wow, nice! That's super awesome! Thicc monies!
also moneyyyyyyyyyyyy
CONGRATS! Omg, that's so awesome!
finally got a decision yay
thanks, guys! i'm actually p happy to finally hear this.
lol congrats
nice
hey hey hey ya boi got accepted into WSU
when do you hear back
This is dumb lol
No I set my password
I think you can call them and say you missed the original email
Uh
can they do that
uh
What the hell lol my Georgia tech portal password is apparently expiring in a week
le gasp
im just kidding
you'd be surprised
eh
not the skyline people
... most
most people have two brain cells to rub together
i'm joking
lol rip
<@!340319804747415553> hey, don't say that. i can't imagine anyone would want to be stuck at skyline next year surrounded by idiots in the middle of nowhere. like, that ain't even funny. that's just scary.
at least it'll be fun
wherever you do end up tho, it'll be a great place
if i end up surrounded by idiots in the middle of nowhere
oh yeah, i get you, hahaha
i don't care *that* much about where i end up
lemme know if there's anything i can do to help
glad to hear you're holding up alright
but like
upenn would be cool
idc really
alright, well
it happened
i don't have any qualms against how the interview went
*unlocks 4th grade gene humor*
i'm okay
cough dna
cough genes
ofc you're with me bc i'm with everyone
i thought you were gonna say
oh
do you wanna talk about it?
im sorry
also
of course you're with me. everyone's with me, because we're all in this together supporting each other, so you're with everyone here
now i'm getting concerned lmfao
so
i did get this spiel at the end of my interview tho
i'm with gene
and we'll all be here to support and congratulate you as stuff happens
so whatever happens, there's going to be a place for you where you can feel happy
any college that accepts you will want the best out of you and will in turn give you every opportunity to be happy and call that place your home
you're gonna end up at college that will be more than happy to have you and welcome you with open arms no matter who accepts you
whatever happens, there will be brighter days ahead
no
how about i die
good luck to everyone who applied!
L
now i'm really not getting any work done today
i heard some UC Berkeley acceptances come out today and tomorrow
They made me feel popular
I kinda miss college emails
Thank you, guys. I'm feeling a lot better.

I think it was called citizen caf√©. I only had a iced tea, so idk how their food or anything else is, but they have cr√™pes and some other stuff that sounded good
Thank you!
Best of luck
Just not spectacular
Doesn't sound awful
Also rip
Which cafe
This caf√© is super cool tho, and I should def take y'all here if we're ever in Seattle
Again, it was probably ok, cuz she was just here to check that I'm not a degenerate
Also, I'm a stuttering mess and have a fake-seeming awkward laugh
She yawned about 5 times in the span of like ten minutes at the end, and we talked mostly about IB before I was like "wait, shit, I shouldn't be talking about classes"
oof
what happened
u ok?
I'm probably overreacting lol
oh nooo
I just put the L in college with my interview lmao
lol yeah
he sure does talk a lot
good shit
he sent me a business/political research paper
haha he's a cool guy
yes
was your interviewer Doren Spinner
yes
Was it the same daughter?
and apparently deeya was there today
i saw jeesoo and lisa
lol it was an interview w brown
Children are so precious and stupid
That's so cute
it was cute anyway
and spelled believe wrong
my brown interviewer's daughter drew me a picture
ooh i had something similar happen
<@460689096646590465> that's so cute omg
my college interviewer brought his daughter and she made me a bracelet
Yeah
To clarify, college interviews can be excused absences, right? I don't have to tell them it's an appointment or something else?
when's the wedding
they must really love you
i get emails from domino's on a near-daily basis
let's apply to domino's pizza
they sent you two emails
they must really want you to attend
domino's pizza
i really want to attend
with absolute certainty
but i can say
im getting all these college emails
I love Sabrina
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w46r4fqUJU0
i also recommend
lol i watched that a few days ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqmrRxLlZTs
thought you would enjoy <@!460689096646590465>
:/
ofc its a scam
its css
And if you don't get it, they'll still take it anyways
i'm suspicious that they're making you pay to get money
are you getting scammed?
thats
B o i i i
$80 for financial aid
$80
But I gotta agree
There's a lot of competition for that title tho
i Officially declare Harvard College the bitchiest ivy league
for real
Fuck CollegeBoard
Well then, let's all say it together now:
oh it's no big deal
Sorry, my misunderstanding
Oh hey, nice!
but I'm aiming for state dept not congress
LOL no all good don't get me wrong I wanna do public service
My b
Oh
don't really wanna go into actual politics
oof I like
Part of that is on other colleges. The UCs are big enough where I can give them a pass. But other small colleges hurt to look at with how many people they're turning away
The yield is high cuz they desperate to get in
People want their education, fam
I honestly don't feel much pity
so overcrowding
yield rate in the UCs was higher than ever and they didn't anticipate it
last year they suffered
Get to choose the cream of the crop at their will
They have all that choice
Boi, they're thriving
They're suffering?
i guess colleges have to suffer for a few more years
Stanford is almost embarrassed to talk about admissions
2007 is the peak birth rate and it's been on a decline since then
and also purdue and its lack of housing
hence selectivity
Cuz college campuses have not expanded enough to meet demand
I meant that in terms of overpopulation
Wait
Oh
G o o d
so kids 2000-2007 have the worst
fertility in the US decreased after 2007
Or do they just not cuz of disconnect and voting age makes it so it doesn't affect much of the voting population
Have we seen any prominent politicians base a campaign off of education?
Don't assume it can't get worse
i'm saying we might be at the peak of crisis
Press F to pay respects for 2020
our year especially
we basically are
We're in an educational crisis atm if you ask me
i believe there will be significant progress in our lifetimes
Slam CB's instead
in the past few decades college has been becoming more important so i get that the system is far from perfect right now
Don't
im going to slam my head through a wall
<@503787499605458954> do that shit
i don't think education will not change
Where our politicians at
Since it's been so fucky for us
i hope so
Do you guys think our generation will end up reforming education?
even if SAT was not nationalized they should at least nationalize AP
B o i
and that
N a t i o n a l i z e  C o l l e g e B o a r d
i agree with that
F u n d  s t a t e  s c h o o l s  m o r e
there will continue to be a problem with student debt but people will always point and say "financial aid is an option and here are all these colleges that give aid to majority of students"
college has become a necessity
i don't see it popping anytime soon on its own
no i don't think it's a bubble
especially because it also owns AP which doesn't have a competitor in the US (IB is a weak presence)
Do you think there's a bubble for college
college board is a monopoly
there are even many universities that are government funded
i think things like collegeboard should be nationalized
i mean what else can you expect from a private company
college has become a ploy for capitalism and collegeboard is just feeding off of it
$$$
They want all that
Fuck CollegeBoard
i
and it
but it was like three way
but there was this one table
i can't find the image rn
its just reading COMPLEX ASS TABLES LIKE
it doesn't
ACT essay is wack but like its super easy to get a good score and it has a science section
science on ACT doesn't exactly measure science knowledge
SAT essay is bullshit and doesn't include a science section
is it that different from ACT?
also the SAT is worth shit and doesn't measure Anything
i can write an entire essay on exactly why collegeboard is disgusting and manipulative
**:bar_chart: did you take the ACT or SAT?**
/poll "did you take the ACT or SAT?" "ACT" "SAT"
thats what happened
it exists
Oh oof what happened?
the time of night where i get Pissed Off at collegeboard for profiting off of our S U FF E R I N G
Blaze it
its that time of night guys
9:20pm
ah
_haven't i suffered enough_
oh
financial aid stuff
css?
I agree
this is Dumb
does CSS costs MONEY
w h y the FUCK
thank
Good luck
Ok
i mean the roads are cleared so
If that happens, be sure to email sooner rather than later
Good point
They get it
Cuz they live in the area too
You could ask to reschedule?
Have your parents drive you? Snow tires?
fuck i have an interview tomorrow
You guys think the ice clears away by Wednesday? I have an interview in Seattle.
Go get 'em!
me: writing my honors program application
me: god im so Smart why wouldn't they want me
I was gonna ask that too
Idk tbh
do we just click "update" and then wait a few days for it to update before sending it off or can we send it now with "hold for grades"?
I think just for Common App,
 and then the schools not on it (e.g. UW, WSU, etc.)
do we request it from parchment for every single school?
i am completely lost as to how to do the mid year report
When's the deadline to request a mid-year report?
love ya guys. y'all are the best
we won't forget you Gene
Crippling insecurities.
Don't mind them.
dw how can we forget you
Yes but like, don't forget meeee is all I'm saying
we Have to come home
we have no where to live
Thank you
As long as you guys come back for me when y'all visit, I'll take your word for it
relax you'll get in somewhere and wherever you go is where you're supposed to be
I really don't wanna go to WSU tho lol
oh then you're good
I might apply to something else that doesn't require supplementals
WSU
Idk if UW is considered a safety, but that too
did you apply to safeties
Also: congrats to everyone who applied to the UCs
The number of applicants went down this year for the first time in 15 years apparently. There's supposedly a smaller pool. I wish y'all luck.
Let's just hope USC or NYU Tisch accepts my sorry ass, and I'll just be happy about not being broke if they don't
Yeah, I think I'm just so caught up with wanting to have a choice, but if I already know the decision if I'm gonna make if I have a choice, no point in it
it seems like USC is your priority and you should focus on the colleges you would actually consider going to
if you don't feel like it's worth applying, then don't. Honestly, I wouldn't waste my time if it's not important to you and you wouldn't care if you got in or got rejected.
I should really just be working on my USC transfer app for next year let's be real lol
My family wouldn't even be disappointed cuz I didn't even tell them
Like, I wanted another school, cuz like I felt I should be applying to more than 6, but I should really be looking for another safety than another match/reach, right?
I'm not crazy if I just don't apply to UMich right now, right? As much as I love their campus, and as much as I appreciate my legacy status, I haven't started supplementals cuz I realized I really don't care and wouldn't go even if excepted cuz they're expensive for a state school, and I don't feel like I'd get in if I crammed a random app right now cuz they're competitive, and I'm tired
Ok, so I'm making a random-ass decision, so I need someone to verify it's not a terrible decision so I'm not overwhelmed with regret
I need to do that
no essay, ez
true
Ikr?
that was such a joy to fill out
Oh sorry David
why can all college admissions not be as easy as WSU
David Kim
what's up?
wat
I should probably ask David
Everything else went in one ear and out the other
She said something any research
Yeah
oh structured academic controversy?
Nothing unmanageable
what
So I have English (might do that first to ease myself into productivity)
Then I have the history stuff. I'll probably do that on and off.
I have a couple college essays I wanna bs/draft out tonight. Deadline is tomorrow night.
And idk what's going on in TOK but apparently we have something there
Bless up one pager isn't due tomorrow
Uh lemme check something
how much more do you have to do?
aw _Gene_
I slept from 1:30-5:30 last night cuz I tried to get up to do homework, so I'm starting to feel that
Have some things to do
yeet
I just woke up from another accidental nap
what's up?
But I kinda regret that sooo idk
It that doesn't work, I might try what I did last night
I'm gonna get myself some tea or something
I'm not feeling great right now and I'm not 100% sure what to do
I'm not sure
you ok? <@!258094439636008971>
Also my head and is spinny hurty and tired
Nice
also applied to wsu
it‚Äôs f i n e you were doing good things
I'm sorry
i got in
i didn‚Äôt
you gave me a heart attack bc i was like AJDKAHF DID I FORGET TO APPLY
I should do that
Oh
They offer guaranteed acceptance if your stats are high enough
@everyone reminder: if you care about it, WSU deadline is today and tales about 30 minutes to do
it's tomorrow night tho right
thanks i hope there is actually a correlation lmao
good luck
ü§î
now i need to do my physics ia experiment that's due tomorrow lulz
!
gahhhhhh i'm done with college interviews
awesome. thanks
thank you
they'll either set you up with a new alumni interviewer or waive your interview
ill email them sometime today or tomorrow then
ah alright
no the admissions office isn't in cahoots with the individual interviewers and won't check on them for you
i kinda wanna give her the benefit of the doubt cuz maybe my emails got filtered out
hm, alright, that's fair
"hey, i was scheduling with her, and i stopped hearing back. i just wanted to check if everything is alright?"
say that you gave them your availability and followed up twice but they haven't responded in over a week
idk
cuz like
what do i tell them?
yeah that's enough time to tell admissions office that she didn't schedule your interview
a little over a week ago
when was the last time she wrote to you
they sent me a list of their availability and i told them "yeah, this works. when did yo have time this day and where did you wanna meet"? i've followed up twice and she still hasn't responded. this is the professional equivalent of triple texting. this day in question was yesterday
so just send them another email either telling them your updated availability like I did, or simply ask if those times will still work for them
i sent them my available times and they didn't respond until i sent them a list of updated times
that happened to me with one of mine
yeah
like while you're scheduling the interview?
stopped responding to my emails?
so what should i do if my interviewer just like
Remember how excited we were when we first got college emails, and even Harvard sent us one our sophomore year on the first or second day, and we all thought there was hope in our lives?
I'm sure it's not the norm to read them, so I guess we'll all be screwed together
That was a study from wsj btw
I just mark everything as read
I literally never read emails unless the subject pertains to me specifically or a scholarship offer
lol what
I wish we knew about this before Daniel did his FOA on college emails so he could include it
I shouldn't get rejected over this
Not my fault if your email is stuck in a dog pile under the other emails
Oops
So
I don't
whew
oh i open all my emails
Brb, gonna go dig for every email USC and NYU have ever sent me and open them
This is honestly kinda dumb
like if i switch browsers and computers all that data is not transferrable
That's how
$ $ $
how do they track that though
rip i'm not getting into anywhere then
This is intense
thanks lol
i hope it works out for you too tho
i'm sorry
F
slight rip but I'm very hopeful on that one
but I suspect it's 'cause they're waiting on national merit results
I got deferred from northeastern
oof
He's a sophomore and he still gets them
can we block them
lol
They don't ever go away
Bad news, fam
good luck!
i have upenn tomorrow and then i'm freeeee
and then upenn sometime later
i have brown tomorrow D:
yay go helen!
go helen go!!
big congrat
n i c e
Only one left to go!
Yeet I finished my college interviews for the day
NYU did something similar to me
Rip in peace
lol
like a minute ago, after me doing literally nothing, they sent me another email that was like "oh your application is complete thank u we look forward to reviewing"
I meant to email the admissions office last night but then I forgot
and I was like ????????????
when American sent me an email like your application is incomplete where's your common app
so yesterday I almost had a heart attack
lmao
<@193229269076279298>
no u
okay i deserved that
<@460689096646590465> being around you shortens my life span
get that sweet sweet hit of dopamine
c r o n c h
munch
<@460689096646590465> just what I needed
fried chicken shortens your life span
do it
biology of domestic birds
I forgot what this was in reference to when I saw the notification, and I got confused
fried chicken specifically
they look like a snack
_because chicks are cute_
w h y  a m  i  l o o k i n g  a t  t h i s  s c h o o l
valid
update:
this is the most wisconsin thing i've ever seen, and i don't know how to feel about this
me: ima look for more schools to apply to
*checks uw-madison*
uw-madison:
L
But you already got accepted before you had to write more apps, right?
Every one except for me
I really hope so, but I'm just scared of the consequences if I'm not
Gene you're going to be fine
I feel like almost everyone I know ended up applying to more schools than me, and I'm gonna end up with fat rejeccs from most of mine and regret not applying to more
I've been the "this is fine" dog comic for the entire process, and now I'm terrified I'm gonna get my ass rejected everywhere
I got mine at 9:21 this morning
or maybe your mailbox
check your portal?
yo what
this morning
I haven't seen any emails yet and it's making me nervous
When did you get that
Acceptance rate is gonna be  h e l l  this year
"Your application is still being considered for approximately 6,000 additional first-year offers of admission."
I saw this, and now I'm extremely uncomfortable.
Waiting for all these schools to reject my ass cuz everything I applied to was probably a reach ayyy
Heh
only two more months!
I guess it doesn't matter
So
But I'm just an impatient fuck
I'm kinda starting to wish I applied early somewhere cuz I haven't heard back from any school yet so F
yeah :)
At least there's still hope
It's ok
L
Time to start working on that  t r a n s f e r  a p p
rip
That's like half of what it was last year
damn
Someone on Reddit said they think their acceptance rate is gonna be lower than 7% this year wtf
lol no scholarships for me either
There's no way I was one of their 1,000 best applicants lol
I'm not surprised
It's ok
f
F
The wait continues
such a cool school
their co-op program looks so gooooood
which is üòç
well northeastern also has co-op
lol
meeeeeeee
laughs in 0 decisions
cuz you guys are great people and hardworking individuals
go where makes you happy
fam, i will always be proud of all of y'all
so it's a valid argument
someone my mom knows chose northeastern for cs over uiuc because of location
and idk if you value that as much lol
but, I'm proud of u
like I'd prob pick a shittier school in a more interesting place
but I'm saying if I was going into cs I prob wouldn't go for that reason
yea exactly I didn't apply
i mean cs is the only really hot major in uiuc so you'd have less motivation to go there
middle of nowhere campuses have their perks
sadness
yeah that's the caveat...
it's like in the middle of nowhere though rip
oh, wow, nice!
so it's a luxurious backup lol
after stanford harvard mit cmu which all tie for 1 technically
yep it's ranked 5 for cs in the nation
I wouldn't go to uiuc for petty reasons
oh cool
really
that's ok i got uiuc comp sci which i would choose over gtech anyday
nah don't be
same reason tgall didn't get into michigan
im sorry
lol
lol r i p
oof
oh
oh nice
i hope this gets buried in the chat but i think i got deferred because i overqualified
but?
oh cool
aayushi got into gtech which i found out from katya
?
tea?
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
actually i know i didn't lose but that's a separate discussion
i can't lose to aayushi
might be interesting to see if i get in tho
oh alright
also idk i might just let gtech drop
letter of continued interest
will deal with everything this weekend
loci?
wow that grammar
i still need to do that for mit
whatever deferral's not the end I'm sent in a loci already
me: well that was expected
college apps are just underwhelming in general
lol
opening my mit thing was like "wow this is so typical and will not effect me in any way whatsoever"
I was just stressed
like I dont mind at all
oh I'm fine
im sorry
the actual thing was far less climactic
lol I literally dreamed about opening my gtown letter like 3 or 4 sleeps in a row before I got it
L
it's cuz you feel like dying before you sleep, not cuz you wanna feel alive after
lol
you and i both know that's not why we're there to sleep
well you also feel rested afterwards
no wonder we love it
very true
for all intents and purposes you don't exist during the time
sleeping is basically temporary death
thank you
ill take your word for it
oka
i dont feel like i should be this anxious, cuz i literally can't get rejected tomorrow and probably won't hear anything, but i'm feeling it
do yourself a favor and ensure you sleep until noon
it wasn't even reasonable because I wasn't set on getting in and knew i would be fine if i didn't
literally never in my life have i felt so much anxiety for an extended period of time
oof im sorry
i was awake for 3 hours before my MIT decision and it was the worst time in my life
if you feel like you'll be anxious, do it
dolla dolla bills
im tempted to stay up late so i wake up at like noon
good point
honestly, at least it means im in
a box you say
what if the scholarship arrives in the form of literal stacks of bills
(package should arrive tomorrow via USPS tho, so if that rolls by before noon, look for a thin white box)
well
packages have been rolling out this week but we got fuck by
portal updates at noon
Ah
but only the big boi scholarships
tomorrow
scholarships
What usc thingy
Wait what
usc thingy
on what
also <@!503787499605458954> <@!340319804747415553> good luck to you guys tomorrow
well, i guess you could just check the mail after USPS rolls by your neighborhood if it doesnt work out
i could see if i could help you log in and stuff, you know? you did all the work, so you kinda deserve to know at this point
also <@!503787499605458954> did you want help with the portal?
yeah, UW-Madison is still open too
for RD
damn
Feb 1
is umich not due o.O
and then i misread
and i was like "sure, let's spend some extra time on it"
ah
yeah, but they wanted a portfolio for me
im considering just doing an app this weekend for UMich RD to ride legacy in
it's just common app tho
major rip
i forgot to apply to northeastern lol
F
.-.
good luck for that too!!!
supposed to within the next 5 days
no üò¶
they don't reject this round
have you found out northeastern?
and also probably getting rejected lol
Im scared
oooooh good luck!!!
oh
not admission
only for scholarships
from their website: "USC no longer conducts on- or off-campus admission interviews."
faster than the USPS truck will arrive at my neighborhood
portal updates tomorrow for USC at noon
yeah
they do??
so many of these are invitations to fly down
cuz they do interviews for their big boi scholarships
<@!503787499605458954> do you want me to see if i can help?
<@!472541429130854421> they accept the big bois first and deal with the plebz like me later
isn't it both
why do they send out scholarships before acceptance letters?
it says I don't have an account w my email even tho I got their email saying here's your login with your email
i can see if i can do anything about it
what happened?
F
im probably not getting one anyways
dude my usc portal never worked
oh shit
this is their tracking boi
USC's sending out scholarships this week
my family has prime
solves all your problems
this isn't an order
just get amazon prime
just gonna have to do the big thumb twiddle
but im still not happy about this
fine
ok
well
it's a thing we read about this for cuegis last year in business
when people aren't willing to pay for amazon's priority shipping and  usps takes too long, etc
and actually they get a lot of complaints over shipping they can't control
esp for lazy cross-country deliveries
what about colorado and like the big texas cities?
like yeah they do rely on ups and usps
you know?
man, gotta drive out the competition?
in a lot of cases anyway
well
oh
amazon has their own delivery system
there's amazon doing amazon things?
where like
in the PNW
do they not have a thing
but like
^
for the midwest parts land is cheaper so maybe they have lots of centers there
w y o m i n g ? ? ?
i think they're probably just proximity to a large shipping center???
so much of this makes so little sense, and it's making me  u n c o m f o r t
to complain about this USPS shipping map
can i take a moment here
=.=

me waiting on college decisions:
No problem. Good luck!
aight thanks
You could ask the counselors
I think you have to email, but I could be wrong
app updates and additional accomplishments n shit through the common app
is there a way to send like
Oh my gosh, I didn't even notice that. Hahaha
the sent from my iphone really sets the tone
The biggest of moods
i have come to the conclusion that interviews are generally chill
I have five interviews within a week fml
They're probably very flexible with time
F just let them know and ask for a different time
HARVARD CONTACTED ME FOR AN INTERVIEW TOMORROW BUT I H A VE W OR K
AJSKLF:JDSK:LFLDSFDKSI
Nice!

<@!340319804747415553> where does USC send people their ID numbers?

USC: we want your social security number
me: k, i'll fill out this form
USC: we want your USC ID
me: wait, did you give me one
USC: fill out the god damn form

._.
laughs in had a male stanford doctor for interviewer
"i'm too lazy to"
and she was like "yeah duke tried to get me to talk to children"
ngl i think generally female interviewers are easier to talk to than male interviewers, especially in stem fields
i was talking to susan
recent children
wow
two graduated just last year and one graduated two years ago
i've had a biochemist, an aerospace engineer and a program manager/programmer at microsoft interview me
I'm relevant
oh yeah if you have relevant and good work bring it if you feel like
Yo that's p cool
lolol it‚Äôs a good sign when you can geek out with your interviewer
he was like hey my friend teaches this
I brought work samples
we geeked out about deca
he was also super cool though
yeah I was like p intimidated
damn
my interviewer was a financial analyst for the gates foundation
got em
me: hey i‚Äôm emily did you know i‚Äôm a writer
solid
my interviewer had short blue hair and she was super cool and we talked about fandoms
they WILL judge you, first impressions are important, just put in a bit of effort and you should be fine though
business casual
Brother: Oh, you're fine. Just don't wear jeans, sweatpants, a t-shirt, a hoodie, or running shoes.
Me: shit shit shit brb running to a store
Brother: ???
You don't need super dressy clothes, least of all a suit. The point of the interview is for the person to get to know you, so wear something you would usually wear. Just make sure it's neat and clean.
^^^
Like casual clothes but like something you know you look good in
I went like a semi formal casual
What do you wear at an admission interview? Semi-formal? Cuz my interview offer said explicitly to wear casual clothes, and I was caught a bit off-guard, cuz I was expecting to wear a suit or something.

they dont want us to have the monies
why does it cost money to get financial aid this is so stupid
why financial aid so hard
i feel like they're either gonna charge us of they have a fat contract for it
thanks collegeboard
oh awesome
i havent done it yet tho, so dont quote me
and can give financial aid accordingly
that way colleges know how broke/ballin' your family is
collegeboard sends tax returns to colleges for you
what the living fluff is IDOC and why
<333 gotta love the money
Congrats!!! That's a lot of money haha
‚ù§
thank
hey congrats!
and that's good!
<3
thanks i‚Äôm less poor now :‚Äô)
grats on scholarship :)
money is money, bitch :P
n i c e
ofc it‚Äôs only for portland but still
u of portland awarded me the president‚Äôs scholarship?? $100,000 divided over four years????
So I have a bunch of hope for you guys
A lot of it is the passion and personal motivation, which all of y'all have tons of
surprise
and then they ended up being really good at what they liked
i feel like successful people were often like fuck school im gonna do what i want and what i like instead
There's hope for us all
The people who are good at school are a dime a dozen based on college apps lmao. Not too surprised the real geniuses are the ones who suck at it
uwu
True true
Add another to the list of "people who reassure you that you can be successful even when school sucks"
honestly its no coinky dink that the smartest people suck at school
yeah
Really?
Historical fiction
you know hawking sucked at school
Oh, that's super interesting
apparently its based on the book his ex wife wrote. she studied English in college and wrote a bunch of books
It's kinda crazy to think that Hawking's gone tbb
s  ad
That movie
Ohhhh
its the steven hawking movie
I haven't seen this
Oh no!
his wife leaves him its so sad
I'm sorry
Oh
its so Sad
See? You're doing great
Good job getting your mind off of it
im in a Mood
i just watched theory of everything
ya yeet
Is everything alright?
Accumulating over the months
It's full of puppies who want to love and support you
Go to the puppers channel
If you ever think it won't
It will be ok
big sad
ye a h
You worked hard on your college app process. It'll all work out
You will be f i n e
N O
Happens all the time. They used to it
i'll just Die i guess
It's ok. Just order rush shipping. Colleges are used to receiving scores late
im so dead
its been 12 days
i forgot to send in my scores for rochester
Me: Woah, WSU has a lot of majors. Not bad for a safety.
*Five minutes later*
Me: WSU doesn't have enough majors everything here is boring and based around agriculture wtf
also thanks <@!503787499605458954>
i know i am tho
i think some people here are going and some people arent
I'm pretty sure I've already paid
w a s
yea, that was the plan
bc if y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt going i‚Äôm gonna be sad
are we all going to the all night grad party
june 13
not soon enough
I think the 13th
what day is graduation?
thanks
nope
UW doesn't need CSS, right? Internet seems to say they don't, but I wanna be like super sure
Rip
Instead of US
I think it was Helen when she ended up typing "UW" instead of something else
i just remember someone did something similar the other day
yeah, im ok
u ok?
my subconscious is determined to destroy me
i tried to type "USB" and typed "USC" on accident
Sorry, fam. I'm incompetent and paranoid. I would think y'all would know that by now.
Google gave me some contradictory stuff
ü§î
Google is a valuable resource
Wasfa is for if you‚Äôre an undocumented student
cuz i know most schools require fafsa and css regardless of whether you can get aid or not
although is it required?
i dont think i'm getting need-based financial aid
i think if you want financial aid it's in your best interest to do it
do we have to do it then?
it's washington state specific
oh
wat
what is wasfa
is WASFA required by UW? there's a deadline for it on their website, but i have no idea what it is
my queen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
congratulation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Congrats emily!
‚ù§
yep it‚Äôs portland! thanks guys!
B i g  c o n g r a t
Ayyyy niiiiiiice!
nice
looks like u of portland
which school?
omg congrats!!
Gratssss
t h a n k
Congratulations!!!
crisis averted: gov just takes ~5 days to process fafsa in case anyone else was wondering
like i did fafsa but none of my schools seem to have it yet
does anyone know how to actually submit financials?
gucci ty
üëå
how that?
Thank you for this reminder! I received and checked the applicant portal today and discovered that my artistic review had not been received. I had previously submitted my artistic review through SlideRoom prior to the deadline without my NYU ID number, as I did not have it at the time and the SlideRoom application said I could submit my application without my NYU ID number if I had not received it yet.

Unfortunately, I can no longer edit my application in SlideRoom to add my NYU ID number. Is there anything I should do to ensure that my artistic review is properly matched with my application, or is my SlideRoom's connection to my Common Application enough?

Thank you!

-Gene Wang
split it into two
Seems a little dense
should i split it into two paragraphs?
hey, guys. how does this email look? is it too stiff or does it end too abruptly? is it weird to thank them twice?

fast question: so when i submit fafsa, do i have to add anything to common app or email my colleges or anything? or do they just have once i've submitted it from the gov website?
this is the second college that's told me "yo, we didn't get yo shit"
wtf nyu doesn't have my portfolio apparently according to their portal. my stress levels just went from like 0 to 100 really fast
i imagine it's similar
idk if other schools do that but like
cuz i know their acceptance letters come in these small boxes and their rejections come in sad envelopes
if i get a box from USC, i'm fucking opening it
well, to be fair
funny
don‚Äôt open the box
hah
easy
don‚Äôt check your apps on your birthday
i have an irrational fear that i'm gonna receive a rejection on my brithday cuz it's in march lmao
'Prove the pieces, prove the thesis." -William Paananen
Until we have lived through college apps we do not have sufficient life experience to make good senior quotes
college apps weren't relevant enough to us at the time
Damn that would have made a great senior quote
that‚Äôs the same reason i don‚Äôt check my grades
That is so true
to put the stress at ease: schrodinger's cat applies to college apps. until you open your letter, you're both accepted and rejected, guys. don't even worry about it.
College apps have been such a huge part of my daily living that whenever I mean to type US my finger slips and I type UW instead
it's like a skyward addiction but you sit through pain for 3 hours at a time and have no control over the situation
try being a mariners fan
it‚Äôs stockholm syndrome
With skyward
It‚Äôs an abusive relationship
It‚Äôs not an addiction
But to clarify
I‚Äôm late
rip
my brother went to umich and roast him to this day about the midwest
i mean, i could live in the south if it weren't for the fucking weather and my parents pestering the decision i made for years
lmao rip
yeah no no southern twang for me please and thank you
.... got a bone to pick with w va?
but still
I wouldn't just die I'd kill myself
ok at least vanderbilt's not in west virginia
wrong state
wait
oh dear
I  B E L O O O O N N N G G
TO THE PLACE
TAKE ME HOME
COUNTRY ROADS
jk
what, can't live with the southern twang?
in the south
I would die
I could not
and then I realized it was in tennessee
lol I thought about vanderbilt
also it only needed 1 essay
it's a solid school
i applied to vanderbilt
rip
i only looked at it cuz it was the only ivy with a cool name. that's literally it.
i honestly spent some time considering vanderbilt too cuz i like its name.
that's when i realized i was on the verge of making some bad decisions.
i didn't apply tho so *shrugs*
it actually kinda makes sense tho. kinda wish more schools did it.
i think so
damn
oh really????
*dartmouth requires it
a surprising number of schools do
<@!460689096646590465> you don't know that. dartmouth takes letter of recs from peers.
it‚Äôs great i didn‚Äôt do ANYTHING
technicalities
sunday morn
love you guys though
how are y'all doin this fine saturday evening
my friends aren‚Äôt getting me into college
remember, guys:
check skyward less and check on your friends more instead
different approaches to fear. those who stare fear in the face vs those who run bc they have functional fight or flight systems
need to know vs. need for avoidance
it‚Äôs a problem that i‚Äôm not equipped to solve
I've talked about this w her before
opposite problems
<@503804933099880458> developed an addiction
rip cindy
like opening it gives me so much anxiety
oooof
ive checked skyward a lot less this year
it's so bad
i just don't check it
rip
over the years
of checking skyward
a legitimate phobia
I've developed
y'all
too many Ls to comprehend
i feel like skyward's been down a lot this year
emiiii D:
ooooof
oh rip
oh well
for film
i needed skyward
btw
shit
fuck skyward too
good
skyward is down too
if i can‚Äôt see it then it‚Äôs not real
so uh
but then series test
I had a B
same
i‚Äôm too scared to check
I think my math grade might actually be a B- rn
mood
lol emi
which would tank us further
bold of you to assume i‚Äôm not currently a B- student
we'd be fucked on the tests
granted I might end up that way anyways
not even that
B- students
we'd be like
if we made as many mistakes as she did
i only ask questions to save the silence like i didn‚Äôt actually need help. i was just too lazy to think about the problem
she's like "everyone's human!" but I mean
oh my gosh
dude I don't know anyone who likes her
lmao
someone took one for the team
good shit
ooooof
omg
but holy hellll
<@!167457958211354624>
we couldn't tell who said it
someone made the meme
"a monkey"
I SAW THE MEME
and someone straight up said
!!!!!!
and was like "what species am i?"
she was talking about why we didn't say anything about her mistakes
i don't even know this person, and i wanna yell at her
dude
I know we all say `fuck reinsch` but I'm still genuinely shocked that someone did
i ask questions in class but holy hellllll
i hate her
seriously
ok but
i can‚Äôt believe
sorry
i was taking one for the team and y‚Äôall watched me drown like that
im sorry
FUCK reinsch
I could tell
ok real quick i died in reinsch‚Äôs class when she grilled me
and I think it's dumb that people can take ap in fresh/soph but ib has to be all junior/senior
there are definitely better ways to organize the program to balance it a bit more
but like
i feel like IB actually embodies what education should kinda be about
I think the workload can be kinda ridiculous
m o a r
i just wish m o r w time
i quite enjoy IB and the learning we get out of it
i wish it could have been different, but i don't regret it
‚ÄúAP is just as hard‚Äù l i s t e n
i just hate collegeboard and AP
i don‚Äôt regret it
as much as I bitch about it
I don't actually regret doing ib
lol
AP is like walking through a road paved by college board while IB is struggling through the bushes, hacking down branches with machetes just to get to the same place
o o f
and then you asked a question and she like interrogated you about it
when she was like why did none of you ask questions
rest in peace
btw I'm salty af at reinsch for yesterday
NOT KHAN ACAD
what metaphor
oh nooooo
<@!503787499605458954> did you hear my metaphor in math
wait wtf
the khan academy thing is our fault
we couldn't give them enough money and they had to cave into the powers to survive
i‚Äôm still mad about AP
I was shooketh for a sec
ok I knew about that
we‚Äôve been falling for collegeboard‚Äôs tricks and schemes for far too long
yea
so partnership
khan academy's SAT stuff is via collegeboard
or is it just the partnership
well
rest in peace khan academy
they bought it?
yeah
yeah
wait really???????
khan academy
the one we rely on
the power we trust the most
collegeboard has AP, PSAT, SAT, National Merit, and the worst of all
nickel and diming us for every we've got and giving nothing of note in return
*life is a game and collegeboard is EA enforcing microtransactions and shitty content
life is a game and collegeboard is the game master
if this isn't selling your soul to try to get into college, idk what is
they laugh at us
they taunt us, dangling scholarship money above our heads to unreachable extents
not to mention the ability to relay anything they want to colleges
our PSAT and SAT scores
collegeboard has all our information. our family, our ssn, our annual income, our parents degrees and education
i feel like if collegeboard was ever under threat, it would just hold our social security numbers hostage against us
when in fact it controls everything
collegeboard is like the authoritarian power we‚Äôre not supposed to know exists
i feel the oof as well.
collegeboard is so sketch
yeah you go dad
i‚Äôm not upset about that bc i hate collegeboard and this is their fault so
my dad isn‚Äôt helping me fill out css until he finds out where all the information goes bc he thinks it‚Äôs sketch
lmao kk thanks
Sorry I'm not at computer but here's what the internet has to say
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/focused-inbox-for-outlook-f445ad7f-02f4-4294-a82e-71d8964e3978
how do you do that?
Just make sure to turn off focused inbox to make it easier
It worked fine for me
lmao, outlook's email sorting algorithm will probably be the end of me in a week or two
yep email
also, to the people who've done interviews, how do you get notified? via email? cuz i feel like outlook is just gonna auto-shift requests into the pile lmao
i just realized
UW better accept my ass at this point
cuz i've only applied to 4 other school, all of which have under 20% acceptance rates lol
although i just accidentally sent them my fafsa
That's fair
i dont think i would have gone to northeastern over uw anyways tbh
I didn't even get around to looking at the UT application
there weren't even essays for northeastern tho lmao
Dw I missed the UT deadline by 7 days
welp, rip i guess
oops apparently northeastern's deadline was the 1st
*filling out CSS*
k
*collegeboard wants more info out of you*
ok fine you've already harvested my soul
***collegeboard wants your social security number***
......................
np! good luck! until then, try not to stress too much about it. not much you can do
Thanks for the help! I'm sure Fowler will know about it
that's what's offered to us for the bio IA. idk if you have access to it, but hey, it means skyline at least has it
<@!472541429130854421>
(not that i'm doing my bio IA right lol)
But a bendy ruler is still close to a normal one
fam, i'm literally using my bendy ruler for my bio IA
Yeah I looked them up but if they aren't good...
it's a decent Plan C
idk if it's as good but like
worst case scenario, i'm sure there are apps on your phone that can do the same job
Knowing the school has this might have saved my IA lmao
yeah, np
i haven't used it, but it was offered for the bio IA
Ok wow thanks so much
!!!!
:o
i think it's a decibel meter
If you don't know it's ok lol I'll ask Fowler about it
lemme check what they're called
What is it called?
uh
like a
Oh wow
yeah
it was offered to us for our bio IAs
Seriously???
they do
Have no idea if the school owns a scientific instrument to record the volume of a sound
If I can convince myself to so it, I'm asking Fowler for tuning forks on monday
cuz i'm p sure you can get air pipes at home depot or something
that you don't already have
what do you need access too?
The manipulated variable is the width of the tube
Something about sound resonance in closed end air pipes
what's your topic for physics?
if it helps you feel any better, the final IA is a second-semester grade. don't feel the need to do 11/10 on it
Physics IA data due next Thursday but I don't have any of it or a means of acquiring it
A bunch of IAs
wanna talk about it?
i'm sorry
College apps are over but still can't relax :'(
Rip in peace guys
Gee, it's almost like it's not for the gov and instead for schools to figure out if you have enough money for tuition
sigh
my dad bitched the entire time how the gov sucks and there's no way we'd get aid anyway etc etc
<@!472541429130854421> same
Did they do it?
Oof
What kind of lunacy is this
I had to persuade my parents that we should fill out FAFSA and CSS at all
fat mood
Has anyone else ever had a dream in which you didn't get into some of the schools they applied to, got deferred from some others, but hey you got accepted into this one really good school, so you're set?
But then you wake up and realize you didn't even apply to that school and you can't get deferred from those places cuz you did regular decision?
i'm just putting no for now. i can always register later i think
I have no idea
oh woah
when doing fafsa, do i have to select "yes" when it offers to register me for the draft if i'm not 18 yet?
ok thanks
It's just for login reasons
Nah probably not
i don't want colleges to see my fafsa account under "IHazAStupid"
like do colleges see it?
does the username we put into fafsa matter?
ok, so this might be dumb but like
college essay speedrun
actually i had time yesterday but i was like hhhhh it‚Äôs not due until 1/15 so
i got a 250 word thing for Reed left and then i‚Äôm freeeeee
Oh hey look that's like twice the colleges I applied to. Rip lol
Something something UPenn? :p
yeet yay
(ignore the straggler due on 1/5)
Yay!
good luck to the rest of y'all. you got this.
finally
guess who's done ayyy (except northeastern and wsu maybe or something else with a later deadline but those dont count)
NYU: this should be ~250 words
me: oh that's cool and flexible *writes essay*
NYU: lol jk you hard limit of 1500 characters
me: wait what but that has nothing to do with wor--
NYU: SUCK IT
i love how nyu doesnt care if my last name is on my app or not lol
oh well. i caught it this time around. it'll all be fine and dandy
gosh golly am i smart lol
but instead i panicked and set a screenshot
turns out i could've just zipped my creative sample for usc into a folder
me trying to do a final proofreading while super dizzy: hahahah yeah those are words you should be fine i see no tipoes
me knowing that i'm about to submit my apps: fren, are you high what focus
brb gonna become a plumber, make 100k a year, learn some basic investing at BC, get rich off of stocks, donate S1 mil, and then go to harvard
plus peer pressure and additional stress bc people you know are getting into really good schools, and chances are you've read/heard a lot about a specific program/aspect/part of the school's culture that you really like
because no matter what maners's shitty tok articles say what school you go into does matter and will affect your career and that's just facts
but then immediately go back to stressing over you expected thicc rejecc
do you guys ever stop and think about "yo, lowkey, why am i so stressed about getting into a particular school? it's still a school, and i'm still going to do school things. sure, college life is cool and all, but i can go to like any school for that."
less effort = better chance
so
but simplicity is often a form of innovation
as soon as it becomes a story you become a cheap imitation
this only works if you're the first person to think of it
and then there's the dude who answered "what's the biggest problem society faces today" by copy/pasting "BLACK LIVES MATTER" until they reached the word limit
my brother told me someone got into a super good college (i think stanford) by answering the prompt "if you could do anything, what would it be," and she said "i'd want the ability to write in invisible ink," put in two blank pages, and at the end asked, "did you get that?"
certainly didn't work for me
effort has a negative trend in general
if you have a 1600/36/4.0 and also great non-academic life then that's ideal
i'm just kidding with all this
because the amount of effort and type of personality required to acquire a 1600/36/4.0 negatively impacts your social status, extracurriculars, and desire to have a life
and then your GPA and scores have a negative correlation as you near the top of the spectrum
lmao then the other is legacy status
i'm sure there are ways to quantify
ü§î
ethnicity isnt numerical
the other trend is whether or not you're of an interesting ethnicity
no.... inverse SQUARED
0.82
only thing with a strong trend is how much money your parents have donated to the school
inverse relationship lol
-0.12 pearson's correlation coefficient r
"how does the  c r o n c h  rate affect quality of applications and chance of acceptances..."
my EE is is literally titled "i do enjoy me some  c r o n c h"
that's the title of my EE
once again deciding to apply to some schools last minute
that's not in response to david's comment
i do enjoy me some  c r o n c h
Yikes
Ladies and gentlemen, it‚Äôs crunch time
im actually offended they would ask me that
i dont even know how to tell my family
everything is living hell holy shit
i dont even have a similar essay to copy/paste holy shit
now i get to have an ass-roasting session
i was actually feeling good about this app and about to submit
i really didnt need this in my life
my family's gonna be so pissed
Harvard and one other had the exact same question with the same word limit so I just Ctrl+c
It surprised me too
thanks for pulling this shit on me. guess who's  spending new year's writing an unexpected essay
but holy shit
tru i guess. ill go through and proofread
It's pretty important
Isn't it the only activity list the college gets?
how important do you guys think the common app description of activities is? or is it more of just seeing that you actually have shit?
just upload a meme lol
this is what photoshop is for
on the gtown app they were like if you feel like it add a pic of yourself
I feel like they do judge you somewhat
or maybe to make IDs like a normal school who the hell knows
idk actually. probably for the portal or something so a picture of you stares into your soul every time you refresh
why do they do that
what is this? the 1950s? i'm disappointed
apparently how attractive i am is a requirement smh
guys, looks like im not getting into NYU
same except i have negative brain cells left
i have 2.5 applications left and no brain cells left
Me too, especially since I'm applying to less schools than most people
You're not the only one
am i the only one who periodically hits a road block where the brain stops and goes ‚Äúwhat if you don‚Äôt get in‚Äù and then continues functioning as if it didn‚Äôt just glitch
ive emerged from sad boi hours and have reached big fat headache hours, where you always have a headache, regardless if you just woke up or pulled an all nighter
if i somehow still got into USC for interactive entertainment, i think i'd be willing to blend up all of my rejection letters from others schools into a smoothie and slorp them down lmao
now that im almost done, im starting to realize how cookie cutter and boring my essays are
i guess it's just a me thing then
mostly i just think they're cute
do you guys ever just look at small kids but like instead of "wow, kids are cute," it's like "holy shit you're and that means you still have to go through all this shit i'm so sorry that you have to exist"?
this is college natural selection: it's imploding itself into oblivion
well that‚Äôs sad for harvard
negative acceptance rate
no one's getting into harvard
: (
now he has to the the TOEFL too
international students have it rougher
he Is from australia
nah, fam
maybe he moved oceans
is he first gen tho?
pull the first gen card?
smh doesnt matter no legacy status
let‚Äôs hope marlin‚Äôs a rich single dad
AO dont care for the sob story
just for the kiddos they can exploit for money
single clownfish child that‚Äôs rare
sets him apart too
well the fact that all his siblings died kinda makes less competition
there are so many clown fish
he adds no diversity to harvard's fish class of 2023
üò¶
cuz someone else has a third business
that's too bad
you don‚Äôt know that
but i don't see him starting up a charity and running two businesses now, do i?
he has connections with ellen degeneres
nah fam fat reject cuz acceptance rates
he saw the world outside of the sea the kid‚Äôs harvard bound
he's still gonna feel like it's comparatively uneventful, he can't express himself properly, and like he's not going to get into college
don't blame you
is it bad that my first thoughts when watching finding nemo is ‚Äúnemo‚Äôs gonna have a lot to write about for his personal essay‚Äù
Thanks
sleep  well
I can feel my brain fusing into my skull. I'm going to bed. G'night, fam.
yep
you guys ever have to stop wonder if philadelphia is the city or the state?
2012-2018
how long did thanos sit
ive been sitting in this chair in front of my laptop longer than thanos sat in his
if you have time do something that's not sitting in front of a screen
maybe play a video game
i just wanna sleep
oh yeah i revamped an entire app yesterday
i'm fixing stuff for him
first-draft gene was dumb
but like
im editing
nah, fam
are you doing the thing where you're just adding more colleges until you run out of time
ik i dont
who tf knows
how many more left?
but i just pulled an all nighter and have two more days of apps to go
same
wishful thinking
lol i thought yesterday was my last day of apps
brother: yo, this is your best app so far. nice
me: *blinks* i thought it was my worst and just finessed it.
brother: nah, make a few changes and elaborate on a few things and it should be good
**later**
me: i... don't know how to elaborate on this... i'm not even sure what i tried to do here or what i was talking about
NYU: why NYU?
me: i really like this one department and here's why
me: oh hey, there are more essays i did see
NYU: why this department?
me: oop
update: things are gonna be alright. i have less work than i thought in another facet of my app. i have time. i'm almost done. life's moving forward.
NYU: fuck you, bitch
me: wait, is that 5 supplementals that i didn't know about, some of which i already addressed in another essay?
NYU's website: hey there motherfucker. you see this small font on an obscure part of me?
me: sweet. im done with my NYU app. everyone's pissed at me for working so much. let's just check NYU's website one last time.
well fuck my life
fair enough
"I will immerse myself" vs "I would love to get involved with this activity/organization"
depends on what specifically I'm talking about
i don't think it matters too much, but i'm just curious, cuz i feel like it's an interesting reflection of our different approaches
just curious, when you guys talk about doing things at a college, do you guys use "i will" or "i would"?
No problem
that checks out. thanks
"further" might be it. lemme check
I would say "help further my study"
i mean it is, but like there just doesn't seem to be something stronger, ya know?
i would suggest something along the lines of "support" but i don't think that's what you're getting at
hm
the resources at [school] will help _____ my study of [subject of study]
context?
is there a word for "augment" that suggests a more direct/primary influence?
it would have never caught on
i feel like people would have burned common app the moment they saw it if it used comic sans
comic sans is designed for creativity
valid but also i would be a lot happier if everything was written in comic sans
and writing unique personal statements to every college
imagine having to mail stuff to every college via snail mail
it's doing its best
its causing me pain
be nice to common app. it's supposed to save us time, and it's doing its best
common application's logo is written in an increasingly menacing font
oh, i see. so like an intended course of action. gotchya thanks
la la la rigor, intellectual growth, confident that i can rise to the challenge and exceed expectations
i always end with like
oh
anyone have any tips for concluding a "why this school" essay?
woohoo!
idc at this point i've applied to my most important colleges
virginia woolf was fluffy as hell but here we are
you're a great writer. anyone who reads your apps and says otherwise needs to remember that they're editing your essays to help you refine your ideas, not decide whether you're worth admitting.
and if they say that about the final product, fuck them, cuz you invested time into your work
honestly, while i do see the concern there, it's usually an indication that you have a lot to say and express. hell, throw TTL at anyone who says that. sure, maybe you have to edit or refine your writing when you have to do stuff with word limits, but it's not a bad default writing style to have for someone like you (considering you do a fair amount of fiction and analytical articles)
"this is too fluffy" weLL thATs hoW i taLK anD WRiTe
fluffy is often used with a negative connotation in terms of my writing
thanks
if anything, interviews for an applicant like you are sprinkles: it's super awesome to get to meet you in person cuz it affirms everything they could deduce and you're a likeable person. however, they already knew that there was a bunch of fluffy cake beneath the sprinkles.
and tbh, i think you actually have p decent stuff "on paper" as well actually
You pretty much devote all your time to school
your competition is literally a bunch of rando high schoolers
I don't think anyone can during High School
i do so much better at interviews people generally like me better in person
i don't look so hot on paper
you can definitely get into an out-of-state school tho. just gotta apply to several of them. i imagine there are enough admission officers with enough brain cells to realize the potential you have that you have a good shot. just gotta convince a school to take a chance on you
o o f
my longest fucking sigh
me: i want to study out of state
my extended family: LMAO you better pray
after three days i finally found the words to finish Brown's application
thank you. and yeah, i'm trying my best. i can't really blame anyone for this. i'm just here.
if i find the will to edit these essays, which i can probably do in a couple hours if it weren't such a mental block, i can be done for good
1. college application writing is a whole different genre of writing and nobody prepared us enough for this
2. rewarding is subjective do what matters to you
3. you are doing your B E S T
4. adults and technology am i right
5. nothing ever goes as well as you imagined
6. procrastinating isn't a baseless habit, it's a coping mechanism
i'm always hesitant to show my work to my family, so i just let them know i'm doing fine and then do the work. my brother is not the type of person i want academic or professional help from, but in this case, he's the help i need. it's like going to a doctor you're not comfortable with for a talk about a very personal health issue, but like the doctor's a really cool dude and someone you would normally enjoy the presence of
1. I'm not great at this style of writing. Writing about myself/my values is just hard for me. Persuasive writing is also difficult because my style of persuasion is more conversational. I'm a good writer, but I'm like a fish out of water with college apps, and it kinda shows.
2. I will be eternally judged for wanting to do game design cuz it's objectively a difficult (and usually unrewarding) career path.
3. People know I'm a pretty decent student and kinda expect better.
4. My brother, while he has good feedback, isn't great at commenting on essays because it doesn't seem to register with him that I... see all the comments at once? Like if I overuse a word, he highlights every instance of it, leaving progressively more frustrated comments as if I'm repeating a mistake despite not having had a chance to edit, so when he talks to me, he just gets pissed.
5. My vision for how I thought this process was going to go, how other people thought this was going to go, and how it actually went were very different realities. There's a huge dissonance that's frustrating to look at (or, for me, literally be a part of).
6. I'm just kinda lazy and enjoy procrastinating in general.
what is it with adults and making fun of your aspirations for higher education
so im just sitting here
it hurts to read the comments, cuz i feel like im being judged
but like
i have a bunch of really good edits on my essays, and if i make the edits, i'm like done
employers also have higher expectations if you went to an elite school
that is true
everyone thinks you're condescending if you say you went to harvard
people respect you as a human being if you went to say ucla or something
if a school has an acronym, it's usually a good, non-uber-elite school that people won't think you're a pretentious prick for attending
ucla is sounding pretty great
like any college
i think that's the point
i simultaneously respect and am envious of everyone who wears a sweatshirt from a college i know of
valid
anyone in a usc sweatshirt is automatically attractive fite me
maybe you have high standards
usc
cuz like
maybe i just don't have eyes
hey can i like trade lives with him
i have never seen a cute guy in real life
i saw a cute guy at the store today. he had a USC sweatshirt on
in the future i can give advice to kids like "here are my stats and activities. If you're like me, you can choose to either lay back and enjoy life a bit more than i did or try harder"
my only state school is UW cuz my parents are like "if we're shelling out, it better be for a good private school"
what if i do a horizontal sweep of state schools but get into none of my reaches
"you made it through 18 years with both kidneys healthy? fam, here's money, cuz we want you"
they should give scholarships in exchange for kidneys
why is school so expensive
a kidney is like a scholarship
sell a kidney and still be in debt but less in debt
i‚Äôm just gonna be in debt
places like princeton i cant go to even if i was to be accepted bc a year there is like 70000
going out of state was important to me yet my wisest college choice would be in state for every single reason
i‚Äôve been having trouble sleeping but instead of using that time to do apps i just do everything But apps
i nearly fell asleep on the floor again
uw baby
something something gotta make a run for wharton
everything costs money
but it costs $$???
yeah i'm applying upenn too haha
probably
i thought i hated columbia when i visited but i'm submitting that too
‚Äúheyyy you got in!‚Äù i‚Äôm good thanks
yeet your way into harvard ayyy
never thought i would apply to upenn yet it's happening
LOL RIP
do i want to go to harvard? no. but here i am applying
i still care about these schools, but i dont wanna edit my essays cuz they hurt to read
like they're pretty good essays from my point of view but these AOs are just going too skim and toss
same emily
at this point i‚Äôm just applying to schools i don‚Äôt care that much about
more like the three of all trades
i could just be done now and submit mediocre essays to all my reach schools
jack of all trades, master of none, but better than a master of one
my everything hurts
i‚Äôm just so Done like i don‚Äôt care anymore
but like
i could be done with apps like by the end of tomorrow
yeah i feel fizzled out and resentful of school
i'm well-rounded too
or, more accurately, equally mediocre in everything
college apps are almost over but i don't feel triumphant
you can also emphasize it in supplementaries
grades. IB exams
Know
or do they just look at ur grades and
surprise bitch i‚Äôm Well Rounded
do you say you have strengths in humanities in your essay...?
me as an english major with all STEM classes
in terms of getting into college that is
if you're going into stem it's literally better for you to be stronger in humanities and average in stem than strong in stem but mediocre in humanities
‚Äúwhy English?!‚Äù listen bitch i Just told you
i feel so fake
i keep repeating myself and idk whats what anymore
same emily
i'm going to be beat out for spots in stem schools by people who have strengths in humanities rather than stem üòÇ
i feel like a broken record answering all their questions
none of this is appealing
same im so bland
i have no ideas
ugh my college essays are so uninspired
it's fun
ive never played it before
what is catan
Geez markup is extreme
but the link you sent is the version of the game that i own wow i really guess it was pretty expensive
i was looking at this guy
oh
https://www.amazon.com/Stratego-7470-Sci-Fi-Board-Game/dp/B0045OV9IO
what
its like 19-26 for me
are we talking about the same stratego
what
it's like 50-60 bucks
i got it for christmas
is it
it's so expensive though
I USED TO BE SO GOOD AT STRATEGO
sounds good gene
ill be sure to try it sometime
sounds interesting
its pretty much just like a war
hence stratego
and also strategy
psychological
its very lit
never played it
stratego is LIT by the way
monopoly is super interesting
the only board games i ve played is monopoly and stratego
i have to buy a shit ton of board games and find people to play them with cuz i've never actually played some of the ones i wanna talk about myself
if i die. i wont hav e to do my ee or cas or tok essay/[resenctation
someone murder me
i dont wanna think about the foa
i think the game of life was 1960, so that's an interesting one to look at
i need to pull up a 50s or 60s board game for my FOA cuz it'll be interesting as shit
we stan
takes balls
we love american journalism during the 50s and 60s
what a man
like walter kronkite? big DICK ENERGY
oh
but yes ur right towards the later half of the war
TV was super significant at this point bc after the economic boom people could actually afford that stuff (yay mass production) so now they can see everything happening in the world just by pressing a button. the downside to this is that media as incredible power over how the public things based on how they present stuff on screen
im talkinbg media
it was more like "holy shit we suck at this pull out"
then "ok, let's have big dick energy so it doesnt happen again"
actually, that wasn't the image
they cared more about our BRAVE AMERICAN TROOPS who are FIGHTING against those COMMIES in VIETNAM
let's talk about my FOA where we discussed the influence yellow journalism had over social issues and its perception in society
about the "gay disease"
TV
which
a lot of mainstream didnt care i think
it just has different forms
media is never new
that was new wasn't it
oh right media
media depiction is a large factore here
it's funny cuz education started gitting gu after this all happened
AIDS "only affects faggots"
vietnam is BIG and SCARY and WAR
it's funny how we're able to have this intellectual conversation because of education :^)
AIDS has a lot of influence today, and it impacted a lot of people
but everyone saw Vietnam on TV and saw friends and family get drafted
one of them being the american morale and another being the hope of the new generation
which is why they're obsessed with military and have crazy-ass foreign policy
vietnam was incredibly scarring for america but i want to say that AIDS killed more people than vietnam
and destroyed like 392343 things
the big influence was that it fucked over the american people
and then lost to a bunch of rice framers
oh
containment
we were scared of communism
what was the point of vietnam
also, big dick energy shit cuz we got fucked in vietnam
but some relatively liberal goals and messages kinda make me stop and think a bit
theres always going to be some sort of negative shit going on underlying the high points of America
people in power today were about our age when the vietnam war and the last huge draft was a thing
the end of WWII brought all these cool things to America like technological advances and economic growth and housing and stuff but also Racism
and i dont say this out of some racial motive or anything like im a firm believer in racial/gender/sexuality equality
exact same thing can be said about the vietnam war
so there were a lot of racist influences
like people in their 60s, 70s, and 80s were about our age when the civil rights movement was happening
but sometimes it makes me wonder if we've gone too far
there was a nice middle section in which people were being understanding and change was happening and obviously incorrect things like lynching and outright discrimination were going away
the people from those textbooks being super racist are the ones in gov right now
(Mr. King is a primary source for the 60s)
growing up in the civil rights movement in the 60s does mean that like
there seems to be a lot more animosity
keep in mind
this is a time of political turmoil and idk how its gonna turn out
well
america is very boom or bust
im not on one side or another just confused
we're living through a growth period in America
the weird thing is that we grew up through the civil rights movement and it was a winderful movement but things just seem more jumbled now
if we somehow survive this, we'll definitely make an interesting textbook page
technically them
well i guess the older generation
like the older generation?
so not us? or
its a wonderful way to set things back on the right path
proper education really
as much as i believe that generations are just a social construct, we'll make an interesting couple of pages in a textbook about how the people who grew up through the civil rights movement and vietnam war ironically self-destructed a country
i agree with a statement i heard a while ago that it isnt about the race but rather about the culture and the environment
with stats that show a higher rate of black-on-black violenece and seeing the toxic culture in the less privileged neighborhoods
we should maybe invest in it idk that might be dumb but
education fixes so many problems
valid
some would argue yes but id say it affects a little child in a poor neighborhood a LOT LESS than a well-funded school with well-paid teachers that are eager to teach
but i feel like we're not in the spot to discuss it at the moment as a country (mostly cuz of stigma)
the US has,,,so much money,,,but we're not using it to its true potential
but does it help the common man
it helps some people
i'm not opposed to some forms of socialism
who does spending >50% of the budget on military help?
to be fair, they cant donate to the gov.
but they can at least, idk, not dodge taxes
but like the govern't job is to exist for the people
remind me why we hate communism
the billionaires, although im not too happy with thier actions, can do what they do i guess theyre individual people and america is capitalism
shoutout to the billionaires who are hoarding money and not contributing to the circulation of currency in this economy you the real MVPs
if we have THAT MUCH MONEY LEFT to give to the defense i think we can fix poverty
holy shit
i would understand the rationale. it wouldnt be my go-to choice, but it i would still be fine with it. however, we're not in that situation right now
also highkey we have to take care of lower class families and individuals who rely on the government to survive?
why?????
if theres alrady a shortage of funds and other sects are actively suffering and you STILL choose to buy more guns????
except like
i dont completely agree with the spending of the excess money on just defense but like i wouldnt have an active problem w it
EFFICIENCY PLEASE
if we have the money, then go for it like i dont care
i dont mind spending a shit ton on military as long it's not detracting from other things (which it currently is), is being used efficiently (which it's kinda not), and isn't alarmingly increasing debt (oops)
can we have education now???
now can we PLEASE pay teachers
i think we're Good
a SHIT TON OF IT
we have So mUch of it
a lot of it
we have it
we do need defense
if you think about it the last war we had was incredibly psychologically damaging, which is why old people be like wE neED DEfENSe
like no matter what they say this is ridiculous
but the fact that we need to increase education spending still holds
im sure they have thier own rationale and im willing to give it a listen and see it from their persepctive
and in a cybersecurity crisis, we're literally just developing weapons for other people to copy
our government is run by people who lived through WWII. they scared
confounded
for some war that doesnt exist??? idk im
this is stupid
exactly
then why we investing now
but like
to be fair, military shit does not age well
honestly, at this point, ima just go to the border, build one of those sand castle walls that are like 1 foot tall and be like "give me my millions trump ty"
i think,,,we have enough weapons until america literally dies
thats the most stupid thing ive ever heard of like hello who is running all this? a bag of manure?
it still wouldn't come too close to the defense budget
people lowkey need their paychecks but that's fine mr. trump, you keep crying about your wall or fence or whatever
if you multiply 8 to the amount of $$ that we spend on education
everything is in flames but its fine i guess
>90% of NASA is out of a job atm
i heard that like
o yeah
hell naw
thats right
oh yeah the government is still down
but hell, if you're gonna spend like a dipshit, at least do so on education
efficiency? does the US government know what that means?
just cut budget and spend what you have more efficiently. then you can have big dick energy and spend on education dammit
what's the point
america needs to shed its insecurities and see the light
so at that point
like solely from a spending standpoint
i feel like even with a huge-ass military budget, we kinda suck at using it too
how we gonna learn from history if we still living in history
can we not do this again
you know there are a bunch of schools out there who still use textbooks from like 19-something
but the entire nation's fundamental education system is literally in ruins
and spend more money on their dicks
the rest of us? i just want education man
so they brandish their dicks in case a sissy fight breaks out
i mean, we have several massive dicks in the gov
white people? they're afraid of losing power
like, again, a lot of people hate him
but for what he does, even if he's half-assing, he deserves the god damn money if he's the best you got
like everyone knows we have a massive dick
what are we afraid of
the government makes cuts on the education budget to try to boost the budget for military and arms like??? why???? we literally out number the entire fucking world on how many weapons we own this is ridiculous PAY OUR TEACHERS
i think he gets less now cuz he doesnt do blms anymore, but like that's cuz the band program got too big
he used to teach between 2 schools, work in a super specialized job, work with fancy equipment, and devote a ton of time outside of school hours for both schools
teachers deserve the world they get paid dirt for literally raising the entire ass next generation
TEACHERS DESERVE SO MUCH AND LET ME TELL YOU WHY: my new FOA topic
(except reinch maybe)
like, we don't like him as a teacher but like
every teacher deserves it
he deserves it
we one day found out he gets 100k and is the highest paid isd teacher (or at least was)
but then i thought about it and was like
"well, in an ideal world, he deserves that much, and most of these other teachers deserves similar. i ain't gonna hate on it"
That sent VERY late
you DO deserve it we just don't have Time
ok so the thing is
did you look up his pay
holy shit man somehow
except pitt
no one is a teacher cuz it pays well
that's kinda why they do what they do
like yall know i hate reinsch but even she has feelings
i genuinely believe that the teachers at skyline want to see us thrive and live and be happy
they don't deserve to see us like this
like i want to!!! but i cant,,,,,
sorry, fam. i know you want it. i'm trying too. it ain't working
true gene
god mood
like the patient ones who just want us to be healthy and happy
everything is just on fire and im dying
^^^
i feel like i'm letting down the teachers that actually care sometimes
same i need time to sit down and just take a deep breath and go through things one by one in an organized and sustainable manner but since something massive is being thrown at me by classes every 20 minutes on top of overarching, time-sensitive, larger tasks like TOK, EE, CAS, and college apps
mrs matheny was all like you don't have to turn in your journal don't worry about it. you are clearly burnt out and you need to recharge. im sorry to say, mrs matheny, that i have not been recharging
^^^^^
it's not sustainable
i just need a plan,,,bc rn im just trying to Everything All The Time
not evne close
but this is terrible and definitely not the ideal way
i doubt theyd let us
to cover all the material
we already dont have enough time in classes as it is
i literally cannot Handle everything from college to EE to TOK essay to CAS all at once
alternative: i'm on the brink of graduating and leaving this dumpster fire behind
im on the brink of begging admin to give us time to do the IB things we need to IB succeed
somethings just wrong
he does get it he just needs us to do things and we dont do things and he gets annoyed which isnt his fault or our fault
i feel like he gets it
cw: the struggling single dad of the entire IBDP candidate population
but we literally hAVE NO TIME
it isnt that we dont do it bc we want to screw ourselves up and we dont have any responsibility (maybe a little lol. but)
i mean like thats the thing yall
he was telling me to take time off of ib over break before we got off
like i Wish i could do the things he asks us to, like update CAS but listen there's no TIME
skyline just SUCKS ASS
the man is doing his best
he do his job and he try his best
cw is a victim too like....we give him so much shit but also
this is probably the reason cw craves death every waking hour of the day
skyline wasnt made for ib at all
and he's just like internally screaming
i feel like cw knows and cant do shit about it
listen i love IB. i love TOK and i love how we explore everything in depth in terms of reasoning and perspective. like this shit is valuable. we are taught thinking skills and that's A+ but like,,,skyline you can do better than this
tru tru
you could probably do it for ib bio
this aint it
whatever the solution may be tho
like you cant jump into HL math freshman year unless you're math path 3
cuz pre-reqs
it wouldnt change too much
actually, now that i think of it
give me like. 3 reasons
y tho
yeah i really didnt understand the "yOu cAN oNlY tAke iB stArTinG juNioR YeaR
ib would be super doable if it was over 4 years
its just the way skyline executes it makes everyone want to execute themselves
IB was designed to be taken with 4 years in mind
we start IB in junior year??? we have three year long classes? huh????
i appreciate interdisciplinary approach and tok persepctive stuff like its nice
i dont hate the IB's approach necesaarily
Skyline is not structured for this
IB is for the schools that routinely have breaks and reserve time for IB's random ass shit
there isnt enough TIME
it really isnt
i said this before and i'll say it again this school is not meant for IB Diploma
put them in our shoes for like 10 days.
to be fair, just the ib students
we just,,,don't have the strength anymore
i don't think they understand that we are literally running on nothing
you realize that. , , these decisions actuall. affect real life peoiple rioght...like adolescents.....real people that go to school 5/7 days,,,,,,,,,
every humanities teacher running ISD
sometimes they made decsiions and im like wtf is this this what r u thinking
they need to know what its like man i just
gotta clone him first
he'll get stressed tho
i wish those 93 year old admin would go to each of the schools and take classes in different caliber levels and grades for like. a week
just put paananen in power and everything is solved
isd literally doesnt understand
^^^
paananen for isd dictator
just enough to shut school down
fuck ISD
teachers want the best for us but we have ISD doing their own shit like there‚Äôs no consequences
i hope it snows for 8 days
this is like the least ideal schedule who was in charge of this
i feel bad for teachers
yeah no shit no one would vote for this bullshit this is so dumb
so the teachers are pissed too
that he doesnt remember anyone voting for this
pitt (i think it was him) was telling us
but like
couldnt they just. have ginve us those 3 days
so apparently everyone votes on it a few years in advance
fuck isd and their theiving admin why did we have a break thats like 0.3 days long
ill prolly visit skyline after first semester next year tbh
catch me sobbing my eyes out at 7:30am on Jan 2
i dont wanna go bacl
im just depresso
but seriously, just push back the start time more
extra hw time
but hey
i wanted to take world religions and evergreen but neither fit so i couldnt
eh, i like showing up to band every day
more class time to do things. less classes per day
i would have liked to take mroe classes
A and B days. like liberty
it confusion me
idk exactly how they are changing it
and NOT be drained so much after school
they‚Äôre changing it next year tho
either don't give me homework or give me ample time to do homework
6 classes packed into a 7 hour day. what a good idea
i am excite!!!!!!!!!!!! to have more control over my schedule
well, that's fine
althought it is a lot of self study after college
my god. true
honestly, the thing i'm looking forward to is just having like 2 classes per day
the feelings i have in TOK and English are so different from math and chem
thaks gene
its nice to know about,,,,but thats about it
its different for everybody but people definitely have their own classes they really dont care for
reality has you guys, so it's not that bad
but if you think i‚Äôm gonna spend 12 hours taking notes on history?? i‚Äôm good
reality sucks and we arent going to discuss that here
i like history. i will learn it for pleasure
be quiet gene
but i gotta take it anyways
we don‚Äôt need to talk about that
history really has no meaning to me because i dont wanna go into that
shhhh
<@!460689096646590465> narrator: and then they all took gen ed classes freshman year
^^^ i feel
equals death
i‚Äôm just ready to take classes that matter to me you know?
ibdip senior year plus college apps plus extracurriculars
they should give seniors like a week off for apps
and especially for IB too like
a lot of the people at skyline im ready to say byebye to for the rest of my life
idk how they expected us to do school AND apps
i'm fine with school, but you can't load on extra shit like college apps at the same time
i just cant wait to grad
but what can isay lmao
god i don‚Äôt know how to fix things i just know things are wrong
just that i dont think school is completely right in all it does
im not saying i have a solution or anything
I like "learning", but i don't necessarily like "school"
but like i need some Time to do Things not just a few hours after school
i mean we need school. that‚Äôs how we learn shit
^^^
sometimes you forget how toxic school is until you stop attending it for a while
i can Do Shit when i‚Äôm not in class can you believe that
its much less draining and im overall a way happier person
i did three college apps in the course of two days without school
same
so much more productive without school
i‚Äôm just
nice!!
I have 3 more apps, and I just need to edit my essays, do FASFA, and polish up a portfolio
Yay!
just one more essay and i'm in the clear!
i'm almost done too yayyyy
or the ones i most want to apply to anyway
woot i'm pretty much done with college apps
i did one extra
one extra is fine
when colleges offer you to submit an optional letter of rec (e.g. a particular college requires one and has an optional second one), have you guys been including the optional one? i'm not sending like 5 extra or anything, but one extra is fine, right?
how do we self-report SAT scores again? just in that thingy in common app?
FAFSA and CSS are the same in my mind cuz i havent looked at either of them yet
yeah
It's probably January 15th for the FAFSA, if you read something about Jan 15
Oop
UW doesn't have css
Idkkkkk I just read their website
jan 15th what
January 15???
idk i havent done it yet lol
I thought uw was only fafsa?
better sooner rather than later
but like
UW doesnt need it until the 15th tho
me neither
Ugh I haven't done this yet
"yo, i have x dollars"
Oh found it
where like
some financial profile stuff i think
What is CSS?
Umm
it is
Ewww that sounds like work but ok
both
Do we have to do both CSS and FASFA or just one?
i should not have waited this long
im on that last minute grind

so there's that too
also, you're an intelligent human being who put a lot of effort into their college applications

NOW is the time to think about TRANSFERING into [school] for your junior year
yes?
you guys think colleges will keep sending us emails once we're in college?
this means that about every 40th person in wyoming attends the university of wyoming
fun fact: the university of wyoming makes up about 2.4% of the state's population
hmm apparently they dont even force you to declare a major until your sophomore year, so i could talk about "appreciating the diverse options of academic exploration and discovering a interest of study that truly captivates me"
im basically looking through their website right now to finesse an essay
but i lack an answer
good question
Which degree?
obligatory ivy application, and it looks like the one that would make me least miserable
Why are you appling to Penn?
how do finesse?
cuz i kinda dont wanna go
but i have no idea what i would even study there
the prompt basically asks what i plan to do at penn
but like
and i'm trying to do it now
so i'm getting yelled at my family for not having written my penn essay
wadup
yo, anyone got the moment for some fast advice?
like testing and extracurriculars
i feel like it would in other facets of student life
Or would that just breed more competition?
School wide GPA curve?
but the whole grades thing is kinda problematic in itself
skyline makes a ton more sense
but when you put it that way
i was mainly asking out of curiosity
yeah, i totally agree
and I think the fixation on grades and grades alone destroys a lot of the meaning of school
there's no way of standardizing gpa across schools
tbh I just think grades are held in too high of a regard among all high-performing students
at the same time, we also have a huge culture of systematic cheating to get said 4.0 or at least very good grades, and idk what that says about how difficult it is to attain
I think skyline has a lot of people w 4.0s that don't necessarily deserve them, and I think the fact that 4.0 is seen as standard is kinda ridiculous (though I'm sure that's the same across the country)
define inflated/deflated/middle
is anyone else sitting here a week before reg decision apps looking for more schools to apply to like the meme i am?
L
pitt just puts in 0s for our final and we still get As
i took the ultimate slacker class in band tbh
w o r l d r e l i g i o n s
**B A N D**
laughs in purposely took some slacker classes this year
thanks
ok, seems fair
it's not alright, but it's okay
rest in peace hl math, hl history, and hl physics
which, no es bueno
but some classes are still a ravage
^^^ forgot about that
plus we have the "grace" %s in comparison to on level, ie 92% = A
alright, i can see that
a lot of classes have really generous linear bumps
tbh i'd say inflated???
skyline ib as a whole?
okay that's fair lol
^lmao
*teacher
depends on the class honestly
so just curious, weighting aside, do you guys feel skyline grades are inflated, deflated, or rather middle-middle?
Oof same for me
all these deadlines will light up tomorrow gah
school of foreign service
What is sfs?
everyone else is business or general
prob
I think I might be the only one who applied SFS anyway
sounds like you've got company then
well
lmao
also everyone from skyline got deferred from georgetown lol
(and also your monies for tuition lol)
they should be fucking grateful to have y'all hahaha
DAMN RIGHT
Helen and Jiayi both into umich!!
nice
AHHHH IM SO HAPPY FOR YOUUUU
CONGRATS
CONGRAYS
DAMNNNN
Just waves of relief now haha
I'm so happy!
The Science of Deduction

sell both kidneys, then get an emergency donation
don't need to pay for college at all that way
ü§†
that's why you sell both
selling a kidney on the black market isn't enough to pay for four years at some colleges
soooo legal
who needs college with all that legal money
solid plan
me
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
and i'm always here to support y'all
Some blind person in NY sued 50 colleges because their websites weren't accessible to blind people
CIA at the time I believe
just remember that y'all are some of the highest-achieving folks i've ever met. if some college struggles to see that, know you'll still end up in a great place
dad is the head of the CIA
well maybe have you considered your daddy is the fucking president of the us
I'd love if they posted a wall of weird for the admissions process
:/
...
when george bush says its ez to get into ivy league with even low grades
yeah I'm sure
Colleges probably get lots of letters like that when they reject/defer people
never will meet a man like that in my life
never met a man like that in my life
we love juanus d
F
possibly, idk, juan d wrote to the uw office like "your loss" the first time he got rejected and now he's transferring there so
depends on the admission officer
sad
well it takes guts
Probably
lmao
would telling the school to suck my asshole significantly decrease my chances
derailed and rerailed
But if you cared about your looks that way you'd probably care more about a nice haircut than legs
wait ok but going back to the point of this channel <@!472541429130854421> don't like get your hopes up but don't take deferral as rejection either, write a letter of continued interest if you're still interested
i wouldnt know
i've never used one lol
??
a rozor is $2
asian male: no one believe you when you're 17 and say you've never shaved
This happened to my mom
Asian female: all your white friends are baffled as to why you spend so much effort/money into hairless legs when you don't even buy haircuts at a salon
ya sure?
it's just you
take all my leg hair.....i dont need it....................................
bro my dad's legs are so hairy
asian male: next to no leg hair whatsoever oops
just wear pants for 2 days
Anyway I can't feel any leg hair right now
Because when it's the season to show off legs the hair will grow back
It's not useful
same
id love it if all my leg hair disappeared every time i wore pants wtf
we're expected to not have it
leg hair isnt the same for us noah........
Lol
o_o
you're male and therefore irrelevant to this conversation
what? that sounds bad not good
^^
how
why are you blessed
^^
your pants rub your leg hair off?
what in the fuck
jkjk
I didn't feel like switching just for that comment smh
put it in the puppers chat
My leg hair actually disappears in the winter because my pants rub them off
of all places
why in this chat
lol
Lmao
anyways
also this is totally unrelated but I'm not wearing pants for the first time in a while and goddamn my leg hair is SO LONG
which school
Not even doing research on them unless they have an essay asking about that lol
So I'm changing my strategy to just applying randomly to any college I may be vaguely interested in if I got in
At this point the college I'm counting on the most is already completely out of my hands and sphere of control
definitely things to think about
yeah
I figured, but I still thought it was worth pointing out
yeah i've thought about all of that already
mhm
sorry if I'm just spouting shit you already know, and I'm sure I am, but yeah. food for thought I guess
idk like objectively you're one of the best at skyline, but that doesn't necessarily mean much when you look at the whole country and beyond, and really, none of us are special unless we force ourselves to stand out. that's not something to be depressed about, but it is just reality that there's gonna be hundreds of students with comparable stats and similar stories and essay-writing skills applying to the same places. what's your passion? because you can't compete with people who genuinely care about a field when you don't share that love. it really does show and it's one of the reasons I'm such a proponent for just pursuing what you like the most, not just what you're good at. what specifically sets you apart? what specific traits and accomplishments can you highlight on your application?
i'm v aware that i'm all over the place
mhm
but keep it in mind
i know
yeah
don't beat yourself up about it
and that's my own fault lol
but yeah my stanford app wasn't cohesive with how i put it together
i've been more focused in more apps when it came to essays and stuff
mhm i know
tbh, that's very common
I know you probably know this already, but schools aren't really looking for people who are just good students in general
ok you've probably heard this before from me but you lack focus, and I know it's something you've already been struggling with, and you don't need to have your whole life figured out by this point, that's not what I'm saying, but I think your biggest disadvantage rn is just your confusion about what direction you want to go in. You applied to economics for stanford right? Have you done anything to show an interest in econ in the past 4 years? And could you honestly see yourself going into econ and being happy with it, happier than if you'd picked another option?
yeah
and do you want my honest opinion/advice, assuming you haven't submitted all your apps yet
so stanford didn't want you, doesn't mean other schools won't, doesn't mean you weren't `good enough`
i mean at this point, it's not the decision itself - more the implication
don't take the rejection too hard, I know it's been a dream for a long ass time, but seriously, it's one of the most infamously competitive schools in the world
i know my mindset is skewed
idk
and like i know it shouldn't bother me this much but there's a kind of unshakeable feeling of uncertainty. i want to know why i wasn't good enough and see if i can change that in other apps.
and dude your first college decision was fuckin stanford
but like. realistically all of us are pretty solid students, I'm probably the worst honestly, and even if you don't get into your top choices, it's gonna be aight, yknow? there's no way any of us will get rejected from everything unless you only applied to like the top 5, I believe in y'alls talent, and college will be fun regardless, so just keep on keeping on for now
my first college decision thing being a rejection has not been good for my headspace lmao
i'm ready for the worst at this point lol
that's nice
like I'm sure there will be several soul-crushing rejections in my future
tbh I'm feeling relatively optimistic
laughs in preparing to be rejected from everything
there may be other people out there
some dumbass college might think for some dumbass reason they're worth accepting and you're not
that does not make them better or more valuable
cuz you guys are some of the best and most valuable individuals i've ever had the pleasure of meeting

_there can only be one_

thats so sad
there are 7 people out there with your exact face

sammmeeeeee
theres a kid out there exactly like me
im not spceial
yep there are like 10000 iterations of me out there born in 2001
love that self esteem bost !1!111!!
this whole app process reminds me how insignificant and a-dime-a-dozen my entire existence is
when ivy league puts you in the iv league

i am applying to way too many reach schools and setting myself up for heartbreak when i get into 3 of 20 colleges but that's ok
pin the tail on the donkey
or piss all over the table and just accept who hasnt been hit
"this is the fuck u hall named by spielberg"
i think they just play darts
i bet they literally use RNGs or flip coins to decide sometimes
"so uh"
then its just an agonizing crapshoot from there
be like steven spielberg and donate a shit ton to the program that rejected you 3 times after you get famous so that they're forced to name shit after you and explain the story
but the incoming freshman class is only 2000
for most dream schools, its like good stats are a prerequisite for admissions consideration, and there are lets say 10000 people perfectly qualified
just remember later when your net worth is $392 billion then those schools will regret
r i p
üôÉ
they didnt deserve you anyways
better to have peace of mind and say byebye to ur defer school
yall right
deferral=rejection pretty much
i feel
which is basically rejection
thank u, next
i so fuckin' grateful for my Safety
fucking up my USC app means best case scenario is getting accepted into my dream school as undeclared and no financial aid
deferral gives me peace of mind because it basically means rejection
good luck with the deferral! you got this!
Ayyy deferred from dream school team
‚ù§
sorry to hear you didn't get accepted, good luck on the deferral
it's not the decision that bothers me it's the uncertainty
but at least I can stop stressing now until march
v unsurprised, I heard they rarely accept EAs unless you're a gov major or legacy
deferred from georgetown
asking someone out: getting rejected twice means you were probably pushy and shouldnt have done that
applying to college: HOLY SHIT NICE JOB YOU MIGHT GET--oh, well, you got close. no worries. be proud of yourself. this other good school is still accepting you.
I love being rejected twice
üòÑ
that's not pessimism
that's a whole 'nother level of depressing
pessimist v2: you now get to be rejected not once, but twice!
oof but true
more pessimist: you've been less rejected than the rejected people
ty
that makes more sense
ah alright, i get you
it means you're not rejected yet
it means you get a 2nd chance
then deferral is great
a really good school
if it's like
which like, i'm happy for them, but i've also seen people online get big time sad when they get hit with the deferral
i've seen people literally jumping up and down in skyline cuz their friends got deferred
and depends on the school
neutral
not that i've been getting deferred (no EA or ED), but when someone tells me they've been deferred, i'm unsure if i'm supposed to be happy or sad for them cuz i don't understand them implications
also, do we tend to view deferrals as good things or bad things? cuz i've seen it both ways, and i've been confused
e n d  m e
just
history study guide and french assignments too
figure out my fucking bio IA
prepare shit for two clubs tomorrow
do a stats assignment
then i have to get all caught up in TTL (from chap 17)
lmao, edits are the last thing i need
i still gotta do upenn and nyu apps by the end of the day (but just one essay each, so we gucci)
fair
my point is that i want to stab people now
anyone who wants edits on anything hmu
good job!!
wtf
also, i just cranked through the entire stanford app, the one considered to be the infamously long one, in 2.5 hours
USC apps too me all of thanksgiving weekend and then some
show them you already know how to work in the professional world
exactly
this is how i get a full ride to stanford
solid plan
also I like your ending words
then do your line and offer them one
don't even fucking ask, bring your own mirror and pull it out in the middle and start chopping it up while still talking
and then whispering into their ear "if you accept me, you can do cocaine with me for the next four years. think about that."
geez
<@!193229269076279298> nah, fam. true assertion is doing the line and then offering the interviewer to do a line with me
do the line
assert your dominance Gene
I probably wouldn't have noticed
but if I hadn't been looking for it
I'm always one to intentionally misconstrue innocent statements
does it?
do a line during the interview
brb gonna get some cocaine so i can fit what i'm presenting
*dabs*
that's FINE
LMAO

Dear future roommate,
    I‚Äôm going to be as straightforward with this a possible‚ÄîI‚Äôm a little bit messy. That manifests itself in different ways, both expected and unexpected, but it‚Äôs the proper place to start this introduction. Yes, the sheer amount of things I keep on my desk or in my backpack might be intimidating at first glance, but there‚Äôs rhyme and reason to what I do.
    I have a love for novelty. Experimenting with new ideas or searching for ways to get a laugh out of the unexpected are my favorites things to do. As a result, I‚Äôm always thinking of ways of what to do next that could add this spark to my life. I‚Äôm sometimes a little bit scatterbrained because I‚Äôm wondering how I could go about the next new idea. I might spend one minute pacing around while lost in thought and the next trying a new sport or seeing a movie from a genre I wouldn‚Äôt normally think to watch.
 The reason I‚Äôm so messy with both my space and my thoughts is because there are so many new experiences to be had. In fact, many of the things I carry with me or leave out on my desk often directly pertain to what I want to do next‚Äîa new novel to read later, a stuffed animal to take somewhere unexpected on a whim, or even just a notebook for doodling or jotting down new ideas.
This coming year is going full of new experiences for both of us. I hope that we can share spontaneous moments together. There‚Äôs nothing better than being able to share new ideas with others and getting excited about them together. Hopefully we can make the most out of the coming year together and discover experiences worth remembering.
                        Sincerely,
                        Your future roommate
here's the college essay in question for the curious:
"hey, these stanford apps are coming along pretty well!"
*writes letter to roommate*
"shit, well, at least it's not THAT ba--"
*realizes it sounds like i probably do a bunch of drugs even though the craziest thing i've done is take an advil after having a headache*
"i guess that can be edited or some--"
*realizes it sounds like i'm offering my roommate drugs*
"well, fuck"
Will take a few days to reach the West coast
They probably mailed it yesterday lmao
you got this!
‚ù§
for now, try not to worry too much
i'm sure you'll hear back soon
tbh I'm fine I was most stressed on friday, expecting a deferral
yeah it is, old-fashioned I guess
weird that they don't have an online portal set up tho
im sorry. that's gotta be rough
i guess
yay
so
and I just did looks like I'm not the only one
really?
nope
does georgetown have an admissions portal?
check reddit?
idk if that means i was supposed to get it by then or if they mailed them yesterday
idk they just said they'd be released yesterday
when are you supposed to get your decision by?
but the suspense is kinda killing me
I know they mail their decisions
never heard back from georgetown lmao
so I just
40% on the final, you're flying high
join us on r/EngineeringStudents where we're all shit and everything is shit
r/ApplyingToCollege, where most people have a 3.95+ GPA, a 1550 SAT or higher, 3 different 800 subject test scores, a 35 on the ACT, started a charity, self-esteem issues, and yet still provide a pretty good source of college app info, so you spend way too much time on it anyways
ah r/ApplyingToCollege such a great place
https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/a6t6ym/my_thank_you_next_college_apps_parody_comment/?utm_source=reddit-android
thank you
take care of yourself
Thanks for the help
I just need some time to think
I'm gonna go for a bit
Save for being an asshat I guess
I have how I became everything I never wanted to be
and figure that shit out
They only seem demanding because I've made them so
then you're gonna need to readjust
Not that the classes are too demanding
The root of the problem if that late work and procrastinated stuff keeps piling on and I have thousands of others responsibilities
but i know reducing other stressors can honestly really help
i can't pretend to know you super well and know the root of all your problems
if you could lessen the school load, it could help you tackle the other problems
but
It's not IB either
I swear to God it's not school
bc it's clearly not working for you
I just can't get enough of this work done
consider talking to Flemer about adjusting workload
i would seriously
I'd rather it just be over at this point
and the fact that you're shutting that down is so incredibly concerning
getting help is so fucking important
because dear lord
i'd rather that you have someone to help you
and i can handle a lot of stress and pressure
i haven't dealt with that much out of the ordinary
That matters to me too
look, i'll be fine
I'm really thankful, but like I understand you have a lot going on in your life too tho
shutting down on people who want to support you and make sure you're doing okay is NOT productive
literally just ask
and if you ever need any help in any classes
i'll help you talk to vB if you want
i've already dragged Noah through his own problems and I can try to help you
look, if it helps, feel free to talk to me
in ANY sense of the word
At least recently
that can't be helpful
jesus fuck
so like i said, i am not the best indicator in any way
I've been trying my best to avoid talking about it for everyone else's sanity
not just for you
my sympathy almost always has an undercurrent of "get yo shit together" for everyone
It's wearing thin
I understand
but
i still have sympathy
rip
I've been told that it's been so long that it's getting hard to be sympathetic
3) might be better to get some other people's opinions
2) idr
1) i'm a bleeding heart that gets concerned over everything
nglllll
i am not the right person to be asked this
Well, how long have I been worrying you guys?
use that as your gauge
it's been a month since UW admissions
Idk
since when
Has it been a month?
you've seemed to be in quite the dark place for a while now
so i think it could be really beneficial to figure out how to improve your own mental health
i got through it but i wouldn't want to force people go without that kind of support
so i understand
when i asked to maybe see a therapist a few years back, my parents were like "no, you don't have a mental illness you're just stupid"
i know
But like if my parents find out
rip
It's not in itself
And that could start a shitshow
is that necessarily a bad thing
oooof
that's shit
If I talk to Flemer, she's gonna reach out to the mental health counselor
and you know what
and i think you're reaching a critical breaking point
working through it on your own isn't helping
at this point, you need to reach out
and it could help to talk to Flemer
it could help to explain how it's hit you in the long-term
I don't really wanna talk to people anymore
Idk
Gregory has just kinda looked at me and been like "wait, I didn't even give you he last night. How did this happen?"
would it help if someone was with you to talk to vB
ouch
I'm surprisingly having a hard time communicating with vB
I've been communicating with Matheny a lot
how much have you been communicating with teachers and stuff
i think you've brought it up a couple of times
yeah
ooooooooooOOOOF
Well, I have been for a while
I'm starting to feel physically unwell too
it might help to take time for yourself honestly
The only thing I know is that I can't keep doing this
we're not going to get a definitive break
I know
after IA season is IB tests
once college apps are over, it's IA season
and i'm sorry that's the case
it won't
but realistically?
i understand that
I just really want it to stop for a while
i think that's the case for many of us
yeah...
I'm starting to realize I won't even have much free time this break
i feel
rip
Cuz everything that's good for me is everything that's bad for me
starting out with valuing your own time and being kind to yourself
I just don't know how to fit self-care into my life right now
things aren't going to change unless you make changes
No, it's not mean
but i'm trying to be very honest
i don't mean for any of this to be mean
but you need to take care of yourself too
some people need support and kindness and patience from others and that's okay
you don't need to be sorry
or whatever
or me
don't be sorry to us
you need to be willing to help yourself
I'm sorry
and it's really depressing to see
i mean i know i only speak for myself, but everyone's seen you go through some serious lows
that it's honestly worried a ton of us
you've been so overwhelmed with school and stuff
but at the same time, you need to pick and choose your battles
i really do
and i get that feeling
i feel like you're constantly scared of how people might respond to you asking for help
but you really do need to learn to help yourself
Abbreviations are hard
yeah
Oh
ammurica first
make america great again
I don't know what that is
and this is starting to parallel MAGA a bit too much, but you know what that's okay
and you should be using it in a way that works for YOU FIRST
SO IS YOURS
but you know what
their time might be important
i don't care if they're the world's best writers; if they can't compromise on this and do what's best for you as well, they're not actually helping you
I know you're right
but it's also good to take care of yourself
it's good to get help
yes
because damn you need some self-respect
then say something about you needing to respect yourself
They'll say some shit about me not respecting their time
because you know what?
let them know how you felt after they snapped at you for not applying to UCs
let them know that you're overwhlemed
like i think you really do need to just plant your flag here
It's ok. I understand
and sorry my wording isn't on point but rn i'm more concerned about other things
in my experience, they tie together pretty closely
It's more of a fear of the consequences
but it's what i think needs to be said
It's not really a desire to please anyone
and i'm sorry that's blunt
you've let your desire to please others get in the way of you being happy
because that's exactly what you're doing
until it makes you start to self destruct
I'm not trying to be
being nice and wholesome is great
like
can you stop being nice to other people for a second and be nice to yourself
it
rationalize
to
trying
stop
dude
In some ways, it's kinda my fault
the AOs have already got us quaking in our boots
Idk, I mean, they did give me weeks of advance notice
you need support, not another figure to fear
they're creating unnecessary stress in an already stressful process
because it seems like they've been pretty unfair to you
you should try to bring it up
BUT
that makes them shit people in that regard
then
I don't think they'll care too much
i don't give a flipping fuck that they're successful now
because you SHOULDN'T be scared of asking them for help
have you tried explaining how their attitudes have affected you?
i'm sorry
And they're never gonna let me live it down
They're gonna be pissed at me
Idk, man
(plus we're nicer :p)
we can help you edit later
just do your hw first
I have a shit ton of homework to do too
... yeah... rip
I was gonna wake up at 8:30 to finish them, but my brain said no
aw i'm sorry
I fear his wrath
anddddddddddddddddddddddddd L!
For editing
My brother wanted all the rest of my apps by Friday
you okay?
what
I love the fact that I dun fucked up again
hahaha guess who just fell asleep while trying to be productive but while actually not
a g a i n
im not surprised
That idea originated with MIT and Caltech rivalry
Fun fact: UWrejects.com redirect's to WSU's website
*laughs in USC app*
which is why i'm glad that's the one i messed up on
nope
You don't actually care much about cmu though righr
O o f
because all of the word counts have expanded since last year
i should have read the updated CMU application before writing it
i should‚Äôve applied to more safeties
‚ù§
heyyyyy congrats
good job!
i saw people celebrating fordham on reddit
gooooooooooooooooood luck
They were both safeties though big one is tomorrow
Oh yeah I forgot to mention this earlier but I got into drexel and fordham
<@503787499605458954> Don't worry. It's gonna turn out alright. Just take a deep breath and let the days keep coming for now. You got this.

apparently fafsa asks you to register for the draft, but i'm legally compelled to anyways, so i think my parents just don't understand how the draft works (which is fair, cuz it's a little weird to see it on a financial aid thing)
i think usc requires me to, so idk
Lol
cuz my parents were like "yo, the gov is gonna register you for the military," and i have no idea what they mean
Deadline for financial aid is much later than app usually
Fine
Gene I think that's find
but like none of these requirements were actually on the thing
oh, also, is it ok if i said i planned to apply for need-based financial aid but never get around to doing css and fasfa cuz im lazy af?
like a month ago they also sent me some shit about needing confirmation that I plan to be a us citizen
Good thing my dad still checks the mail üò¨
they're probably annoyed @ me at this point lmao
wait, im probably waiting until march lol
Yeah I didn't know about it either
You can probably send just your best
I just got a letter saying I still need to submit mine whoops
IDK I only have one
do you know if you need to send all sat scores to the national merit corp
but
ish
i'm not even sure when i'm supposed to hear back from USC or UW
random
wait helen
(note to self: not everything is about you)
We can open that together
In a month I'll get my Georgia tech one
ooooo
I was talking to Cindy lol
i'm not getting mine for at least a month
don't lol
I'll save it until you get yours too
Mine comes out at 9:15 am lol
that's going to happen anyway
Ayyyy
don't want someone crying and someone celebrating at the same time
only one person at a time tho
I'm down
We should open ours together on video call lmao
I also have my mit one on Saturday
<@503787499605458954> ah good luck!!!
for the student, it's easy mode
for the school/applicant pool, it's hard mode
generally
EA is also more competitive
well
lol
so if you didn't make it in on easy mode they say why not try it on hard mode, makes sense
or be like me and dont apply early anywhere cuz bad decisions are bad
gtown has one of the most advantageous EAs from what I've seen
yeah it is
they wanna compare you to the skrubz
isn't it easier to get in with EA?
but what's the point, if you didn't make it the first time
yeah
EA is basically a second chance
so you get a second go around
no they just defer your app to regular decision
so they make a really long ass waiting list?
wait really?
I'm expecting a deferral
but it's low pressure, they don't outright reject EAs
good luck!
gtown saturday
Anyone anticipating any college decisions soon?
yeah
but what cindy said is usually the move
you can also call cornell if you're feeling it
k then
the business one has a bit about double majoring with CALS and taking on an AEM (admin and management) major
^^
pick the one you care about more and then figure out double major stuff later/if you can do it
CALS (life science) site says you have to stay within the school
but i'm wondering which school to apply to (business or life science) bc idk exactly how the process works
so i'm applying to cornell and am considering doing bio + business double majors, which is def possible
what's up?
can someone help me figure something out real quick
yeah everything is fine lol
everything alright?
I just had a scare that I didn't successfully send my transcript to my EA schools
college apps give me headaches
and we are back on topic
my only true companion
ah headaches
I struggle to make a meaningful distinction between the two entities
I am not entirely sure
this chat
lmao rip
Who's winning?
I almost have a competition with my own brain to see who can cause me a headache faster and with greater intensity
rip
I almost have a competition with <@!340319804747415553> over whether she can use the same words over and over more or I can come up with weirder and weirder ways of saying things
I start seeing all the ways those phrases can be applied and then I gotta hold myself back
but as soon as I get used to it
ü§Ø
üò∞
sorry helen
ya same
üò´
yeah
change my mind
I already used hot sec to be fair
hot sec has always been a thing
`hot sec`
"expose her queen"
EWWW
`it really do be like that sometime`
