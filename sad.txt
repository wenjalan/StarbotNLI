The opposite of hers rn though
My sleep schedule is like

a wizard101 ad
i just got
i just want more soju 🙂
Roosevelt Cafe open during pandemic
Wanna do another sleepover? LOL
But crackhead decision making will work its way into them plans
I always play well
nobody said anything about playing well
I could probably still play Smash
I genuinely want to go back and try to finish an entire can of Strong by myself to see exactly how badly it would fuck me up
my brother had a whole bottle that day, which was a first for him
although i tried a sip of a Stella Artois the other day and it wasnt all that bad
now *that* is not wack
Beer is gross
now *that* is wack
Also I like vodka
Lmao
Fuck you too
its just vodka tastes bad
I'm not weak
wack
Indeed
straight vodka?
I did vodka shots over video call w friends
No
oh are you back in vancouver already?
That genuinely sounds like a good idea
just wrap pillows around your head with lots of duct tape and go back to bed
Save me from this hell
I'm hungover as fuck and it's our next door neighbours turn to get their roof replaced
man thats a lotta people *that* mad over not using the word trap
The fact that people were That pissed about the whole thing.......... yikes dude
Our society is still really fucking transphobic
Even with how far we've come w social progress
I've always felt like
k
partly because there was announcement by one of the mods saying that the admins were on their asses, but the community took it well
most mentions of the conflict in the other sub have subsided and users have moved on to just posting regular anime memes now
as for r/goodanimemes, they've basically achieved their goal of reestablishing the anime meme community in another location
it's still early to determine the reason for the closure, but if it's for the reasons we think it is (nothing but revolution memes for two weeks) this would be an amazing case study
last I checked this morning r/animemes was nearing 800k after dropping from 900k+
meanwhile, r/goodanimemes is nearing 200k subs
the mods have closed the sub to the public
update on the r/animemes situation
wd40
the name of this server?
i still dont know what WD is tho
i automatically saw the WD and read it as WD40
Or maybe that’s not slice of life idk since I’ve never watched one fully
And there needs to be more romantic drama
If it’s a high school slice of life anime, that’s basically us except everyone needs to be a little more archetypal and most of us are happy all the time except that one stereotypically angry person and the tsundere
I’m not sure a soap company could become Fortune 500
What are these ideas 😂
> WD but everyone wears toe shoes except for Fran
nightmare fuel
I feel like the Noah-Salina dynamic would be viewed slightly differently if that were the case
`WD but we're all siblings`
selling soap products
WD but we're executives of a fortune 500 company
WD but we run a restaurant
WD but we live on a remote island
WD but we're all members of a homeless camp
WD but everyone wears toe shoes except for Fran
WD but we're all siblings
WD but it's set in rural America
WD but it's Shakespeare
WD but it's a fraternity
WD but cyberpunk
WD but it's fantasy
WD but it's an anime high school slice of life
WD but it's an American high school sitcom
WD but everyone is in deca
*heehee*
I dont think I act much different tbh
WD alignment chart but it's everyone when they're tipsy
I wouldn't even show up
rip

It’s gonna be fuckin 95 degrees today 😱
Not fun :/
So imagine trying to haul an old guy to the toilet while trying to 1) not step in shit, 2) not slip in the massive puddle of urine, and 3) after you’ve been hit
Well they pissed and shit on the floor
i never hit anyone after i shit on the floor
hmm
thats
umm
My life is wild
What a time
...
I got socked in the throat by a patient who had just taken a massive shit on the floor
ahh
Hit
or hit?
hit on?
But all the fucking semantics and poorly managed logistics
Not for the actual job itself
God I kind of hate my job right now
And first time getting seriously hit by a patient
First time getting incredibly screwed by management
Some more job firsts today woo

i'll join you guys with my chicken coop project
ooh ooh im in
time to go build another table in front of Cindy's window
gahhhhhhhhh
wood rather not
you should ask them if they
there's always someone over here chopping wood
Everyone's doing renovation projects of some kind and it's SO FUCKING LOUD I wanna die
Anyways re-upping what everyone else already said as well, especially Helen's comments, you bounce back fast. Fully support whatever you do decide on 💖
That’s fair, I was just here to derail you w a joke haha
Tech giant still an option and I have no doubt that you'd be able to if you wanted later, but no better time to take risks than when you're young
> As a result I no longer think a large company would be a good fit for me, I'd probably prefer a small one or even a startup
No I meant this
Sorry
:p
Oh lol
Huh
Jkjk ily
By last bit do you mean the coffee part 🤔
I always thought it was a bit surprising that you wanted to go for a big company and stay there forever
Ooooooh wait okay the last bit is actually super exciting
Whatever that thing may be
Do your thing Alan
i fully support you being up at 6 for this
It really sucks that CSE didn’t/might not work out, but I’m glad that you found another major you would enjoy doing so quickly. You have great resilience and I think that’s a really admirable trait 🙂
Now if you'd excuse me, this coffee isn't working, I'm gonna go nap a little maybe
You guys helped me realize that I was more than a coder, I'm a designer, explorer, engineer and much more, and for that much, I'm very thankful
I will miss the huge buildings and fancy classrooms, but I think I'll be able to meet more people I like this way and be doing things closer to what I want to in the future
Anyways, tech stuff aside, it boils down to CSE didn't want me, and I decided I didn't want them either
As a result I no longer think a large company would be a good fit for me, I'd probably prefer a small one or even a startup
Things that were more bug fixing and incredibly small in the grand scheme of the app
These were things like "make the keyboard on the Notes app integrate with the Android keyboard better"
A Google engineer I met told me about how he chose a task from a set of things he was assigned and did that thing until it was done, day in and day out
The idea of being 1 of 200 identical coders on a single project sounds like literal torture to me
But I've been wondering recently if a Software Engineer position would actually suit me
In terms of career prospects too, the job market is pretty much exactly the same as CSE since tech will hire you regardless of the name of your degree as long as you can write code
Seeing as every single thing I've ever made was made with the intention of being used by people, not programmers, I don't know how I didn't make this connection earlier
Helen probably gets what I mean when I say CSE at UW is very theory heavy, whereas HCDE and Info are more user centric
Both programs, in contrast with CSE, offer more emphasis on the user experience and application design process, which I found more closely resembles the work I've done as a programmer than solving LinkedList problems on paper.
HCDE and Informatics are both computing majors, but have different goals than pure CSE. HCDE is commonly associated with UI/UX design, and Informatics deals with "how information flows about our world" or something deafeningly broad like that.
I'll apply again to CSE in Winter, and if they change their minds about me, I'll change my mind about them.

But in the meantime, I'm going to be aiming for two other programs at UW (Fran this means no I'm not transferring): Human Centered Design Engineering and Informatics
3. What now?
Which leads me to my last point
I know this because you guys taught me that I'm more that just a mere programmer or CSE student. You guys showed me that I have promise in fields extending outside the realm of pure CSE, particularly in communication, exploration, and design.
They decided that someone with a perfect 4.0 would suit their needs better, and if that's the kind of program CSE at UW is, then I don't want to be in that program.
By declining me, they basically told me that my math grades were as important a deciding factor as the years of personal and community work I've put in.
They're not looking for people who can make apps and programs from the ground up, or for people who can lead, teach, and design.
The fact that the Allen School was able to read my personal statement and decline me based on my math grades told me more about the kinds of people they're looking for.
Many of you read the personal statement I wrote, even edited and saw its growth over the course of a few weeks. I still stand by that that personal statement is the best thing I have ever written, and am still eternally thankful for everyone's help.
I was shocked, yeah, up until now this situation was one of my worst nightmares. But when the dust settled, I took a hard look at myself and CSE as a whole. The Allen School at UW had decided that I wasn't the kind of person they were looking for, and after a bit of exploration, I realized that they weren't the right school for me either.
2. what about cse?
Shirakami Fubuki had a new outfit debut and it's SUPER cute/cool
1. why am I up at 6
lemme start answering some questions
hard days over
darn that really sucks, thanks for letting us know fran 😦
that's awful
thanks fran
Alright thank you for letting us know
Hey, everyone. Looks like the reckoning of 2020 strikes again. Jokes aside, I come to sad boi hours with something

**[SERIOUS]**

 From the looks of things, earlier today, Alan got an email. He asked me to relay to you that he's going to be going offline for some time. The CoE didn't accept his placement request into CompE. He remains as an ENGRUD student at UW, but I imagine he's going to be taking some time to plan out his next steps going forward. His mind, as you know, is extremely active, perhaps overactive, so these are going to be some really really hard days for him ahead. Chances are it'll be 100% radio silence from him until he's sure and ready with whatever his plan is. I can't predict what that will be, but whatever it is I'm sure it'll be well thought-out and he'll take us through it cause he'll need us for it. We gotta be here for him then, and we'll be here for him until then too.

Stay healthy.
We'll get through the chaos of this year and those to come.
I hear tor browser works wonders for doing questionable things
unfortunalty i dont know of any heroin dealers

Why are old guys like so fuckin pervy
Also I wanna be salty for a sec
It’s ok
(Idk why but it seems like I’ve been making all my happy announcements in sad boi hrs lmfao)
Less exciting :D
Woooo
I have not lost my license
Thanksssss I’m pretty excited
On my end
Look at you go girllll
OOOOH
Speaking of work I got a return offer to Microsoft for next summer 😄
Send help
Workday
Fuckin
So much work today
Lmao me too
Sorry I’m so fuckin tired lmao
Welcome to the boat
But so is all of ours
Your brain broken
Lmao
I saw “front end” and “back end” but thought it was about code lol
That's what I thought when I first saw it
IM RIGHT
SEE
SEE
Legit
I LEFOT CANT TELL
That makes no sense for an ad campaign photo tho
Am I dumb
What if that is the back end
Wait
True
()_____________()
The front end could totally be the back end
Ok I think my biggest gripe is just
It's like a trapezoid
The hood is too, and the front bit is just straight down
The windshield is at such a weird angle
^ car face
It's almost too sleek
0o0
That face is kinda terrifying
I know I always talk about car faces but like
Cybertruck at least looks cool
Cybertruck but round
It’s like
It’s about 50 years too early for this
Ew what the hell
<:why:737551606362406982>
This broke my brain a bit
I usually find this sub kinda annoying but damn
i should not be allowed to make emotes
<:why:737551606362406982> <:void:737551678961877032>
he went to the hospital in an ambulance and the bill for that was like $700
last year my dad passed out on the bus home from work due to low blood pressure and a little bit of alcohol
at first i thought it was going to be another covid case and i was like O_O
Alan i'm glad your dad is doing ok now
But who knows I could be wrong
Exactly how kidneys work
That’s not uh
Cant my kidneys grow accustomed to it
Hey if ive been doing it since I was a kid
I vote dying
They could be strong or dying
Well
Bow before my superior kidneys
I’m surprised that jarrett has functioning kidneys at this point
But yeah Jarrett I genuinely don't know how your body gets away with that
He has had blood pressure issues on top of his dieting problems so if we're being realistic here it was probably that and not the Mac and Cheese
idk if I'm even surprised at this point tbh
If i was Alan's dad I would be dead
O_O
Bruh I used to eat plain salt as a child
also have a soy sauce addiction
probably salt my food way too heavily
fr I
<@340319804747415553> Alan's dad has some genes that I'm glad i dont have
Damn, vertigo wasn't a good enough selling point
sorry man this is like the one thing I am genuinely super picky about
Once in a lifetime experience
but this is vertigo inducing Mac and Cheese
if I did I wouldve asked earlier, lol
I don't like cheeeese
<@503787499605458954> wanna try the Mac and Cheese that sent my dad to the hospital
I'm fucking done
IT WASN'T EVEN THAT OVER SALTED
OH MY FUCKING GOD
HE LITERALLY GOT VERTIGO BECAUSE I OVERSALTED THE MAC AND CHEESE
he actually had saline induced vertigo
my dad's on his way home
still fine, no word on my dad yet but that's probably a good thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqds0B_meys
is your dad ok
are you ok??
I CAN'T CONTROL MYSELF
SOMEBODY GET ME THROUGH THIS NIGHTMARE
BUT I'M STILL CAGED INSIDE
SO MANY TIMES I'VE TRIED
I CAN'T ESCAPE THIS HELL
Oof
with him
your mom?
I'm good
You ok?
Oh Jesus
I'm gonna sit in voice chat with a guitar for the time being
the hospital
went to
my dad
Yeah you do, often and happily, and in the words of queen tinashe, ✨get that money hoe✨
I’ll own it
Look man I got lucky with the sugar daddy lottery :p
It already has idk what you're on
That is definitely going down in the annals of this groups history
Lolllll
Jkjkjk
Now blackmail him into getting you a laptop 🤔
Hehe thx 😊
Good on ya ❤️
Wow look at you go hahaha
Yes i have a bf and he cute
I need the tea
Are you not single hm
Ooooooh

there is one now
There’s a ‘single’ tag? I was not aware of this
No idea what that is but you do you
boutta hit noah with the gawk gawk 9000
Go for it bud
*aight bet*
If you were that good then steal him back
u stole my mans
Or at least I think I am
Therefore I’m allowed to speak in this :(
When I started out in this group I was single af
Smh
Is that a problem
Hey
says the one in a relationship
We’re lovable in a non relationship kind of way :)
Lmao
I felt like that was our point of charm in high school
> you know for the number of people in this server we have surprising few people in relationships
We're losers idk what you expected
I only go for twinks
hey jarrett wanna date
I just happen to sleep in the same bed as him occasionally
No
aren't you in a relationship with Jiayi?
Send your application to be my gf/bf below ⬇️
If anyone want to remove their "single" tag
I am a smash player after all
Alan is sad that he doesnt have a loli gf
I'm not sure what to make of this statement
GOOD ONE
YEAH THAT'S SUPER FUNNY
HAHAHAHA
so i wouldnt know
tbf i've hardly ever talked to bethany
or do i not know something
2
um
isnt the number
you know for the number of people in this server we have surprising few people in relationships
im so sorry jarret
well it starts with an A
Who?
Poor you
Bruh
Ah.
I would go hiking but I have 0 energy and my forest pass still hasn't come in the mail T_T
For the next week or so
> It's our houses turn to have our roof replaced
Loud banging that like reverberates through the house from 7 an to 7 pm
I need explanation
How
SUFFERING
I am
Youtube is calling me out on my vtuber binging
Hammer time
It's SO LOUD
This is unbearable
It's our houses turn to have our roof replaced
It works when I wear anything
Hey I already have Alan’s super power
I grant <@!173668455856340994> the power to immediately tell if a person has a foot fetish
why do I have to involuntarily kill things
ok Ive done that but I hate it
where did its spider juices go
AAAAHHHHHH
like a pimple
I FELT IT ON MY LEG AND I JUST PINCHED THE FUCKER OUT OF THIS WORLD
real chad move right htere
I JUST FUCKING KILLED A SPIDER WITH A PINCH
but it's okay, it must be hard not understanding the appeal of camo pants
i modify jarrett's super power for alan: the camo pants become literally invisible so nobody can tell he's wearing camo pants but everyone still thinks he's an asshole
I didn't ask to be attacked like this tonight
wow
I grant <@!478706068223164416> the power to wear camo pants whenever he wants to, but when he does, everyone thinks he's a douchebag
drink it as it falls
projectile vomit it
glug some water
get thirsty
im swimming
that seems really good actually
seems worse for all of yall than for me
I grant <@!110137446053736448> the power to create purified drinking water from any liquid but only by ingesting it and vomiting it back out
I grant <@!110138691388731392> the power to type at 1000 WPM but is always guaranteed to make a single typo in any sentence longer than 5 words
hate you
I grant <@!503787499605458954> the power to listen to music inside her own head, but it has ads every 5 songs
give someone a shitty superpower
thank u
a duet for the ages
WHAT IS CRAAAAAAAAAAWWWWLLL
CRAAAAAAAAAWWLLING
I CRAWWWWWWWWWLLLL
IIS HHHHOOOOOOOOOOOOW
CRAAAAAAWLLLLL
THESE WOUNDS THEY WILL NOT HEAL
CRAWLING IN MY SKIN
Why is this depressing
the masks are obv just too sexy
you wouldnt say that to your spouse?
wait fran
*finger guns*
In style
So yeah hitting on ladies in the Great Depression
98
According to this here chart, if the guy was in poverty during the Great Depression he wouldn't have as much mental energy to hit on ladies:
Or maybe the great depression
he's probably having flashbacks to his youth during the actual roaring 20s
over 100??? 😮
Bonus points for the patient being more than FIVE times older than me
Correction
Just gdi
Gdi
:/
This patient has also tried to ask me to give them a good night kiss in the middle of the afternoon
Me neitherrrrr
i really dont think i would
would *you* say that to your spouse
mmm
So we don’t have firsthand info to draw off of
None of us are married
Who knows
Uhhhhh
do people really say that to their spouses?
:(
._.
That's the most wholesome I can make it
Look I’m nice to all my patients but wtffffff
Maybe hes just losing it and thinks youre his wife
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Me internally: you have dementia and your wife died two months ago
yyeeeeeeeikes
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Me: uh
“When your hands are on me, my blood pressure always goes up”
I was just trying to check his fucking blood pressure and then he was like
I feel gross for getting hit on ngl
Wooooooo.........
fun fun
mmmm
That kind of stuff
Calm yelling patients down
Strip a bed after a patient’s runny shits get everywhere, that’s another
So there’s one
Someone died already
Well
and which have you passed
what other steps are in the initiation?
._.
Bonus points for the guy is more than 4x my age
Get hit on by a patient
Well we hit another career milestone
They are supposed to chase after mice
I mean
Makes sense that the cat would be there
but the chickens would taste so good tho 🤤
I know you mean the eggs
I kid
Don’t eat the chickens
Oh god
they can't really provide comfort but they provide FOOD
time to try chickens
welp there goes my cat owner dreams
I do not recommend it
As someone who’s been to urgent care for getting attacked by a cat
🤭
totally worth it
High risk but also high reward so...
If you roll into a cat, either you’re a goner or the cat is
1. saves money on a cat bed
2. can replace stuffed animals
if i had a cat i would totally want it to sleep in my bed
I kid I kid
Because having a cat would deal with that
Club meetings are every lonely night when you cry yourself to sleep
hehe
Welcome to the club
...
now i really want a cat lol
Tag team
Hell yeah
this guy has two cats who apparently take turns
They have such cute cats
SHE KNOWS WHAT SHES DOIN
That cat looks so smug and content
Hahahaha
speaking of, i was looking for mouse pads on amazon yesterday and I found this review:
His cat was trying to get fed
Sounds quite likely
Lmao
in your case it must have been a keyboard cat
Must of been drunk or somethin
When god made us, his face mashed into the human creation keyboard very similarly for both of us
our outfit matching skills yesterday were legendary
lmfao
We’re so good at it
Unintentional twinning
hey your salt nickname fits perfectly with my slug terrorism
Jokeroooo
Yes.
"medical salt"? isn't that a saline solution?
I didn’t get enough sleep for this
WoooooOooo
So now we gotta pick up the slack but no one else is helping me cover her set
A coworker left in the middle of the day because their drug addict kid beat up their spouse and left her at a Costco with no wallet or phone
Why is my job such a fuckin chaos machine
It was really awesome to see y’all again! Thanks for making it through my COVID interrogation lmao ☺️
It was good to see everyone but my head feels like regret todayyy
bro honestly nights are so short in the summer it's insane
My flip flops turned like dark grey LMFAO
my feet had seaweed still stuck to them oop
Hope we didn't keep you too late <@340319804747415553> love youuu
Today was extremely fun thank you for indulging!!!!
<@193229269076279298> <@340319804747415553> where are you O____O
We were just talking about shaving em
Tbh Alan prob has better legs than me
One of the first fire pits on the sand
Just past it
Nice legs Alan 😍
Relative to the bathhouse?
Where on the beach
Huh
*What*
^
Alan
Who is that?
Weird question
Hmm
I have a box of spare masks if anyone needs
Alan brought a chair
We claimed one or the fire pits lol
We're gonna find a spot on the sand
I just saw a wheeley office chair in a bus stop booth
We are like on a street a few blocks up
I am somewhere under a bridge
Wya
Just arrived
Noah and I are here already
The bridge on the usual route is closed so it will take almost an hour to get there
I'm at Alan's house
A bit later than originally planned actually lmfao
So we’re leaving earlier now?
Yes I will bring le speaker
Cough noah
Also <@193229269076279298> <@340319804747415553> update grabbing Alan at 7:30 instead eta 8:15ish?
Helen can you bring your Bluetooth speaker
I'm bringing a picnic mat and beach towels
But then how are you getting home
That sounded bad but you know what I mean
I’m coming but my parents are dropping me off so y’all can do whatever you want in the car lol
Y’all should bring blankets so we can sit on the beach :p
A valiant sacrifice
I'll mask myself in car if that's all it takes for you to come
There are some protests around but I’ve only encountered them closer to downtown
I've driven through a few times and everything seems fairly normal
Alan and Fran have been going back and forth all the time, Salina lives in the u district now
Violence is greatly reduced compared to early June, if you're talking about the protest situation, and mostly confined to cap hill when protests do happen
I don't think so?
isn't seattle pretty unsafe rn
Which is the direction of the comet
Plus, it faces northweat
lol
I searched up best stargazing spots near Seattle lol
not covid related question but why alki?
On the bright side if your parents have the time, it's gonna be a spectacular sunset and hopefully a good view of the comet???
So like
But it's also a weeknight so I feel kinda bad, I'm willing to wear a mask in the car and willing to bet Alan is too. Can put you in the backseat further from us? Though my car kinda small
If covid is a serious concern it might be best for your parents to take you, bc while the only people I've like been close to are the 3 I listed, I've been grocery shopping etc and going out fairly regularly, idk how worrying that is
alan already talked to the hooker there
try the red light district
yo where is hoe depot
I'm probably staying home anyway
Wondrous
lmfao
Hoe depot
We've been in ho.e depot and Lowe's today
<@!478706068223164416> <@!110137446053736448>  sorry to bother but 1) have you guys been in contact with non-family ppl in the last two weeks and 2) would you be willing to wear a mask in the car? It's ok if you don't; my parents are willing to drive me
anything for money i guess
well i guess you gotta go back
its terrible
oh gosh you went crawling back lmao
I gave up and sent in my application to chipotle
damn rip
I have not
and he wants to not roll more burritoes
he already worked there before
What's wrong w chipotle
have you found a non-chipotle job yet
ty for your contribution matthew
Big groddy
i feel like i havent talked to you in a hot ass sec
bethany how you doin, gal
indeed
Groddy.
That sucks sorry
But
> SEE THE WORLD
> but through a shitty dusty windshield
Already do whenever I drive LMAO
rant over
because that's how the face shield looks after like an hour
Uh
SEE THE WORLD
but through a shitty dusty windshield
do you guys ever wish you could like
Go off
ok sorry i need to like mini rant real quick
>.<
now what would kill me is wearing a face shield for more time
not to say i definitely can't go otherwise; my parents could drive me and i'll just stay 6 feet away from you guys
a few more hours wont kill me
Yeay
i do that at work anyway haha
oh yeah sure
sorry i ask about this so much, but would y'all be willing to wear masks tonight?
fuck swabs
Alan's also been tested
it's a lot of swabs :/
ive tested 3 times
*also Salina's been tested a bunch and never came up positive
i also volunteer on two swedish hospital campuses
in THEORY none have covid
i work with residents
And I hung out w abhay at lake sammamish, but outdoors only w masks
I was with Alan and Fran last week
i have covid question -- have you guys (especially whoever is in cindy's car) been around non-family people in the last two weeks?
But this is prob the last week it'll be visible to naked eye
Friends in Vancouver tell me they could see it right after sunset? So hopefully you'll still get a look, if not the weekend maybe
Rip
... how willing am i to sleep deprive myself for the next day
I might do other trips Thurs/Fri/Sat nights to other places i.e. Snoqualmie, Rainier but today is ez mode bc this was a very impulse decision
I can't go but have fun guys!
Comet should be visible around 10
> when are you guys planning on going home?
<@472541429130854421> probably ~11 if that works for other people
Also I'm still thinking about whether or not I'm goin
that's when i usually go to sleep now ._.
i want to get home by 9:30-10:00
Not from apt
I'm unclear on whether Alan and Fran are coming from apt or home
No
when are you guys planning on going home?
alan and fran from their apartment?
sounds like helen from her house
I wanna get there at ~8-8:30 if that's ok
Wait okay @everyone who am I picking up from where
Yes!!!!!!!
i mean if im not in cindy's car anymore there should be a spot :)
do you guys possibly have space for one more person?
to pup or not to pup, that is the question
hm.
i mean we could also like do the kind of parent thing where it's like "no you take them i'm off to do fun things for a bit" and just rotate off spending time w the group sometimes
Up to you
but hercccc
Rip
:(
yea, that would kinda section us off from everyone else
do you want me to bring Herc to walk?
id say bring herc but that'd end badly
Yeah do you wanna grab Salina then? Lol
love you babe
<3
yay my chauffeur bitch
Wait this is lit I expected it to just be me lmfao
!!!
I can go
lol
yes.
No
put me in the trunk
If I'm taking all 3 of you it might be a bit cramped but sure
im just a hotass mess
this is what adulting has done to me
._.
i'm too lazy to park
tbh could i get a ride
work is a-callin my name
i just gotta be back by like... 9:45 at the latest
and i do have a car
i can prob go
oh
<@110137446053736448> wanna go?
YAAAAY
Sure!!
Fran and I will be at our apartment in a bit, I'd be down but would probably need a ride
Right, heading to alki beach tonight probably at around 8, hmu if anyone wants to come
I'm gonna go comet hunting this week
I think
But anyways
Thinking bout what I gave up lmfao
IM SAD
Damn discord fucks w the pic a bit
I hate that their lights are still on
I'm satisfied for now
That's the best I can get with all the bleed from Skyline
Wooooow
30s per pic does take a while though
I'll see if I can get a shot for the both of us
Lol
My real camera is out of battery T_T
This is more dedication than I thought I originally had
I got my real camera out
Kiiiinda wanna sneak out and go stargazing now it's perfectly clear for the first time in a while
ta ta
so ima just go to bed
i cant figure out how to photograph stars with my phone
Not bad for a smartphone
Raw photo manually developed
Keep their yard light on 24/7 for no reason smh
Our neighbours behind us
Bc I can see it
Damn I'm tryna get the big dipper
30s might be long enough for the earth's rotation to mess up the point light of stars
Shitty ass resolution bc I don't have a mini tripod or anything to prop onto and cannot remain still
yay?
I can see stars out my window
Yikes. This isn’t even counting the 8+ hours I spend on my laptop
Sike
and the 2nd is a bit of a meme
in case it wasn't clear
2 completely different songs
We now have two people who listen to that kinda music and know the lyrics
Oh man
lol
bottems up when i first meetcha'
you was at the club
...............damn, you know i hate the club // 
but I came 'cause I knew you'd show up
https://twitter.com/TSM_Leffen/status/1281721339691204608?s=19
Bitte
Ja
Please send your prayers
I’m currently watching a 90 old man who’s now tried to hit 3 nurses and trying to speak to him in broken German
I'm not trying to sleep yet but damn it's 3 am can people stop setting off fireworks lmfao
Feels weird as hell that 1968 is as close as 2072
🙃
both
do you have a lot of stuff in there or is it just kinda badly proportioned?
that's weird
but it doesn't really fit two cars well
ok it's actually "two car"
damn
oh really?
yea but we only have a one car garage
s m h  I don't have a long ass driveway
pfff, rich people problems
yeaaaaah
lol you park your car inside?
the main issue is just the garage door is loud as fuck
maybe if I find some excuse to park outside one of these days
lol
the only answer is to do them in first then
parents would kill me :c
I've gone driving at night just because before
do you need an excuse?
I really wanna have an excuse to go drive somewhere in the middle of the night
It's been incessant for 2 full days
Yep, and at the end of the vid
do you mean the sound at 0:08 - 0:10?
I need to get earplugs this is literally unbearable
SIR/MA'AM WHY DID YOU FEEL THE NEEF TO START BANGING AROUND AGAIN AT 6 AM
https://photos.app.goo.gl/69ALszbjzVbFL7J9A
Hey you could very well try
> Theory: Masochism can be applied to headaches
God I wish
Take your pick?
Theory: Masochism can be applied to headaches
Theory: It's possible to train your brain to ignore headaches
Theory: You can cure a headache by having it faster
Spend a little time experimenting and see what happens
Well, it could, but you're already hurting anyways
Can't hurt to try
I mean, maybe?
Or are you just making shit up
Is this bs you learned in psych
If you can somehow convince yourself that headaches are a pleasurable experience you'll suffer less
Ààaaaaaaaå
I want: todie
I have empathy but I chose to ignore it on this occasion
itll come back threefold but still
itll put off the headache for a while
how about you play games for about 2 hours
this is where i question whether or not you have empathy or not 🤔
An exercise in will power and self control
Could be good mental training
I'll pass
Uh
Worst case scenario you still have the headache but you're really going in on it instead of being frustrated by it
Convince yourself you've always had this headache
Focus on it and relish in it
Like try getting really into having that headache
Have you considered staring out the window and just focus on having the headache
Yeah I can't sleep
That's quite the headache
Ihavethe worst headache but no idea where my Advil is somewhere in these boxes 😔
So good
Basically a highly concentrated lemonade
I’ve eaten lemon slices marinated in honey
I judge you for eating 5 cans of canned oranges in a row
but <@110138691388731392> judges me for eating oranges, so I can't really expect anything better from him
I like eating lemon slices occasionally
wack
yea but like just lemon
Lemon juice is useful for like everything
yea
decorate?
what the hell else are you supposed to do with em
who the fuck just eats lemons
i thought the obvious reason was that peeling a lemon makes it harder to zest
Okay Noah I though the quite obvious reason is that people don't eat whole ass slices of lemon
but the skin just doesn't separate nicely
I like eating lemons
yeah I'm w Noah on this one there is a reason and it is quite obvious
> why do we peel oranges but not lemons
wtf
i didn't mean to type that
bruh
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
yall dont peel lemons?
I mean, we would if we actually ate them
*have you ever tried to peel a lemon*
why do we peel oranges but not lemons
ain't it crazy how I can just type a combination of words into a computer and it'll go around sassing people
we should go out for dim sum sometime
you ever think about how we haven't seen each other face to face in actual months
kinda crazy how none of us asked to be born
i need to consult with the high council
*maybe*
is that a mother fucking jojo reference
**gio**
i dont need my jojo to be tainted by this garbaggio 😠
also why am i getting so many ads for valorant on crunchyroll
it's garbage
I HOPE YOU ENJOYED BREATHING WHILE YOU HAD IT
WELCOME TO ALLERGY GANG
now my nose itches like all hell and i am high sad
19 years and never had any allergy issues
Maybe ISTP
as for the rest it's up to interpretation
he's very susceptible to mood swings
since he only responds to external stimuli as far as his brain goes, wouldn't that make him S?
basically everyone reaches out to him to get him involved
it's true that Starbot is the kind of person that doesn't reach out to others
mmm okay
have you tried shutting up recently?
<@!556987075308814346> what say you
Not a person, no cognition etc
But like
If I *had* to, INTP
Uhhhhhhhh
<@!503787499605458954> <@!472541429130854421> this might be fruitless but if you had to type Starbot, what would he be

okay that stuff isn't usually in a character sheet

stats would be all the axis we talked about
basically imagine something like this but for each one of us
took this from r/Hololive
like those cheesy ones they have in manga
each member would have their own profile page or whatever
I was seriously considering making the WD profile engine
this one where he cooks with a chainsaw is pretty good

i am un mess
when i'm tired
alignment chart
in general sure
in general, I mean
i'm reining it in shhh
you're not that chaotic tbh
god i'd hate to be me when sloshed
this is me when i'm tired
too much chaos seeping out
ok i really gotta sleep now
fake ally smh
you're clearly not really sorry lmao
oh fuck wait that was unintentional LOL
ms is a gendered term
I know better now ms. angery sewer
sincerely apologize for ignoring your preferred pronouns
i feel very attacked
you are being so insensitive right now
I see
i personally identify as an attack helicopter
wasn't talking to you are you an "it'???
pleases me
i better have a snatched body
this....
bitch if i'm a sewer sludge
needs more sludge
hope you're happy fran
it has too much of a body
aight angery it is
I was picturing massive and terrifying though
huh you kinda right
is that not like the new w101 boss
**ANGERY**
with like sewer bars as a mouth
but is it angry or *angery*
I'm thinking of a video game sludge monster
cindy what do you think
...
angery sewer
what about
am angry sewer
r h e t o r i c
it alliterates so it must be true and important
salty seamstress
what about
went from being a trashcan fire to being a sewer
yeah that's the point
I 100% read that as sewer as in like sewer drains
which means i'm an angry sew-er
I got distracted by my own video whoops
i was pissed last night so i tailored my scrubs
no <:oroRage:554196355275292672>
use the discord overlay
yall made my game crash from alt tabbing so much <:oroRage:554196355275292672>
so yall know i sew
oh
friend is prioritized
why are you an angry sewer now
what if your friend is a first responder
it alliterates so it must be important and true
Friends > First Responders
maybe let the ER know first
well
will do
let us know when you've lopped off your first knuckles
well
or that
have decent spatial awareness?
yeah just hide my fingertips
> onions are like one of the easiest things to chop imo
also I said this but I just remembered that the only time I've cut myself in the kitchen was w an onion
so just
ive learned the technique to not lop off my fingertips when cutting things with a giant knife
bc I never use a whole onion at once
same
especially when it's just me
usually I do too tbh
who needs precision
i just attack it w a knife
oh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwRttSfnfcc
wait
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt1u6N7lueM
onions are like one of the easiest things to chop imo
I think you could verbally walk someone through mincing an onion
lmao
so 2 ways
which means you also know how to make scrambled eggs
correct
if you can fry an egg, that means you can mess up frying an egg
so the best way!
i can fry an egg <@!503787499605458954>
like I can tell Fran how to bread a chicken thigh but not to mince an onion
it's a dish that's more technique than precision
if I had Fran cooking for me I'd make him do the Katsu
that was a dud egg of a pun
smh
it sure *spiced* up the conversation
lol thank you for the energy
that's enough chaos energy for the night
raw egg yolk as a topping on noodles....... *chefs kiss*
alright i should go sleep
eggcelent examples
I had a raw egg over rice in Japan
well, subjectively
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWAagS_MANg
there's literally no incorrect way to cook an egg
also incorrect there's like infinite ways to make eggs
the asphalt in yellowstone
which one
and i only know 1
the clothes iron
i thought there was like 4 ways to make an egg
look man just pull out all the random heated appliances
... eggregious amount of trust
but can he cook an egg all 30 ways
seems like an
therefore I trust him with my life
fran told me he can cook an egg
gave up on life
yeah I know you've known how to cook longer than me looool
it's 20 degrees cooler in this shade
i had a master chef obsession phase where i like peaked and then like
ok tbf i can cook pretty competently
LMFAO
ok I was gonna reassure you that it wasn't about you and it wasn't at first but now I'm questioning that
lol cooking
i say, as a person who is barely motivated to eat on a regular basis
you can trust me :p
...
though
some people
if I trust
idk
yo that'd be lit
what if we wore blindfolds and instructed someone else to cook our dish for us
so me
oh
I wanna do this Food Wars style
good question lol
then who should judge
booooo
let's have all the people on the Eat to Live side of the spectrum judge
cookoff sounds fun
lol
👀
you'd be surprised how good I am at coercing meat into shapes
we gotta have a cookoff sometime
ground beef and an egg would probably hold its shape well enough
have fun bud
lmao cooking as a third wheel
I feel like ground beef would fall apart
ill be cooking with my bro and his gf tuesday tho
n-n-n-not y-y-yet
we'll try with ground beef
ehhh
i mean
well when you cut it open
have you been cooking fran? you said you were gonna pick up a thing or two
not if I cover it with enough panko lol
it'd probably be good but look weird
sounds good to me
kinda wanna try using beef one time to see how it turns out
I know
it's the same process with a porkchop lol
answer is probably "yeah of course stupid" but it can't hurt to check
Ive done chicken katsu but not pork
I'll have to see if my mom knows how to make thai curry
would that satisfy?
to like, 95% faithfulness
I can do a pork katsu over curry
yo alan think you can replicate some CoCo Ichibanya?
next one I wanna recreate is this INCREDIBLE curry-katsu-udon I got like 2 weeks ago
mostly just bc a single squash for a single person is like 5 servings LMAO
ohohoho
3 or 4 times now
I've made this like
https://hot-thai-kitchen.com/red-curry-chicken-squash/
and some parts of WA are in stage 2 but some are also seeing a rise in cases again so things are still murky
ok similar situation here actually Ive been working on trying to replicate some of my fave dishes
it was then I realized I could actually recreate the best stuff I've ever had if I did it right
probably that time I finally cooked Hamburg Steak completed with a red wine reduction sauce that came within punching distance of the same dish I had in Roppongi Hills, Tokyo
oh god that's hard uh
isn't wa state technically stage 2 now
fave thing you've learned to make?
I forget we're in quarantine too
quarantine really did make me learn how to cook all my cravings
but the answer is yes
🙃
I was gonna respond anyways you happened to @ me
thing is my dad modified his burger so much it was 33$
(is she a demon)
i paid for our dinner
(she responded the same time I mentioned her)
tipsy cow strongly suggested them
molly moons required masks
spooky
kinda sketchy
tell the border guards you're my family
a luxury that <@!503787499605458954> is getting to enjoy ALL THE TIME NOW AND I'M NOT JEALOUS ONE BIT
tipsy cow was allowing in-house
i had the option too
yeah but SITTING DOWN in a RESTAURANT
but we took takeout
i did that today
remember going out to eat? That shit was mad fun
damn we really did go out to eat twice a week
let's not ignore the fact that you wore the same sweater to Bian Dumpling House and Hokkaido Ramen Santouka
I swear to god half the time I posted a food snap the second half would be you
it's fucking uncanny
because you love me
like seriously
and for some reason <@!110137446053736448> shows up 1 in every 5 posts
lots of good stuff happened there
I'm a little late to the party but I guess I missed my dorm
it just seems... so... long ago?
I was running through my old snap stories and I came across stuff from my old dorm
Return to normalcy
Mildly questioning as to how that's comforting
I'm annoyed bc there are drunk students yelling outside but also oddly comforted that there's drunk students yelling outside again

Tell them a random stranger is offering them a virtual hug
Sorry to hear about your friend, that’s incredibly shitty on their end
Come visit me tooooo, I move in first week of July
Plus if our apartment lease finally begins you can come over for a bit if your parents drive you crazy

yes and conditions are getting better but it's still messy
Are there resources in India for LGBTQ groups or have they all been eradicated
India, okay now I see your concern
there is no easy way to put this but I'm freaking out bc he lives in india and his parents might actually send him to conversion therapy man
That's the kinda person you are, after all
As long as he has someone like you to support him I can guarantee he'll be fine
Can't say much on the academia front besides you've come back from worse and I know you can pull it off
I mean??? I guess???? but idk what's gonna happen to him anymore
Good for your friend though, at least he won't have to hide anything now
pretty much
Lol that's a lot
aaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAA
so I'm just
also I was doing super well but then kinda bombed the last quiz/exam in both classes I'm taking right now and I have finals next week
idk if I should be spilling all of that but there's that on the emotional front
also, one of my best friends came out as gay to his parents thinking they'd be accepting but they told him he's sick and needs help and he's been a mess the past few days and I'm honestly scared what they're gonna do to him and also that's like one of my biggest fears personally
both

Couldn’t be decisive about toast smh
Wouldn’t be so sure if I were you
Hm

Do you have dementia

Are you 90?
uncharacteristic of me to turn down food of any kind but honestly probably not
idk
Would you like some toast
and maybe for the rest of the year
kinda just wanna sleep again
I'm stressed and depressed!
Noast
sooo did they end up picking toast?
Yes.
that sounds like you're coming from experience
This makes me more confused than a 90 year old dementia patient trying to figure out whether they want to eat more toast or not

i hate going braless
I would love to go braless more often but society says female nipples are indecent
Unfortunately no

so sometimes ill put my hand on my chest
i sleep shirtless a lot
absolutely
Do you guys forget you have nipples sometimes or is that just me
I hesitate to even call it a conversation
What the fuck was this convo
Your sins are catching up to you
IVE BEEN AWAKE FOR SO LOMG WHY CANT I SLEEP

You ever wonder if cows can orgasm from their udders
That's just the stuff under the foreskin
*Human cheese*
Take for instance
You can do things with cow milk that's kinda weird with our own tit milk
Humans are weird cos when we're adults we prefer to drink cow tit milk rather than our own tit milk
You gotta wonder sometimes how many people pissed out the water you're drinking

I can rest now
It's nearly 4 am and I finally killed the damn thing by dropping a crate of books on it
So update
so I opened the windowand now werehere
I was asleep she called me at like 10:40 and woke me up and now I can't sleep
but she also kinda forcibly reset my sleep schedule for me so it balances out
I slightly blame my mom for this
geez noah
idk, possibly seems like an upgrade over normal
how sad is my life
I literally put on my sunglasses at 12 am to stare directly at the ceiling light to monitor for this HUGE ASS BUG

the head get eaten
ew
nice
watch
https://imgur.com/gallery/PZYxru5#KjFwVVv
it keeps crawling inside the lamp so i can't kill it and then coming out and freakiing me out by throwing itself against the plastic outside bit while buzzing really loudly
noah YOU'RE NOT HELPING
they can lose their head and still keep moving
than a brain
it's more a nervous system hub
well
like how stupid can you be smh
do bugs have brains
jk it's very much alive and banging itself against the light again
mom wanted food so I had to leave for a little
what a poetic way to die
hopefully it crawled into the light and died??
so uh
but also idk where it went
ok Ive stopped panickinig upon research I think it's just a hoverfly
REST IN PEACE 🤣 🤣 🤣
rip
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
good luck
uhhhh
LMAOOOOO
uh
lol
REST IN PEACE 🤣 🤣 🤣
it has stripes
well that's less exciting
oh
I didn't realize you wer einto him lkike that
I actually think it's a wasp
fuuuuuck me
i think i still have the picture too
twas good
that shit mad funny
I REMEMBER YOU WERE LIKE WTF AND I WAS LIKE LMAO
LMAO I DO
i need some hydrogen peroxide
that hasn't washed out
and it left a giant bloodstain on my white shorts
yo alan remember when i smacked that mosquito at fuji
when I killed it it was on the white countertop and it left behind a green stain mark
aight I'll be back after I've murdered it I'm gonna look for a weapon
and I forgot it's actually warm now hence they aren't dead anymore
by the way this is only an issue bc the fucking windows on campus don't have netting
OK BUT IT'S OVER MY BED
used a kitchen towel as a whip
ooh I killed a big fly yesterday
and it's like banging its head against the light on my ceiling
I thought it was a moth at first but it's definitely either a wasp or a large fly
are wasps attracted to light?
but that hurts enough
ive only ever been bit by a wasp
c'mon cin you're a veteran outdoorswoman
no it actually looks like it might be a wasp
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7VMcMJBjD4
bare hands
would I break down in tears if a wasp stung me or is that just the childhood trauma
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
bruh I like don't have anything to kill it with
from what ive seen on the great YT its very unlikely there's a giant hornet colony here in the US
like, actually
does it hurt
I've never been stung
normal wasps
murder hornets
with how often we've been eating out there im both annoyed and unsurprised
how big
there've been wasps buzzing about my backyard lately
sounds like a summer bug
hmm
FUCK ME THERE IS
IS THERE A BUG
THERE WAS JUST SOME LOUD AS SHIT BUZZING IN MY ROOM
virome being a pen company
I was never gonna actually try to do the concept-matching based answer stuff lol I just wanted to share a little of the design process
same reason many spanish speakers will say *virome* instead of *lapizera*
lol "containment strategy" am I talking about starbot or the soviet union
branding; coca cola is probably the most popular soda out there, most widely known at least so people just associate fizy drinks with cola
I get your point which is why I said just do the containment strategy bc w my minimal CS knowledge I can tell trying to figure out word patterns for concepts for him to learn would be way more work
though he gets pretty far on that alone
lmao
We should get help
<@!470822754262712329>
he sees the patterns which they're put together
he sees strings of characters
starbot doesn't understand concepts
cola is a specific kind of soda so idk why people use them as synonyms
but that's basically the issue I'm trying to illustrate, the conceptually correct answer
soda
soda gang
that's standard for the pnw
right?
we all say soda
"pop" "soda" "cola"
im pretty sure tehre's a 0% brit population here
if we're crossing dialect boundaries is that they arent
in america chips and fries are different tho
or specifically ordering fish n chips
chips and fries are not the same thing unless you're a brit
> would fran still be correct?
yes but also no??
starbot's not smart enough to know that "chips" and "fries" are the same thing yet
otherwise we're gonna have to start looking into character match %
😠
we're gonna operate under the assumption that words are spelled correctly
would börger be accepted?
hmmmmm
would fran still be correct?
and fran answered "double cheeseburger"
if my answer was "burger"
okay one more case
yeah thats what I thought hoe
and how would you standardize "conceptually matching answers"?
because that's less of a headache
I decide to do the answer contains the answer solution
that would be harder to make though wouldn't it
there's also conceptually matching answers though, like "Apple Pie" and "Cherry Pie"
excuse my illiteracy
containing this question
i did not see this bullet point
if we write the questions we could keep that in mind
not perfect obviously but it's workable
> if one answer contains the other?
think this is the best simple solution
thats what he's asking lol
yeah but how do you code the correctness of a short response
the questions would be like "Alan walks into a McDonalds. What does he order?"
t/f would be kinda boring though
or do we throw in a short response question and see what % of words they get right
3. how do we handle the flow of the game? when does Starbot wait for answers? when does he calculate the end scores?
all t/f questions yes?
2. how do we handle the "correctness" of an answer? matching character by character? if one answer contains the other?
1. where do the questions come from? a bank? a pool of server-specific questions that the users write?
it's just a few design details that need working out
depending on how much effort I put into it I could probably do it in 30-90 minutes
wait that'd be so fun
the more questions you're able to answer correctly the better your friendship score
then Starbot would ask the participants each question, and their goal would be to provide what they think the original person answered
they would answer the 10 questions
the idea would be Starbot chooses 10 questions for someone to answer
yea but like three monitors blaring at least a normative ("ought to k2

https://quizlet.com/AlanWen/folders/69614667/sets

you guys
petition to fix the japanese language

I spent 15 seconds trying to figure out what *arumikan* meant
if you say so
hm
carry on
nothing important
what'd i miss
what happened?
GOD DAMMIT HELEN
SHIT IT'S SPREADING
thank you
can you undo that edit please
i do not like that edit
one of these things is not like the others
completely unrelated
at least you'll be light
naked and afraid
and therefore how you approach fights and the game in genera
creativity in ds is all about how you build your character
just for that cool crit animation
ye
I tested an all crit attack speed Vel build
is the same kind of creativity you find in dark souls
you make it sound like Animal Crossing would suit you then
i would say
cause creativity in league
well i set league apart
but I should mention a separate category just for games I play with friends
you can be very creative in league of legends
bc I was confused how that fit into almost anything else Ive seen him play or talk about
and why I asked
LOL
agree
but by the same logic i feel like legal legos is not a good candidate for his type of game
true
well yeah but not in the way I think he means
you can be plenty creative in ds
i keep needing to remind myself that it's not the ghibli miyazaki
like people won't play it because they think it's gonna make them frustrated and quit?
ok interesting that's really not what I look for in a game
do you think ds gets misunderstood
I believe Miyazaki approves of my essay topic
*noah*
...............
~~big anime titties~~ anything where I can be creative and do stupid stuff
i can understand that honestly
L
booooooooooooooooooooooo
my brother passed up on playing ds1 for free cause he said he'd probably just get too frustrated
:p
lots of robots
robots
whats your type of game then
but also very not my type of game
they seem cool
1027 hours across all dark souls games, 611 of those in DS3
I have only played to the first boss in Dark Souls 2(?)
lmao
ezpz lemon squeezi
just write down some item descriptions
( trash panda has found many stan members to be among )
laughs in long buried trauma
lmao
lol i talked about chinese school textbooks in mine
of a 5-7 page essay
( dark souls stan trash panda has entered the chat )
3-5 page draft
ooooooooooooooooooooh
in my life to fit this assignment
I expect the line to be just a little before "lorem ipsum solor idet amet"
that's the same as my first assignment
cause its honestly the best thing
WAIT WOAH
im writing about dark souls
I've always wondered how little I can get away with in a "draft"
drafts you say
👍
which knowing myself it wont take that long
cause that really means by 8 or 9 am
so that's why i say technically midnight
cause he wants to be able to email these rough drafts out to the appropriate groups by 8 or 9 am
prof insisted getting this one on time
then that just encourages things like noah's crackhead sleep sched
i mean
lmao
honestly they should just make things due at like 5:59 AM
i hate that
oh god
due tonight do tonight
*you get what i mean*
well by LT i just mean assigned ahead of time
i have never done a LT assignment the night before it was due
but only strategically
i have procrastinated
don't lie to yourself lassie
you say that like you've never procrastinated before
gl dude
question your life choices
but i also uh
you got this
YOU GOT THIS
i gots this
technically tonight at midnight
when is the assignment due
so fran
uhhhhh
:))
like right now
i have it in procrastination-fueled bursts
...sometimes
I have motivation
I only got like 3 chapters left though
I know it's probably the most beneficial thing for my learning ever since I started on my own but it just takes so long to pencil in each and every word I don't know
I wanna keep reading this volume of Hitoribocchi in Japanese but this one volume has taken me several months to get through
that's not unreasonably happy
you know
hahahaha
I get unreasonably happy when it rains because it means I don't have to water my hundreds of flowers
how was reading in bed
lmao
I feel attacked
no me means me
how's the animal crossing life treating you
or do you mean "me"
population: you
welcome to no motivation zone
That’s actually kinda cute that skyline is doing this
Holy shit that's awesome haha
LMAO
YARD SIGNS
lol, we got one
what yard signs!!!
honestly the power move would be make a grad cap out of the yard sign
They should've given us yard signs instead
Fuck prom and graduation
the fuck
what?
bruh LMAO
They get YARD SIGNS
yeah but
those were probably some of my favorite memories from high school and it's kinda depressing to think they'll be without them for their entire lives
their prom and graduation got canceled
current mood is feeling bad for the seniors
you'll see a few things he can do
DM him with the !mathhelp command
I wrote some vector math stuff for math class and gave it to him
I didn't put any thought towards how he'd fare if he had to serve thousands or hundreds of thousands of servers, or how to host him once my Amazon student budget is used up
why can he do vector mathematics?
sure anyone can invite him to their server, but for the most part he's only in about 4 servers
but one thing's always been constant through all that: he's a private bot
In fact I can almost guarantee he's the only one with all those features
again, creating a bot like Starbot is no joke (even though I treat it like one), not many bots on Discord are written in Java, can play music, host polls, do vector mathematics, play Spotify playlists on YouTube, and create neural network natural language models
for that reason, I'm interested in whether there's anything in it for me to create a real, polished, public, and supported bot
like, I could surgically remove any of his core features (music, commands, mathematics, spotify) and give it to another bot really easily
but he's extremely modular and easy to pick apart and put back together
if I had to describe Starbot in terms of polish, he's got about 4 different layers of paint on him and you can kinda see it cracking in places
this has me wondering if I should actually try and make a *polished* bot for public use
"The future for bots is bright, and as you can see, it looks a little different from what you’re used to. We’ll be hard at work this year making bots and applications a first class part of the Discord ecosystem, as they should be."
it basically says they're working to make bots more integrated into Discord, moreso than they already are
this article was posted about a week ago on Discord's blog
https://blog.discord.com/the-future-of-bots-on-discord-4e6e050ab52e
rip
idk felt like the channel that needed a little activity
good?
isn't that
why is this sad boi hours
for all the shit I give Starbot he's actually a pretty fleshed out bot
this means I'll be here all night
today is Tuesday
Wack
Aye my power's back but WiFi is not
I have a nice lunch break every day tho
My first foray into 8:30 am classes
Nice!!
at least i got all the classes i wanted!
i woke up because noises aka my alarm
But now I'm like Super aeake
I just woke up bc noises
I got back to sleeping 12-2 am
I did
also didn't you "fix" your schedule?
Well I'm about to put on some music and lights and dance
what do you do all night
I assume they're trying to fix whatever happened
Shit is so fucking loud outside
Tbf I would sleep if I could
Mood Jarrett
wow being awake at 4 am is a unique experience
noah seems to be online
I can't wait to hate myself tomorrow morning
Wouldn't be surprised if Noah and maybe Jiayi are also up
wow it scares me that two of you are online now
Yikes
Oh
registration
You're like the last person I expected to respond lmao
Why are you still awake
lol
I was wondering why my internet wasn't working apparently my power's out @_@
WHAT THE HELL
Oh
It sounds like someone has been revving a truck outside my window for the past like 30 mins I wanna die
because he should stay inside
why not both?
irl or animal crossing?
"I GOTTA WATER MY FLOWERS"

My mom might need to get surgery
Mentally becoming a panicked chicken
Physically yes

Ahhhhhh
Just screaming
External screaming
Internal screaming
on the bright side i can now go skiing on weekdays!!!
L
my whistler shuttle got cancelled and I am Extra Sad
but god DAMMIT I'm better than this
luckily Discord detected it before anyone else and refreshed it for me so nothing bad happened
meanwhile I'm coming to terms with the fact that I accidentally leaked Rin's token to GitHub
that's the cindy I know
haha
me: I can't watch a movie I have class
also me: gets lost on asian youtube for an hour and a half
just 2 weeks before the next update thatll jsut wipe it all
ooh i can rename all my shit in ror2
every mode is jojo mode
😠
if you're bored just sleep or smth KEKW
appreciate the offer tho
not in jojo mode right now
starting from whereever you are right now
<@!110137446053736448> I could watch some jojo's with you
ok i figured out which server i can use :thonk: in
:thonk:
yeah
you mean early tomorrow?
that doesn't sound like something that'd stop you normally
sis what
I still have class T_T
yeah
right now?
hmmm
anyone wanna watch a movie or something
So one, hundred
gtocha
Baak is a hundred
test me
thought you were trying to throw out random numbers
gotcha
you're saying how to say 100
OH
oh
100 is a k noise
No no
or i have never heard it right
either sifu says it wrong
hm
It's definitely a k noise
Ah
for 1 and 8
i think of it as yaht and baht
Sorry
Different tone I believe
1 8, jarrett?
my dad was just complaining about it
yup
They really went and cancelled the NBA on me didnt they
And man
For Fran
Yaat baak
Oops
In Korean
3-8
I think I can count from like
Grats man
no idea what 100 is
i can confidently count to 99 in cantonese
I both really miss and don’t miss taekwondo
oh and counting
we just learn that one stance, form names, and some punches in chinese
We learned the kicks in Korean at higher ranks
Most of the naming I learned was English
interesting
p sure its cantonese
we call that (and pardon my spelling cause i really just cant) yiji (?) stance
okay yeah
it's like horse stance but turned sideways and less hard on knees
it might just be a naming thing
oh man the diffs in martial arts education comes out
the fuck is that
side stance?
but i'd agree they're usually harder
and thats just uncomfortable
cause most of the weights on one leg
i dont like other stances
but who knows what shenanigans you're getting up to
i think bc horse stance is prob one of the easier stances in my xp
that's fair
its applicable to my life
why sad
That seems like a kinda sad way to kill your legs
?
O_o
Wait what
fuck i ogtaa pradtice more
and killing my legs with horse stance
Quality
Lmao
but instead i go from playing smash to watching smash
Ora Ora bitches
ゴゴゴゴゴ
Jojo lore is weird
ゴゴゴゴゴ
speaking of which i should continue with jojo
probably dio
Who could it be
Or was it dio
that is a thonk
for the uninitiated
I think starbot might be at work
wtf
Lmao
:thonk:
FOR A SPLIT SECOND
IT FLASHED A THONK
WHAT
:thonk:
Well guess you’re better off wiping your ass on a dingo
Not having toilet paper?
i saw on reddit that australia has been having ths problem for some time now
She was like wtf I have to fight people for things
hmm
MY MOM TOO
YEAH
*in costco*
people shitting their pants so mcuh over corona my mom couldnt find any toilet paper
Exactly
Wearing the mask if you aren’t sick doesn’t really accomplish anything
It only really works if the sick person wears the mask
coronavirus spreads easily just by breathing, even when the infected person is not coughing
but it only works because *everyone* is wearing masks, including everyone who has the virus even before symptoms appear
it's true that community spread in china has decreased due to everyone wearing masks
And she's like 'but look how it is in china, it's so scary we gotta prepare. everybody in china wears face masks' no last I checked we don't live in china
'but this girl's parent told me this story' ughhhhhh
Been sending her credible sources about the whole face mask shortage issue and about the myths/panic stories made to take advantage of people's fears
And I'm like stop please
And telling me to take these big doses of vitamin C everyday
Bought a big-ass pack of masks
My mom hearing 'counter-measures' against covid-19 from her circle/community of parent friends
:((((
I just wanna get some networking in
honestly a lot of clubs in the US are 18+ we just can't drink legally, which I honestly don't care about much, but bc there's much less of a gap everything gets lumped in to 19 here which is Rather Unfortunate
Enjoy your underage revelry in the USA only apparently
Sigh
IRSA knows I'm a freshman so like.... yeah 19 is believable 21 is not
Oki
Well.
................
oh it's nothing terrible lol just I have a US fake but I don't think it'd pass muster up here
What laws did you break this time
Bitch
What have you done
Oh god Cindy
From,
The gubermint
welllllll
Thanks for not doing fraudulent things
Well
Ah
I decided it was a bad idea at the time and now I really regret it
Convincing fake ID you were gonna get
What happened to this uh
Ah
I'm GENUINELY UPSET our IR student association is hosting an EU conference this friday with like actual ambassadors visiting n shit AND I CANNOT GO bc it's 19+ for wine tasting
???
1933 is a wack year
you did
dear god
nani?
Did I wake up before Alan??
Did I -
SHIT
1933
WHAT YEAR IS IT
are you okay?
https://youtu.be/MDBUFbSbetA
THE FUCK IS THAT CROP
EWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
"where am i"
or should i say
Who are you
good question
Where am I
What time is it really
Wait daylight savings
fun
ah
I hate myself lmao
I have to be up at 8
i was doing bio notes ahhh
lmao same
my face when I came out of the shower and it was 3 am <:PK:610932426147102740>
fuck I totally forgot daylight savings was a thing
I've only been up for 5 hours
My roomate is going to sleep
What do I do
will try
thanks buddy
Stay healthy
ah seattle
But it's the best way to keep off viruses
I know that's like simple stuff
Anyways yeah you seattle guys, just keep drinking lots of water and always always wash your hands
And now she's saving lives
awww cute
I knew her when I was like 6 and she was like 18 or something, we have pictures of back then
ah that's fair
It was kinda like "oh yeah this person has saved lives and helped ensure the safe creation of new life"
hmm shocked you how so
One thing that shocked me was when my cousin told me about helping with delivering babies, and for some reason that just really shocked me
but i do love the field
well some things i would like to see less of
same, but only because my favorite workout is a trail to a nudist beach
Don't act like you're compaining
i have seen too many private bits sigh
this is my stomping ground lmao
welcome to med
well that's horrifying
Ah
than blood?
it has a lower freezing point i think was the main thing
Doesn't alcohol make you lose body heat, so the radiated heat warms the air around you and makes you *feel* warmer?
"emphasis on the rinse"
"rinse and repeat"
he was like "it was 500 cc saline in, pump the 500 cc out"
Yeah me neither
props to u
dude I could not work in the medical field
the nurse who did it actually told me the story
Oh geez
y i k e s
and they had to pump his stomach and everything came out black
but the 1st time he came in, he had a lot of internal bleeding
That's kinda ironic
bc otherwise he would've frozen solid to death
but the only thing that kept him alive was the alcohol in his system
and just wasn't in good shape healthwise
stayed outside
so he's a heavy ass drinker who just
frozen
getting impaled or frozen or both?
What did he do to make him a dumbass haha
Why is he called mr popsicle
but he's alive at least
b/c he a real dumbass
the nurses at evergreen had a repeat patient that everyone knows as mr. popsicle
Oh yeah
kirkland can be p bad tho
ngl
yeah seattle is a hotspot for people doing stupid things
She also says "if you can imagine it, I've seen it"
tell your cousin i said thanks for doing her job
a lot of the bad cases are just flat out depressing
just blood everywhereeeee
Ouchhh
not everything when someone comes in with a bloody taser barb in their face
i'm only there for little snapshots of time and i've seen some crazy shit too
Yeah my cousin tells me she's seen some crazy shit
they deal with some crazy shit on a semi regular basis
i've heard some hecking crazy nurse stories from the nurses and police that work with the evergreen er
it really does
Er nurses are strong people, I imagine it really takes something mentally to work in the er
rip
L
A few people I wanted to actually see in class ☹️
It's sad seeing so many people not attend
And there are tons of people coming in eveyr day for checkup
i love all the ones i work w
honestly props to the er nurses
Because the hospital is in like a constant state of alert
but i could see that
corona itself isnt really an er thing
She told me that nobody with covid 19 has been at her hospital yet but it's been super stressful
how's she doing
ah
My cousin actually works as an emergency room nurse in seattle
I LITERALLY MEANT RAMEN WTF
jkjkjk
Way to ruin a wholesome moment
not even noah gets that
no
you fuck off
Fuck off
buddy
i n s t a n t  n o o d s
"like toothbrushes, instant noodles, whatever"
Aw that’s so sweet
wholesome
my dad was like "if you need anything i can deliver it anytime"
Yeah I just called my parents
There must be a slump in Airbnb bookings so maybe he has less to deal with anyway
My dad was like "I'll take it" haha
I probably should
have not talked to my parents in a week
I
"and then the next day they were like nvm don't come back till 3/21"
Idk of my dad still has to go to work
"they said we were wfh till 3/11"
he was like
yeah same w my dad
My dad's actually working from home rn because microsoft apparently doesn't require anyone to actually come into office anymore
immune system isn't my jam when it comes to anatomy ngl
That’s also true
I always thought drinking water was good because staying hydrated helps your immune system do things and your body work in general
ok hot-tea 😉
You can’t really buy hot tea
hahaha
buy tea now
hot tea kill virus
drink hot tea
It’s from a doctor in China
I feel like that's not legit but idk anything about the science
For the coronavirus, not the cold
Is that how it works? I didn't know that
??
That way if the virus is in your throat the water brings it down to your stomach where it gets killed by acid
One tip is to drink water frequently
Okay, hope you get better soon
which means whatever i have is affecting a diff part of the respiratory system
runny nose times
the chance of it being coronavirus is really low though
I want free weeks of attendance haha
laughs in currently has a cold
like bio class is giving us 2 free weeks of attendance
If you notice any of you guys get something, even if it feels like just a common cold, it'd probably be a good idea to go get it it checked just in case
a lot of UW classes have stopped requiring attendance
so i'm fine but like oofs
i haven't been to volunteering since the news broke
big yike
like 6 of 11 deaths were at the hospital i volunteer at
.... yeah
Be healthy
Stay alert guys
Well this is worrying
Yike
You racist fuck
Rice and beans is at chipotle
No, this is Patrick
the panda express is across the street
sir this is mcdonalds
Rice and beans, can you provide
what would you like?
hello welcome to mcdonalds
they are saying goodbye cruel world
they said "bye" when automatically turning off after a while just now and it scared the fuck out of me holy shit
so my new headphones say "hi" when you turn them on
JESUS christ
entire history of <#532695531898667049> , as of 3/3/2020
backup complete!
starting backup...
!backup
hahahhahahaha
this is what MasteringPhysics gives you when it tells you to "review your trig" and ive never felt so patronzied
Probably just from the adrenaline and I'm probably gonna completely crash in a few hours
pride comes before the fall
rip
I'm also suspiciously energetic rn
This past Tuesday I wasn't even out if bed at this time
Yo I've been awake for 9 hours what the fuck
Wait didn't you say it snowed over there not too long ago??
Imaaaaaagine a world like that 🎵
I m a g i n e
Imagine having snow
It was beautiful earlier but it's snowing super hard now idk if I wanna go back up the mountain
Note to self bring some Tim's or smth next time
I mean yeah but it's still sad
No surprise
Food in whistler is so expensive
Also it is unexpectedly cold rn
Can we delete mornings as a concept
Wow! I hate this so much
(I really wanted to go bungee jumping actually but I cannot bc I don't have a car to get to the bridge rip)
lol
sweet dreams
alright
thank u
gonna just pay for ziplining and go the fuck to bed
OK
ok
ok
my magic eight ball said to go fuck yourself
<@!470822754262712329> ziplining?
ok I should've asked starbot a while ago
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/995/030/65e.jpg
<@!470822754262712329> skiing?
this is the problem
yeah but I love skiing
didn't you already go skiing
I'm freaking out
please make a decision for me
@here
skiing is more expensive but not by a ton
should I say fuck it and ski by myself or should I go ziplining??
someone help I am very indecisive
my friend who I'd normally go skiing with is in europe
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I need to be up at 5 to head back to whistler and I am Very Stressed because I did not plan this trip like at all before tonight
lol
Well as far as jurisdictions go I probably there already 😁
okay glad to hear it
Am almost in issaquah
<@!110137446053736448> did you make it on the bus?
rip buses
shit dude
Losing an hour of sleep is whatever
I'm probably gonna go to math tbh
And come to school ta noon
I can also just not go to math tomorrow
I don't wanna pay
you could just call an uber
Yeah
it's also pretty late
Not many cafes round these parts
All routes take about the same amount of time
oh shit
The 70 bus was like a minute too slow so now I have to stand and wait in pioneer square for an hour ☹️
like I remember when nigahiga first blew up
I feel like I've been on youtube pretty much since the platform began being relevant
honestly it's hard for me to pin down a time frame
8th grade is really when i started using the internet for entertainment
before like 2014 i was not aware enough of internet culture to discern a difference
but I'm not sure if that's right
idk
my instinct is ~2014-15
when did "memes" really inundate internet culture?
lol i made the exact same spelling mistake
nvm
oh
yo did I break him?? lmao
<@!478706068223164416>  you spelled it wrong
gasp
millennial
who are you?
<@!470822754262712329> shut the fuck up
ok boomer
like a post-modern version of a millenial
ok boomer
maybe we count as post-millenials
yeah
idk I've definitely talked about this a lot before bc I find it fascinating but I feel like we really are between two more distinct generations
I feel like the culture split between people our age who are on tik tok and those who aren't is pretty huge and very weird
yeah I've never used tik tok
and i've never downloaded tik tok lmao
oh yeah twitter is something i've forgotten about
and then instagram is still hugely influential bc I feel like it's the most ubiquitous now. also like "influencer culture" etc
most original content / new memes these days is generated from tik tok and twitter
facebook is "for old people" because it's no longer the center of internet culture
tons of kids younger than us don't have actual fb accounts ( well they do but through insta, not through fb the platform)
idk why; it's a new habit
i check facebook posts pretty regularly
I don't read posts on facebook anymore it's like a lot of effort to check it. I literally only use it for events
yeah but starting w us and maybe people a year or two older facebook use drops off a lot I think
i think that's true across all social media platforms
ahh i see
I'm not sure how to describe it properly but they have much less of a shitpost culture
how do they use insta differently?
Real Millennials, even those on the younger side like my sister, are much more on facebook. also usually on instagram but like the way they use insta is markedly different
i just know class of 2024 is crazy about Tik Tok
I find that people our age are in a weird in-between hellspace as far as culture and social media go
(rhetorical question)
isn't facebook for old people? then how can i still spend so much time on it?
banning trolls
People breaking into cars
any recent drama?
ah the infamous sammamish say anything
Bruh moment
but the most impressive part is how understandable it is for a layperson
I love this video for a number of reasons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPX7NJe1Mog
because of this video I passed onto my dad, which he passed onto some higher ups
also if they make a video on the topic, I'm gonna take credit for that idea
they'll be fine
but just remember in the last ten years they've x6 their stock
oh rip
but it's gonna be a bit till they get back to where they were
long term
they'll be fine though
the "waitlist" is years
and they sell more than they can make "quickly"
they don't make an airplane if they don't have it already sold
cause the bottleneck is always production
which is basically unheard of in airplane production
and they shut down production
they make 42 a month
plus 400 more were made and just sitting
and 400 are grounded
the 737 was their biggest money maker
awwwww
look at the pupper
i like the shark version a lot
speaking of boeing I vaguely heard that they have not been doing well recently
sadly
this was Boeing's version of the F35, which lost
people made fan art
aww why is that actually cute
C O N S U M E
hey at least he's happy
also very meme
very aero
pretty and aero don't always go together
..huh
within the regulations at the time
because it was the best aerodynamically
uh
as you can see, they're all having stage fright
Ok but actually why the dildo in front
Lol
Well yeah but that's my gripe w a lot of matte things in general they seem to pick up a lot more dirt
see f1 2014 penis cars
looking good isn't exactly a priority
it is a racecar
to be fair the racecar is likely kinda dirty
uh ~
^
That's more than my house
Oof
1.3 m?
basically all carbon fiber has to be laid by hand
How much does it cost though
Yeah the glossy car looks super dusty lol
now that is craftmanship
Damn that's satisfying
see how the weave forms a perfect "V" in the middle
I wonder if the lighting is part of the problem on the first
bare carbon is basically the biggest flex, cause it means the carbon has to be laid basically perfect
Matte looks better but also dirty
They both look pretty bad honestly
it's an lmp3 car
ignore the crazy car
matte
Oh yikes
glossy
matte bare carbon is possibly better than glossy bare carbon
but
and especially bare carbon fiber cars
Ok I was about to say are you one of those people who like matte cars
car paint
cars
there is 1/2 exceptions
I in general hate glossy
Even though it'd reduce glare
no reflection
Sometimes I really like how matte things feel but I do not like the idea of a matte phone screen
love it
it's great
but yea
I think I just showed Salina and Jarrett in person
understand now
ah
*either you did not mention that you got a matte protector to this group or i missed it,and the idea of having a matte screen seems kinda cursed to me
`You did not say that and that sounds kinda cursed??`
I have no clue what that means
Wow I... Hate that
what?
apple charges $1000 on the new xdr for display for the matte option
You did not say that and that sounds kinda cursed??
all my displays from now on will be matte
it's great
but I got a matte screen protector for my phone
I may have said this
I got a new case and an actual s screen protector a while back
No thankfully
gonna need screen number 3?
nice
This was very embarrassing
I just got sushi and was walking back to my room while balancing my phone on the box while listening to a podcast while texting you guys and then just fuckin. Dropped everything
sadly that does not help projects
that's what you need babe
a life
._.
what more could I need other than Salina and Herc
plus the tower market is there too
why, I have a elevator then skybridge to the gym
go outside
you guys are depressing
I am the same, except only the second part
i really alternate between coming back to my room at 1 am and never leaving my room the entire weekend
cause i didnt have lunch
i ate two scones and an ice cream bar an hour ago
i'm currently eating "lunch"
im always here for you Noah
this makes me feel better
and my roommate has informed me that he is going to dinner
i have just gotten out of bed
this is why depression naps are a thing
I mean
I really need to do laundry
I’m down to my last face towel
your fusiform face area is giving up
does that mean
L
I think I’m developing *prosopagnosia*
Is it bad that I can’t remember my lab partners face even though I’ve seen him three times
*for weather reasons
it takes like over a foot of snow for anything to be cancelled here
which is a rip but yeah
no my prof has the flu
lol for snow?
I got super lucky though my first class got cancelled today
-been awake for an hour
-need a nap
nobody does
I don't wanna be back
welcome back to society
predictably, I overslept today
I just got carried away working on personal stuff
L
bad
cindy nooooo
what happened lol
I really need to fix my sleep schedule
L
my flight got cancelled time to find something else to do
depressed
I'm
jarrett usually we call that hibernation
*16*
thats 16 hours of sleep
only way to explain it
sorry bud
you're so bad at life
like what
and then i woke up at 5 pm
lmao
5... pm?
no no 4 am
went back to sleep at 5
4... pm?
woke up at 4 and brushed my teeth and stuff
so how is sleep bullshit
uh huh
i went to sleep at 12 midnight last night
wtf
no
jarrett
just wake up
did you
I went to sleep at 12
Sleeping is bullshit
take an *a e s t h e t i c* photo for me~~
I should too
good night and have fun tomorrow
night!
with that in mind I wanna sleep now
yeah fr
let's enjoy what we have left while we can
earth's fucked
let's goooo
gen z baby
another favorite line is "I hope hopeless changes over time" from halsey's hopeless
I have way too many favorite songs
yeah seems about right
so there's nothing to do but get lost in the present
the future is far off and unknown to me
lots of happy things happening
lots of sad things happening
I feel like this song just represents best where my life is
*Let me swim in this dream, even if this is a lie 
I'll be searching for the correct, correct present 
We're believing in a future we can't see 
So searching for the correct, correct present, we shine*
*Sad, sad, sad, sad 
Happy, happy, happy, happy 
Shaken by the two emotions, 
I just illuminate the destination I can't see yet*
https://www.animelyrics.com/anime/koitouso/kanashiiureshii.htm
(translated: sad, happy)
frederic - kanashii ureshii
lemme share one more
well okay
likewise for the ones you chose lmao
I almost feel bad for making such an obvious point
these lyrics really suit your personality
*If it brings me to my knees, it's a bad religion, ooh
This unrequited love
To me, it's nothin' but a one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I can never make him love me*
last one I'll mention is bad religion - frank ocean. it's pretty short but EVERY LINE in that song is incredible and it's still my favorite out of an incredible discography
*Slow down, you crazy child
You're so ambitious for a juvenile
But then if you're so smart, tell me
Why are you still so afraid, hmm?

Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?
You'd better cool it off before you burn it out
You've got so much to do and only so many hours in a day-ay*
for content and message in general I also really love vienna - billy joel, it feels like a callout post but as a classic and gorgeous song lol
for like less specific imagery but that paint a really vivid picture of the situation... passenger side - smallpools, which is about reminiscing on a wild past love, chorus is about steering from the passenger side while the girl takes her shirt off and changes the music under vegas lights. and also imagine - ariana grande, which hits hard bc it's about mac miller, and when she sings "why can't you imagine a world like that?" it's bc he's dead
gen z vibe check
bleak nihilism
apparently I'm a big fan of songs about bleak and nihilistic partying lol bc another fave is from the morning - the weeknd, when he describes his group as "zombies of the night" on a club crawl
*might get your friend to drive but he can hardly see /
we'll end up painted on the road
red and chrome /
all the broken glass sparkling /
I guess we're partying*
probably my favorite imagery ever is from lorde's homemade dynamite though
I have a lot of favorite songs for a lot of different reasons
I mean honestly? iconic, good for you
sing it well? probably not. but hey at least I'm prepared if I'm ever challenged to go to Japanese karaoke
and I would be lying if I didn't say that I've actually learned how to sing the song as pronunciation practice
the song plays on that beautifully
the word "itte" can either mean "to say" or "to pass away"
but basically it's a story of how a girl sings for someone who is gone
https://www.animelyrics.com/jpop/yorushika/itte.htm
the lyrics themselves don't make much sense individually
but funnily enough Hitchcock isn't my favorite song by Yorushika, it's actually Itte (Say it)
rip!
it's amazing how I love to bathe in pessimism
*What was your dream, Sensei?
Did you forget it when you became an adult?"*
*A story where people die dramatically will sell, won't it?
I've come to hate that even the moment that a flower's petals fall has a price on it.*
*Why is it that the character for "happiness" includes the ￥ sign?
Is it on purpose that leaving out a single stroke turns it into the character for "pain"?*
*Is it selfish to just want to look at the blue sky?*
oh right!
a few lines
translations translations
uhhh
you already knew this but it's Hitchcock by Yorushika
what are your favorite songs by lyrics / content / message / theme
*and somehow she loses every single time*
*like, how can you even be bad at candyland?*
*don't even get me started on how bad she is at candyland*
I can do this for the rest of the lyrics I've been shitposting
isn't it ironic how the world is so rough around the edges despite being round?
I'll rewrite it in my own voice
they're song lyrics
probably is
if you want my honest response that sounds like a fakedeep tumblr quote
even though it's round?
sharp around the edges
that the world is left to us
don't you find it ironic
(￣ー￣)
***S***
I mean I'd say no
depends who you ask
is high a prerequisite to vibe
ok that makes you sound like you're high

*v i b i n*
how you doin
it don't mean a lot I just wanna talk
said you liked it when we talked, made the time stop
It wasn't on purpose and idk if she even noticed bc I feel like she would tell me
It's fine I'm over it and she's one of my fave people
r i p
this is why we can't have nice things
*hulk smash*
I didn't see what happened and didn't notice till ~3 hours later but one of my fave shades in one of my fave palettes kinda exploded
I go into the bathroom to change
she was looking through my collection and I told her she could swatch them if she wanted
how did that happen?
that's a rather odd chain of events
?
Completely different note I'm lowkey salty bc one of my friends came into my room and broke an eyeshadow SMH
And dinner
I think I’m gonna skip comp sci recitation today
L
Generally not a good time
And I have a food coma
Fuck it’s so hot in this classroom
oh god
👀
we should have a hoedown
Forgot those existed
*hoedown*
noah trying to twirl salina at a pine lake hoedown
TERRIBLE THOUGHT OF THE NIGHT
Though, other people who show up are usually alumni or students from other schools in the area
You'd be surprised
if it's already on campus, wouldn't it only be students anyway then?
why though
`student-only`?
those are wed nights
but
lol we actually have student-only wed night parties @ the pit aka the main club/bar on campus
sorry sorry i'll see myself out
get ready for wild wild wednesday
you heard of wild wild west
rip
People are being really fucking loud in my building at 1:30 on a Tuesday night for no reason
rip
I might be pretty sad if I end up at home for the second half of the summer lol
thanks
oh good luck
depends
also always on the lookout for campaign work
is it more like an internship or a legit job
I applied for some congressional aide positions but mostly media stuff
what sort of job are you looking for?
we'll see if I actually land a job
I'm really tryna spend this summer on the east coast
lol
and get married for tax benefits bc we'll fucking need it
hey maybe we could both end up in NYC
I'm probably gonna end up in dc, nyc, or international
oh you're saying you're moving away from mountains and trees
no
<@!503787499605458954> you're probably staying on west coast too? where?
> But I probably wanna stay west coast with mountains and trees
<@!478706068223164416> this is the big sad part of my future lol but I've come to terms w it
rip
i don't have enough motivation to move to an entirely different culture
beautiful country, but I don't think I would fit in well with social norms
yeah definitely
japan
in japan or london?
is very intense
work culture
`great to visit but terrible to live in`
how do the Japanese feel then?
i've heard a lot of good things about London's culture
But I probably wanna stay west coast with mountains and trees
Kyoto maaaaaybe
it's very crowded
😦
great to visit but terrible to live in
oh
no not really
wait actually??
JAPAN
i'd like to live somewhere where I don't have to move out of when I want to switch jobs
but most of the "best" tech companies are HQ'ed in the US
i eventually should consider it more
it's not an idea i've given much thought to
<@!472541429130854421>
why?
I mean that's very possible
not unless i'm still working for a US tech company
no
would you ever consider living abroad?
the only problem is fewer companies are there
NYC is also expensive to live in but I feel like i'll get a lot out of living there
cali seems to be kind of a mess right now so the only other place i'll consider is probably NYC
interesting
i could go anywhere, but i think the exact amount on the paycheck is pretty important to me. I don't think I would choose to go live somewhere else for a different job if a large company paid me more
I don't think you need to worry too much about rent costs
I mean it might be the easiest and financially smartest but it doesn't have to be your choice, or where you ultimately end up
and it's not like I know seattle that well so i can still get something out of living closer to the city
i could live in my parents' house until i earn enough to buy my own, saving rent costs
for me it just feels like Seattle area is the easiest and the financially smartest move for me
figures
Germany
actually question for everyone bc I'm curious do you know where you wanna live in the future
cause noah's right you could go almost anywhere w a CS degree
do you have strong feelings about where you want to live?
but most likely i'm gonna go for the returning offer of whatever internship i do in my junior year
i guess in the end i'll also apply to some stuff in NYC to see what happens
or F 35 "problems"
see 737 Max problems
software is huge for them
plus all aerospace companies
as do most traditional automakers
Formula 1 employs a "large" number of software engineers
but if you worry about ca cost then you don't care for it either
all things considered
but companies all over the world hire software engineers
i mean ny is pretty decent for tech too
I mean if you want to have a very "traditional" tech job yea
but i also hate the cost of living in california and am not a huge fan of the weather so i have no reason to move there, leaving just seattle
since i'm doing CS it's ideal to be in either silicon valley or seattle, so there are a lot of other tech people and it's easy to switch to new jobs
?
it's also kind of sad knowing i don't have a lot of choice in where to move
i've been sitting here for a long long time
welcome aboard the ship
ah
then realizing i have 3 more years makes me sad
when i think about the future I want to be there already
or why this is in sad boi hours
is there a reason why you find that sad
i've only been in college for less than a year and i'm already thinking about what i'm gonna do after college
*Don't stop me now
'Cause I'm having a good time*
oh lol
I said something like “stop I hate this” in response to Noah
what'd she say?
It sent very late
lmfao I was VERY confused for a moment there helen
...thanks
good luck with walking for the next 12 hours
...
I think I see the issue here
and then I went skiing yesterday
it was actually sunny and gorgeous here on saturday so I did a training hike w the big bag
what've you been up to lol
??
get help
stop
-_-
for some reason my calves are the worst
oh my GOD  I'm dying
you're welcome
wow ok lmao
on "a chair"
"sitting"
hoooooly shit I just stood up after sitting for like 2 hours... my entire lower body is so sore idk how I'm gonna function tomorrow
I'm simultaneously shook that it's already been a month and already fucking exhausted
a snowstorm skipping seattle
a lot of dragging feet on impeachment
I'll start: a Boeing 737 carrying civilians was shot down by anti aircraft missiles
What the everloving FUCK happened in January?
Let me prompt the question
January is over as of today
well, be kind to yourself
alright
Thanks again idk how I'm gonna make it through the next few days
Ok fair enough you're right as usual
sorry to be blunt
1) you fuck yourself over
2) your friend feels responsible for you getting fucked over
but i get the sense that destabilizing yourself to help them is a net negative
and i wish them the best
i feel for your friend, i really do
but i get the feeling that you might be overburdening yourself on this
let me be clear; I'm not saying to just walk away
Logically I know that's true, practically I don't think I'd ever forgive myself if I said "no I can't help you" to a friend who's one of the sweetest people ever after one of the most traumatic possible life experiences. Logically I also know this is not sustainable at all and I'm already feeling the physical affects on my health lol. So idk. Gotta find a balance somehow I guess
take care of yourself
i know that helping someone all the way feels like the absolute right thing to do, but sometimes the best we can do is giving them the right resources and take a step back
there is no shame in taking time for yourself and letting others know that you aren't in a place to help them in that moment
i also just want to say another thing
no problem
lol that's really overselling it
Thank you, you're a godsend
i hope you feel better soon
Alright
but it can be as simple as "things really aren't going well, i'm trying my best with what i've got" or just "hey i'm having trouble with life stuff"
you don't have to spill the details
it can't hurt to at least talk to your teachers
As far as what you said earlier about what you can do, it's not nothing, being able to talk about it is so cathartic you have no idea thanks for listening
you really worried matheny and other teachers
please take care of yourself
please don't let this be a repeat of last year
I went to counseling yesterday and am going again on Friday, I've spoken to no one else and I don't think I've acted any different but I feel like absolute shit and I think some profs are kinda worried but I have no idea what to say to them
give yourself some room to breathe
I'm not sure if it's just the physical exhaustion speaking but school and life have kind of been put on hold for now and I feel like this whole situation has proved that my own mental health was more fragile than I thought I guess
to yourself or to your friend or just anyone around you
it's not productive in any way
dont be hard on yourself about this
well
It almost makes me feel worse about how I've been coping w everything, which has been: not at all lmao
it really is amazing they've pulled it together, but it's also really not sustainable
Yeah for sure
i can only imagine that there are measures in place that would make it easier on them
rape is far more drastic
lina got leeway for getting harrassed by a guy
most if not all colleges have protocols for this kind of thing
it really isnt
that's not good
Again I'm kind of amazed at how well they've been handling everything tbh. They say they just feel kind of empty though. Which is probably really not good. I wish they'd take a break, they just threw themselves back into classes
I mean yeah they've been talking to a few people and kinda working themselves up to reporting the guy and going to therapy or something
i've seen a couple at evergreen
a lot of victims go on lockdown
i'm assuming they aren't comfortable reaching out for certain resources rn
is there anyone else they could reach out to
I've felt like absolute garbage for the past 2 days and kinda feel like everything's falling apart
i would ask if there was anything we could do to help but i strongly suspect the answer is no
that's fair
And I feel like I need to keep being strong for them but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't really heavily affecting my own health
Idk they were telling me like. They said no, and they tried to resist, but afterwards they were still trying to rationalize it, pretend/convince themselves they wanted it etc. Honestly I think they've been incredibly strong handling the whole thing
They know who it was I do not
I know
right after would have been best but it's rare that anyone is in any state to after that
Do they know who the dude was?
I don't think so yet
good
Going to
did she report it
I was like mildly tipsy and not at all prepared to deal w that but I tried my best I guess. I'm still trying my best. So yeah I barely slept, and then I had to get up and pretend everything was normal and get dim sum w my parents, and then Sunday night we got together and they told me everything. Like all the awful fucking details. And I couldn't sleep after that either, I can't even imagine what it's been like for them going back to the room it happened every night since, I offered for them to stay over but they were like no I just need to get over it
ah shit
I had a really great Saturday, my parents came up to visit, it was new years, I went out that night. An hour after I got back to my room, around 2-3 am? One of my best friends here called me crying and told me they were raped
start where it feels natural
ah
Honestly, not really, and I'm not even sure where to start w this
you okay?
go ahead
Ok I'm currently miserable on the bathroom floor and I really don't wanna add to all the other shit all of y'all are dealing with but can I talk to you guys about something really heavy
But I barely slept Saturday/Sunday and then completely crashed for ~15-16 hours yesterday night
No
Are you sick?
oof
I feel kinda like I'm gonna puke
I can't sleep, nothing helps
I have a really shitty headache that's gotten progressively worse for the past 4 hours or so
que paso chica
uh
Wow I feel literally awful
People tend to be secretive about procedures so I’d probably have to do a person-by-person physical examination
However I’d have to cross a lot of social norms to find out who
To be fair there’s probably a larger proportion on campus
First I’d have to find a girl with fake boobs
Meaning that long ago there was one singular OG small boob lover
Which means that its a mutation
<@!472541429130854421> say it's for science
Guys who like small breasts are a genetic defect?
So
I’m not gonna grope some girls fake boobs to verify that
*reportedly*
Some types of implants can reportedly feel very realistic
At least, small breast genetics will continue to proliferate no matter what is considered most attractive because girls can get boob jobs now
No I’m sure they’ll continue to exist
if it all works as "intended" they eventually won't
They’re not meant to exist
and inconsistent
humans are dumb
How do dudes that like small breasts fit into this?
So
"not only are you ugly on the outside, but you're also ugly on the inside"
basically in this case you can judge a book by it's cover
woah
basically your body makes you "fight" hard to look good, so if you look good that means your body was good at "fighting", therefore you have good genes
although he does just link to it as well
this is a guy on reddit breaking down the study in a much more manageable way
https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5etldw/eli5why_do_boobs_vary_so_much_in_size_many_being/dafb4ox/
but also, respect
a cursed sentence if I've ever seen one
that's
omg
let me grab the study I saved from like 3 years ago on boobs
kinda
and what counts as looking "more masculine"?
yes
is the reverse true for girls?
huh interesting
in psych, on the day we learned about sexual attractiveness, prof said that apparently men who look more masculine are more attractive because they have to have a lot of testosterone to look masculine, and having high amounts of testosterone degrades immune system, so if a guy can handle a lot of testosterone then he also has a great immune system
didn't know that
Estrogen and testosterone both influence immune system
but even that is hard to judge
because every time they rolled around stuff would happen
we're pretty sure my arthritis is linked to my stress, seeing as when I get stressed I would often have flare ups, but what helped us tell is finals
Being on a period messes with your immune system a bit
I mean afaik your immune system isn't weaker when you're on your period so it's prob just chance
I know
I think she's just saying it's hard to tell
but is that because of you period or is because of chance
Yeah, all three times I got sick this year it started while I was on my period
3/4 of the time it's consistent, and then 1/4 of the time were gonna start playing bingo with the body
as someone that spent ~10 years chasing around medical problem, periods seem like literally the worst thing ever for trying to asses the effectives of a treatment
Could be because I’m on my period
I lay down on my bed at 5 but got up bc if I didn’t I would fall asleep
Today I’m feeling pretty tired even though I’ve gotten good sleep for the past week.
idk man sometimes I wonder if I have like chronic fatigue syndrome or like a legit medical condition
it's not really?? I barely slept on sunday but that was like an isolated case. otherwise I've been sleeping a p consistent 7-8 hours
yo sleep sched is fucked
bc
I slept from ~5 pm yesterday to ~9 pm, drifted in and out of sleep from 9-12, and then slept from 1 am to almost 1 pm why am I STILL tired
rip
I give up trying to sleep
rip
Sad
Why the FUCK has there been loud ass construction happening outside since 5:30 am??????
enjoy your frosty canadian coronavirus free air
until then, gl
yeah kind of
kinda feel like it's only a matter of time before it spreads here
yupyup
good to know thank you
switch that shit often
so if you use masks
nice
which honestly ramps up your risk anyway
attracts microorgs and gets them to cling to the mask
but uh moisture
sigh
ah
umu
can you please not
no fuck you
fuck you starbot we're having a serious convo
wait
*moist*
can you please not
the other thing is that moisture accumulates on the inside of masks
that's fair
I read that masks prob aren't effective bc the particles are prob small enough to still be breathed in through them
if it is droplet transmission
the masks are helpful, but they're kind of shite against droplet ngl
`human coronaviruses are most commonly spread between an infected person and others via: 

—the air (from viral particles from a cough or sneeze); 

—close personal contact (touching or shaking hands); 

—an object or surface with viral particles on it (then touching your mouth, nose or eyes before washing your hands);

 —and rarely from fecal contamination.`
and contact is "oops i touched it"
droplet is more like "shite i was in the vicinity when it happened"
but what airborne means is that they can (idk how else to describe it) persist in the air and travels longer distances
but it's unlikely to be airborne bc most of the cases have been physically linked to wuhan
it could be droplet/contact
okay actually revisited some details
but it's the "i touched this sick bitch and then i maybe like ate food or did my makeup and introduced this shit into my body"
because it's not the handshaking that will make you sick
idk how to respond to that
errrr
so if you shake hands you'll get it but not if they cough on you?
hand hygiene, folks
wash your hands
yeah
so yeah, prob not masks
it looks like it's contact, not airborne/droplet from the info released to media
which is weird bc there's been a lot of cases in china
I read masks probably don't actually help
we haven't figured out which transmission precautions we need for it
lol
there were two cases in seattle and my dad said his office is handing out surgical masks to everyone
ah that's fair
especially in richmond
more w like real adults who travel back and forth a lot
the frenzy doesn't have much to do w international students here
though not as much as vancouver
we have tons of chinese internationals
chinese people are the biggest minority group in van
doesn't surprise me in either case
lol no one here is worried at all
I was literally just reading about it, and we discussed it in history this morning
it's causing quite a lot of panic here even though there are no confirmed cases yet
L
damn those international students 😡
let's go with that
sure
heh
really? I was kinda like if that's the worst of your subconscious then you're an incredibly pure person
well that's grim
Starbot is the worst parts of my subconscious brought to light
So starbot is your left brain?
and now so will I
you shut the fuck up
I like how you actually shut the fuck up per starbot's request
educational, thank you
you shut the fuck up
lefty is the one telling righty to shut the fuck up a lot of the time
DESTROY THEIR SOULS
GO GET EM
lemme smash
righty is the one taking over when I say stuff like
but the emotion and feeling I'm writing with is the work of righty
so when you read what I'm typing it's mostly the work of lefty
analytical requires the help of both sides too
both sides are required for creativity
right brain: responsible for spatial awareness, facial recognition, understanding emotional language, and abstract thinking
has control over speech and writing
left brain: responsible for logical thought and language processing
ahem
lemme get my toast and I'll look at my notes
but it's not wrong, just an oversimplification
in terms of the analytical/creative thing yes
in terms of the analytical vs creative thing
maybe I'm the fool but hasn't the left/right brain thing been disproven
right brain doesn't have that analytical power so it just defaults to "I wanna eat"
left brain works more analytically so it knows not enough time has passed
psych teachings refer to the conscience as just the general awareness of the mind
is that not just your regular thoughts
ok a) that's not really a conscience b) that's not how left/right brain works
left brain says of course not you impatient bastard
right brain says yes
right now we're arguing over whether or not enough time has passed for my toast to be toasted in the lounge so I can go get it
I've said this before
my conscience sounds like a conversation
also how my brain works
big think
can't empty your head if your head is empty already
with sleep I tend to just exhaust myself until I feel like I can't keep my eyes open anymore
you know
also alan I'm the opposite I've always been quite good at emptying my head completely and just paying attention to my surroundings
woo
i am my voice of reason
no
do y'all actually have little voices in your head telling you about morality
what does your conscience sound like
if there was a way for you to listen in on my conscience for an hour you'd probably get very annoyed with all the random tangents I happen on
so much so in fact that I'm actually more relaxed when I let my thoughts run freely even though it technically stops me from sleeping
it takes so much mental willpower on my end
stop thinking
just
but ironically one of the hardest things for me to do in bed (tee hee) is to stop thinking
I'm better about it now
thought so
tbh don't think I've ever done that
yeah kinda
I think it sounds like a very Alan thing
is worrying about how much I sleep causing me to not sleep well a very Alan thing
I think I've only had like 1 or 2 dreams about going to class so far this year and I can't remember anything specific from them so I think I've escaped that phase of my life
my school dreams were always like hyper realistic
other times I'd just dream that I had a pretty regular but generally Bad day
where I'd dream that I'd get up and get dressed and go through my whole ass morning routine and walk to the bus stop and shit AND THEN I'D WAKE UP hella disoriented
also this is a lot less bad now but I used to have "going to school" stress dreams
omg I experience the dreaming that you didn't sleep thing all the time
this psych reading is really out here reminding me how undeniably single I am
that's fucked up
**Pseudo Insomnia: Dreaming that you didn't sleep**
I feel attacked
> Ironically, a major cause of insomnia is worrying about sleep. When you experience this kind of insomnia, you may be tired enough to sleep. As you try to fall asleep, however, you worry about whether you will get to sleep and may even panic about how a lack of sleep will affect you. This anxiety leads to increased arousal, which interferes with normal sleep patterns. It’s a vicious cycle.
I feel like someone needs to see this
I sure hope so
is it possible to learn this power
> People tend to sleep less as they age. However, researchers were skeptical when a 70-year-old retired nurse, Miss M., reported sleeping only about an hour a night—that is, until she agreed to participate in a study. On her first two nights in a research laboratory, Miss M. was unable to sleep, apparently because of the excitement. But on her page101third night, she slept for only 99 minutes, then awoke refreshed, cheerful, and full of energy (Meddis, 1977).
You know me so well
"She's not responding, I bet she just realized she has something to do right now"
I was thinking you forgot something
HAH
have fun

Like came within 10 mins of missing the taxi bc I wasn't getting my friends texts for some reason
Ok completely different note and reason I dipped from the convo w Alan (sorry I'll read and get back to you later) I ALMOST FORGOT IM SUPPOSED TO GO TO A CONCERT TN
rip
THERE'S SOMETHING BEEPING EVERY MINUTE OR SO EITHER IN ONE OF THE ROOMS ADJACENT TO ME AND IT'S DRIVING ME NUTS
night b happy bday again!!
BYE
I'm dead I'm going to sleep
good work
I hate it because I'm sassing myself
mmmmmmmm

Joseph can get other things besides dio as well
they're trying to find dio
he has two abilities, vines and spirit photography
if they always have dio in them
what do spirit pictures accomplish
like i both get it and don't at the same time???
i just don't get hermit purple
it gets stranger the longer it goes on
and that one? oh that one can casually be a brain surgeon
this one likes photography
so this one shoot fire
but the stands are like
kinda awk that a very smol kid is running around w it tho
the death stand was p interesting tho
fun fun
Star Platinum is canonically one of the strongest stands in the universe
no that's a fair judgement
everyone else's is like "huh"
star platinum is like quite op ngl
where they introduced the stands
i've only seen like part of season 3
it goes from no to yes to maybe in a a matter of a few episodes sometimes
ゴゴゴゴゴ
JoJo is either gay or not gay depending on how much of the series you've watched
energy for anything comes in erratic bursts
that can be said of my interest in the vast majority of things in life lmao
actually
yep
^
either I have 0 interest at all or I get super into something really quick and get sucked in completely for a week or two
tv is dangerous for me
tbf I also binged all of season 2 of tgp in like 2 days
exactamente
I knew it was coming
... crowning achievement
you could say that was her
except that one time my mom binged the crown
i watched some episodes w noah during break
actually my sister is p much the only person who does use it
ゴゴゴゴゴ
jojo is... interesting
my family has netflix, I just basically never use it
hm
man why did I ever let you do these things
ora ora ora
muda muda muda
yes starbot we get it
ゴゴゴゴゴ
so that and JoJo's are my recommendations for Netflix account holders
funny enough it streams on Netflix of all places
story is a nice bonus
I'd recommend it on art alone
the community describes it as "ruining every other anime" levels of good
too late, but yes that is very pretty
just don't read the subs if you really care about not being spoiled on anything
okay wait no it's minor spoilers but let's be honest it's pretty fucking obvious
(the scene makes zero sense out of context so no worries about spoilers)
this is ridiculous
just look at this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaokHCLggB4
wow ok opinion noted
it is hands down THE MOST BEAUTIFULLY ANIMATED THING ON THE PLANET
but other than that
I describe the feeling as catharsis on crack
but in whole it tells a very sincere and somber story
it can be a little whiplashy if not prepared for
then returns to its plot-like form at the very end
then it splits up into some individual stories
the anime itself is structed at first as a chronological progression of events
o_O
through her various journeys she learns more about love and emotion
she goes on a jouney to become an automemory doll, whose job is to ghostwrite letters for people
who lost both of her arms in the war
Violet Evergarden is a battle-scarred child soldier
as short as possible
uhhhh
what's it about
some people don't get it and others get super into it
that is, if you get into it
VE might just be it
ok as far as I can remember I have never cried or come even close to crying at anything animated
that shit hurts
man fuck episode 10
especially episode 10
violet evergarden by kyoto animation pushed me to almost crying several times
lmao
sometimes I don't watch the last episode of a cute girls anime because I don't want it to end
I feel like I should rewatch endgame at some point but:
-my marvel obsession has died down a bit (just a bit though)
-it's a really long time commitment lol
-I remember p much all of it bc it's been memed to death
-personally prefer IW by like a lot
-yknow, didn't actually like how it ended That Much, so I feel like I might be saltier and enjoy it less outside of a magical hype-filled theater experience
when I actually buckle up to watch movies I know will be depressing I tend to be kinda emotionless i.e. stuff like schindler's list
and life is beautiful, and cmbyn, and funny enough the hobbit - battle of five armies when thorin dies
rogue one got me to tear up at the end
a decade of emotional connection!!!!!
YEAH I MEAN
(of course it was endgame)
I actually still haven't rewatched it ever
I have been in full-out tears exactly once and that was endgame
ok I actually really don't cry easily at movies
shit hits right here
if I wanna cry I'll rewatch the MV of porter robinson's Shelter
and then I needed a pick-me-up so I started on the extended return of the king lol
priorities
ah
for some reason I decided I wanted to cry tn so I put on call me by your name, which is one of my all time faves, and then the farewell

I'm such a good friend
I'll start
no cheating
whatever
is 11 PM sad boy hours
Except I’m currently kind of sick so I almost always take a nap later
So far I’ve been enjoying it actually
My roommate and I made a pact to go to sleep at 10 and wake up at 6 on school nights
driving into seattle at 5:00 in the morning was quiet at least
staying up till 4 and getting up at 4 are very different experiences
hate that
I
twas fun
i woke up at 4 for nursing clinicals during the summer
6:30 is a stretch though
I could see myself getting into an earlier routine significantly post-college
well ok
no I'm kidding lmao I actually respect that I just could Never do that on a regular basis
~~coffee drinkers should be killed off~~
i see how it is
ow
~~morning people don't deserve rights~~
i should really sleep earlier
it's going okay at best
good luck
yikes man
my goal is to be able to wake up at 6:30 by the end of the quater
signed, waking up at 7:30 now to go to the gym
I hold the strong belief that nobody wants to be a morning person
4 am is morning
morning people are a myth
*morning person*
slowly becoming a morning person has meant that i've become increasingly anal about getting woken up early lol
lmao
ok but alan we were all awake at that point
i need my sleep gdi
you can pry my cold dead body out of bed at 4 am
4 AM isn't too much farther
I mean we did it at 2 AM
ah
more like trying to drag me out of bed to frolic outside at 4 am
cue the college students running around licking the snow on the ground
for half my friends who came from tropical places though this is the first time they've ever seen snow and it's been really cute to see their reactions lol
it's so fucking cold rn I literally don't wanna leave my bed again for the next week
i vote shower
right now
currently debating showering and going to bed
Update: the fly lost energy and fell to the floor so I killed it
Yeah I totally do that lol
....
Collect their bodies a few days later
Sometimes I trap bugs between my window and the netting and just let them die
N
Y
Is this animal cruelty?
There’s a fly in my room for several days that I’ve just been letting starve to death
that's actually so sad
omg
kinda miss when he was a sweet lil cuddle boi, but he seems to be trying his best
and he has a doofy lil cross eyed action going on in the expression department
he's v jumpy and nervous all the time now
my friend's cat is now deaf because he got attacked and almost died
G'night
lol thanks, I was just startled though. night b
Alright. Call me if you need anything, cuz it might take a bit for me to fall asleep. Take care and stay safe, Cindy.

Me: Wow, PS4 deals look hella tempting right about now. I should consider this.
Also me: *Doesn't have a TV, doesn't have space for another console, is aware Black Friday deals were better, knows that the PS5 is coming out in less than a year, has a huge backlog of games on other platforms*
`2 degree weather` love a celsius king, keep appealing to my canadianness
but temp variations are like 20-30 degrees across a day, while it's max 10 degrees at home, so we have much higher highs
low temps here are actually pretty similar to home
Anyways, here's 2 degree weather
That's okay, it's good to have you back
Been a while since you last visited?
Welcome to morning
, I hate myself 8:30 feels unbearably early
Ah yes, the vultures circling waiting for everyone to sleep
As long as you make sure you aren't staying up *to* jerk it, it's a great method to get yourself to sleep
And also the rush of dopamine really gets you to a high which comes crashing down to the lowest of lows
For one its a physical activity which tires you out at least a bit
Yes
But as for the whole beating your meat deal
Well seeing as I just woke up from sleeping after showing I really gotta agree with Noah on this one
To help explain the great sacrifices that are necessary sometimes when you beat your meat
Man I really wish Jarrett was up right now
You miss the point, it's not about being in the mood, it's about doing what needs to be done for the greater good
Not in the mood, already showered earlier, no drugs on hand, guess I'll just suffer
Thay works very well too
Or chugg Nyquil
Masturbate then shower is the match made in heaven for not being able to sleep
If Jarrett was up he could back me up on this
Ah
Like I've had this issue before
I'm just tryna sleep man and it's not working bc I keep feeling my own pulse and it's really fucking weird
Was hanging out with a friend after finals when he was tripping on acid, and that is in the same vein as some of the stuff he was saying
But saying that makes you sound high as fuck
Nope
Do y'all ever get freaked out by the sound/feel of your own heartbeat
I feel like it wasn't that long ago but idk anymore
I forgot when I put laundry into the dryer
Hahaha
~~alan, alone at uw on a fri night: oh yeah, I want to get FUCKED~~
Jkjkjk
Mostly dick
And dick
He wants attention
r u ok

So... Yeah lol
My exam is at 7 pm
you stayed up late the night before your exam???
guess it's helpful bc I have another exam tomorrow and really need to cram
idk I'm like weirdly energetic still
I was the first person outside and the first person back up the stairs today
canadians are really nice I guess
you know I'm not really sure
or at least had an angry mob sent after them
how have these people not been evicted or something
bruh
I was awake though so it wasn't actually that bad
Fire alarm off again
It's actually been a while
Ugh
Damn lmaooo

last time I went sledding I got run over by a French guy
you gonna say that's when you just don't show up?
what
no
that's when you wait for it to snow and then just bring a sled
you see
ah, looks like exactly zero fun
It's one of my favorite local training trails but it's fuckin brutal
Btw, I really wasn't exaggerating w the stairs
if your legs don't work you can't run away from things
idk
Heh

better that your legs are out rather than your arms
Am I gonna be able to walk tomorrow? Jury's out
My legs are so sore
Holy fuck

os?
So
yiiike good luck cindy
kinda wish I just went back to campus but also there's 0 chance I would actually get up at 8:30 if they weren't around to force me
maybe longer
this is actually the first time I've shared a hotel room w family in like 3 years
lol
I forgot how much I hate my dad's snoring
ok I slept like an hour last night and I tried to sleep at 10 but that Clearly Did Not Work Out
rip you and the coughing
man
I wasn’t even trying to, I got sick and coughing kept me up until 3 every day
good work bud
I hate this so much
Ughhhhhj it looks like I no longer possess the ability to sleep before 3
the same thing can also be correlated with this physical "recovery"
so essentially, if he WAS seeing an SLP (speech and lang pathologist), they were failing to ensure that he was following his care plan -- but iirc there's no evidence that he was going to an SLP/PT/OT
basically his family is accused of neglecting his treatment, which is evidenced by his speech regression
about the family comment I made earlier
anyway
yikes.
/end (for real)
and that's the story of Tom Brier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVP2b9UmNEM&t=90s
"*With Tom's accident happening just a week before the 2016 Sutter Creek Ragtime Festival, it was too late to change the schedules, so for Tom's first scheduled set, it was decided that several musicians would come up and play either something composed by Tom, arranged by Tom or that they have played with Tom in the past...
 All the while, a rootbeer float waits on a table next to the piano. Tom always ordered a rootbeer float here at the Ice Cream Emporium, so one was ordered for him as a symbolic gesture."*
the story may best be summed up with a part of the description of one of the videos directly following the accident, which goes like this:
and a brilliant mind, trapped for what may be eternity
with a brain that can't communicate his compositions
in a body that can no longer perform music
but either way, Tom Brier still exists out of a wheelchair
and that his family is secretly plotting against Tom to keep him captivated
there have been rumors circulating that Tom should instead be living in a rehabilitation center instead of an assisted living community
but when it all came together, Tom rejected the idea, almost repulsively
and at first, he seemed to become excited at the idea
he had created an acrylic model of a note staff and music notation for Tom to arrange on a table
A friend of his offered Tom a chance at composing music again
eventually Tom stopped speaking altogether, reverting to simple thumbs up or down as affirmative or negatives
there have been reports that Tom was able to play a handful of chords and scales on a miniature keyboard with his left hand, but he still was bound to a wheelchair, and his speech had regressed to a simple yes or no
months grew to years
but as months passed, he remained in the facility
there were moments where Tom seemed recover bit by bit, either regaining some motion in his right hand, beginning to put together simple phrases, and even chuckling at jokes that his friends would make when they would visit him
he was discharged from the hospital and entered into assisted living
the best he could offer was a silent gaping of his mouth as a laugh, or a cradled hand to an eye of which no tears fell
a few of his friends tried to get him to compose music, talk about the festivals that he had missed out on, and while he couldn't muster a clear response, he was able to make them understand that he could comprehend what they were saying
once taken off sedatives, Tom was in stable condition, but had suffered severe brain injury, no longer able to move his right side, talk, or even move his eyes
he was taken into intensive care, where he spent the next month on sedatives and breathing through an assisted respirator
the accordion-style crash left him with a punctured lung, broken ribs, and a coma
that is because a few days before this video was uploaded, Tom was involved in a serious car accident
it's a tape of him performing The Entertainer during a festival, and is unfortunately one of the last videos we might have of him performing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCOfiMsoZqI
the last recorded video of him playing live was uploaded in 2016
Wait what
sorry
hey hey no spoilers
from what i can see his family is trash
He's essentially one of the most revered and respected pianists of our time
Also, ragtime for piano is so fun
Bruh sightreading was/has always been my biggest weakness as far as musical skills go so. Goddamn. Mad respect
He's played at ragtime festivals and has acted as a judge for several youth ragtime competitions
His demonstration of him just sight-reading music is enough to tell you how good he is
Can I suggest this one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwVKDP8nzQ
He's considered to be one of the greatest modern ragtime musicians/composers of our time
Yo holy shit
This is famous ragtime musician and composter Tom Brier sight-reading the Athletic Theme from Super Mario

what's up
alright
So I'm gonna put it here and maybe one of you guys will meander through it
I wanna share this story that I found out about basically an hour ago but I have no audience or place to do so
I had a really mild headache this morning but coffee cured it
perfectly normal
How are you feeling nowish?
I feel mostly fine which is very unusual
I ended up sleeping at around 8 for like an hour and a half
this is the mildest all-nighter-hangover I've ever experienced
Nice job, Cindy! Get some rest.
I'm going to sleep
I HAVE ~2 PAGES LEFT
wack
I’ve been awake since 6 am
Huh this time zone difference is weird
<:JS:605632750858403840> <:JS:605632750858403840> <:JS:605632750858403840>
kay you too Imma go back to work night fam
Do sleep though
thanks
*sad doot*
<:KZ:607334139493875760>
I don't have class till 11 though and it's not due till 3, so hopefully I'll sleep a little. I legit feel fine though which is kinda weird
would like it to be good, which means spending time that I should've spent over the course of like a week
unfortunately, I actually care about this essay so
Why?
Oh no
btw, this might end up being the first all-nighter of my college career
;)
go to sleep
oh no I see jarrett
I'm like. genuinely concerned that anyone besides me is still awake rn lmao
is this something I just regularly sleep through?
why are people being loud in the hallway at 4:30 am on a sunday night
Hope you're doing a bit better
I feel, Helen. I've had an awful cough all week too.
feel better
L
aw babe that's not stupid at all 😦 get well soon
This is so stupid
I can’t sleep because of coughing again
I haven’t had a large serving of caffeine in a while
Lmao
I fidget a lot more and if I drink enough I start like vibrating constantly, lol
i don't usually Feel more energetic post-caffeine but I notice that my body physically has more energy
Or I’m just over the sleepiest part of my day which is 3-4 pm usually
I do feel more awake after the side but it may be a placebo effect
Lmao
both is good
now I'm thinking both
hmmm
Nap
after class should I get coffee or take a nap
coffee not soda
I need some fucking cocaine
Side tangent but I recently learned that the position of a frat on the status tier heavily correlates with the amount of cocaine they have at parties
It’s easier to obtain caffeine than cocaine
It’s all about access
Why use caffeine to stay awake when a healthy dose of cocaine is all you need?
I’m so desperate to stay awake that I’m drinking soda for the caffeine
There goes my morning work time
Lmao I just woke up
technically chibi
then again we are one foot in the grave because my current profile pic could be considered anime
... L
there's a certain sadness in not being able to change your profile pic to a cute anime girl because you still need your opinion to matter
because it is
i feel like the shit that goes down keeps escalating. it's crazy.

cindy's action
No I'm confused if you're saying it about something you said or about Cindy's actione
it's an unconscious slip of true intentions

Just starting watching this movie called The Host
Past 2 am and I don't plan on sleeping
Past 2 am and I can’t fall asleep
Nice!
That was actually really fun though
Was up at 7:30 and didn't even get coffee
Agree
I'm so tired networking is fucking exhausting lmao
I will dramatically encourage you to consume calories
E a t
I'm being dramatic dw
I will soonish
Do you have access to food?
I'm so hungry help :(
The business conference not the sex toy startup
Whoa that’s cool
Yes
we need a business division for our smart sex toy startup
get that $$$
I'm at a business conference
I told y'all last night I had to get up early today
I wasn't sure if I'd be able to make 7 hours while having to wake up for registration
9:30 wow
I'm really surprised at Friday
Nice
This week in sleep
I slept for 4 hours, idk if that’s a good change
but I'm glad to see we're making changes
waking up at reasonable times has never been our strong point
good job guys
wow
oh I keep forgetting about that
it's 12:30 here
Yea why are any of you up?
it's 9 am for you why the hell are you awake
I was so alarmed for a sec bc I saw 6 am
Guess I’ll just starve
I’m hungry and thirsty but don’t want to get out of bed
I bet saturday night
I agree with gene
I give it a week
I bet two weeks from now
We should make bets on the next time Cindy has to evacuate in the middle of the night
Time to go back to the dead thanks for keeping me company I hate that this is a regular thing
Aight I'm back in my room god bless
That's actually really cool
They're the ones that decided on it
Hey Boeing foots the bill
Plus you didn't even live there
Wow that is
Which is crazy
Also it was more expensive per year than WSU
Basically all wealthy kids of international business men
Korean specifically? Huh that's interesting
But we had like 20% Korean pop at the school
No it is
And Sammamish has a decent number of Asians
Oh, international school
I mean I've never been so idk
Germany's not That white is it?
Yes?
Germany?
um
Yeah
Remember Germany and Sammamish were most of my life so far
Damn lmao
Oh my god, the number of white people here
It's insane, I've never been around this many white people before
And the school as a whole is like ridiculously diverse to be clear. Van is actually a majority minority city and we have fuckloads of international students
Since I'm on a ramble this is tangentially related another thing I've noticed is that my classes are heavily white-people-dominated which is kinda depressing but not surprising I guess since a lot of these people are gonna be future politicians and bureaucrats and economists and shit
I actually don't think I've seen anyone use it yet though
I've heard Molly is usually common at colleges
Also about same here Cindy
Molly seems to be becoming more common around here
Idk it's just what I've found by like talking to people
how does one discover what a place's primary drug is?
The primary drug here that isn't alcohol or weed is Adderall, and it's rarely used at parties/for recreation, I feel like that says a lot tbh
As usual
Oh right
I was gonna say something else but I forgot
But I think those are the only 2 exceptions to the most-people-are-studious thing I've observed
Literally everyone was like whomst the fuck
And only to poli, probably because there's no way they weren't straight up failing, exams in that class are absolutely brutal
Oh funny thing there's 2 white guys who have come to class literally never who just started showing up a few days ago
But Mason is just doing his own thing
It's smart
Lol
They basically all have to meet up for study hours to stay part of the frat
Yea, most of the frats require you to spend a certain number of hours a week studying in the library
Yeah actually something that surprised me but maybe shouldn't have is that even the hardcore partiers here are usually pretty studious
L
But he's paying like $25,000 a year to do that
All three which he's very successful at
Other than to smoke, party, and meet girls
Yea not sure why he's here
Wack
Did I mention he's taking out loans for college
Damn ok
Holy
And we only have 3 weeks left
Who dropped 3 of his 5 classes last week
Like my friend Mason
Or more specifically "see Hard Work, say fuck that and then go Party Hard"
Work Hard, Party Hard
Lol, that seems to just ramp it up around here
Though it's slowed down a Lot now that school has intensified a lot
aint no fire alarm if someone dies
well at least they're not being annoying
Idk a bunch of people have been hospitalized for alcohol
potheads are the exact demographic i would expect to keep on setting off the fire alarm at the dead of night and not care
Hey just be glad people aren't dying like at WSU
I was actually asleep
Ugh I just hate people it always happens on the worst days too
Habits are chemically built into our brain at a certain level
Psychological not physiological but yeah
Which you could argue is a type of addiction
Like it's habit not dependence
*yes*
Isn't marijuana not even addictive though
^
potheads gonna be potheads
It's like asking an alcoholic to stop drinking all the time
That makes total sense then
Y es
Oh damn, so people are just lighting up and setting it off
This is like the 8th time
Automatic
I have friends who smoke that's fine cool. but it's not even that cold rn just fucking step outside
Is it the automatic fire alarms or the manuel ones?
I have an exam tomorrow
They're literally taking resources away from the city bc they're fucking dumbasses
I'm getting more and more enjoyment out of this every time
Like I'm confused are the people who are doing this not getting punished or what
Wow
Idk if it's even worth posting about anymore but guess who just had to evacuate in the middle of the night again??
peak fun
Dafuq are line integrals
good to hear
update: math midterm studying going 40% better than previously projected
i will imagine a cup of tea
thanks for the thought
I feel like the worst part of us being at different schools is that I can't offer you a cup of warm Alishan Oolong in these trying times
a terrible but nearly inevitable combination
now it's sad boi + midterm studying hours
lmao
that's a Wen-type move
ooh you go girl
Too late I’m at dinner 😛
Study for a bit
I’m torn between eating dinner now or studying
Like 60-70%
Warm water by itself will clean to an extent
As long as it's not a super heavy wash setting
Yeah, it should be fine
It's fine if I wash it twice in a row right?
And from playing lots of tennis recently
Since a lot of clothes got really dirty from the snow
Yeah I thought so too, but I decided to run it through one more time with detergent
It's usually fine if you miss detergent for one week. It's still getting mostly cleaned, and there's often residual detergent in clothes from their last wash.
F
😭
I just did laundry and stuff and now I remember I forgot to put detergent in when I washed it.
Ignore the title
Here's another for good measure
https://nhentai.net/g/252544/
Second is a little less than aight
Third is aight
The first is quite good
No
Is this the wrong chat mayhaps?
Hmmm
https://nhentai.net/g/166499/
https://www.tsumino.com/entry/45950
https://nhentai.net/g/107454/
Sure why not
I can give you some consolation links if you'd like
Cause I can't find any numbers
No numbers for you
?
They dont really exist
I stand corrected
Hmm
?
Ah shit the ones I have on hand are from a different site
Gimme
Cause I've got numbers
Are you looking for numbers
I mean
As hentai has taught us, +12" only
Intresting but not super useful
3 inches on a girl would be something
Hmmmmm
Depends ;)
is three inches a lot?
Cindy and me are 5' 6"
Yea that's what I would have guessed
i vaguely remember being considered tallish in china but i haven't visited since the summer before 6th grade
however
I also haven't really grown since then
maybe 3"
i'm 5'4" i think?
idk I haven't been back to china in years
but I feel like there's enough who are above that range that 5'2 shouldn't be the average
now that I think about it/reevaluate/ignore helen and salina as outliers most chinese girls I know are like 5' to 5'2
I feel like I'm slightly shorter than you
And I'm dead even with you
huh really?
Jane is decently shorter than me
No she's not
jane's like close to my height
or maybe I just have a skewed perspective bc I've been friends w you two for so long lmao
I feel like the avg chinese girl I've met here is taller than that though
Man we gotta save the elephants
no way
what??
Average height is 5’2” can you believe it
Sad facts of life
In China that is
Well I’m basically an elephant compared to other Chinese girls lmao
sometimes a small, sometimes a medium
Depends
Cause I'm an American small
Okay Noah what size clothes do you wear anyways?
as a general rule asian clothes are consistently smaller
Too small or too big?
It’s hard for me to find fitting clothes in China
Very smol and delicate
._.
Well you are very petite
i am not petite
0 petite
0P?
it weird sometimes
i can wear some 0P clothes
Yeah but tall people are inherently bigger
you're not that big
It’s wack that I’m still a women’s small
it's kinda depressing you can tell the influence obesity has had lmao
american sizing is kinda wack tbh even if you compare to like the UK
cuz over there I'm a medium but here I'm a small
I find so much more shit in my size in stores over there
it's one I recommend
a world to explore in the future
hmmmmmm
american
that's an excellent point
actually
commercial american or commercial asian range
smaller band
30c
Too big or too small?
this is really random but I got a new bra on amazon and holy fuck!! the best-fitting Legit bra I've ever tried, I'm torn between being super happy and upset that it's a size outside of the typical commercial range
r i p
Yesterday after talking about sleep I thought, “what the heck do I even do past 10pm, certainly not work...might as well sleep earlier” and then had to stay up until 2 doing legitimate emergency work
Weather looks perfect for a evening run
well that's good
Just woke up, I slept for about 100 minutes
I also usually work out 10-11 and occasionally past midnight if I'm feeling extra restless
I'm definitely the wrong person to ask about going to bed earlier though LMAO
it gives me the illusion of free will
this is also how I plan weekends and vacations tbh like I can't attach things to time, 'cause first of all I'm shit at estimating how long I will want to spend on a certain thing, but also I like the flexibility/figuring shit out as I go
I make a lot of to-do lists/write tasks out by priority and keep track of deadlines but that's about it
and then i just do whatever
i keep time mgmt markers throughout the weeks for what i want to accomplish on which days
i think i'm somewhere in the middle
but I Can't have a strict schedule, I can't have a constant routine, I get too bored of my life lmao
which has resulted in a much more chaotic life
I take pretty much the exact opposite approach to alan
For me, sleeping more than 8 hours means I have too much energy by the time it's time to go to bed the following night
Another trick to sleeping regularly is remembering to not get too much sleep
If more, no
If it’s like 20 mins sure
Is 4 pm a good time to take a nap
Now I know, registration would be better on WiFi
Download is 72 but upload is 92
Actually I just tested Ethernet
Bork Bork
It bluescreens at least once a month
my laptop likes to bork itself too
I can’t test the Ethernet rn unfortunately because my laptop borked
mbps
mbpa
Internet speed?
Wdym 300
The Ethernet gives us 300 or so though
In comparison our wifi is pretty good
Rip
I get like, two bars on the UW wifi from my desk
We almost certainly don't
Every room has an individual WiFi unit thing if that makes a difference
I don’t really understand how WiFi works but I haven’t had problems with mine so far
But it's crowded and slows to a crawl in the evenings
Probably because UW wants us to use the dorms pre-installed stuff
Why can’t you have your own?
But we're running with it
Lmaooooooo
Which is technically against the rules
Ken and I have our own router
But I still ended up in a good writing class so it’s all good
Ethernet cable was not the way to go
Lol my roommate and I were trying to get into the same writing class and she got in while I did not despite the fact that I gave her tech tips on how to register faster
It'll probably suck but I'll get the best I can
I'll be anxious (because I'm me) but at least I know when I'll have to fight
Yay!
I don’t think I’ll ever be this anxious about registration
update: I'm on the 542
college.
Apparently she was also crying yesterday due to registration
This morning was the last registration day and I woke up promptly at 7 this morning to the sound of some girl screaming and crying down the hall
I'm miffed
Also the 542 bus has been at 3 minutes out for the last 3 minutes
I'd aim for At 7 but you know yourself better than I do
That sounds good
I guess if I really got into the habit of sleeping at like 11 every night I could wake up before 7
You could just Wake Up Earlier, but that's up to the person
I much prefer exercising in the morning over other times of day but my schedule won’t allow it
Oh same, that's why I give myself 3 and a half hours for gym and breakfast
The thing is exercising here makes me stupidly sweaty for some reason so I always have to shower afterwards lol
I have to reserve about 20 minutes of bus travel time before class and getting ready sometimes takes a while
Going to the gym in the morning seems scary, but it actually gets easier if you don't think about it and immediately go from bed to gym with no inbetween
If you wake up at 8 you can hit the gym for about an hour and still fit in breakfast I think
But about 3 of them is a dance class
About 16.5 class hours per week which is a decent amount of time
Next quarter is gonna suck more since I have the last possible registration date lol
Next semester is a bit more regular but I will still have like no gym time
Right now I'm in class at the earliest at 11:30 and always out by 4:30
Yeah mine is kinda wack rn
This kind of strict planning heavily depends on your class schedule though
I guess I have some semblance of a routine but it changes depending on what needs to be done from day to day
Here's the latest version
(the schedule I sent is a little out of date)
Wake up? Hit the gym.
Monday after math? Laundry and chores.
After class? Library.
6:30? Time for dinner. Now.
Yeah, but I'm just letting it happen
The hard part is when you just have to drop something that's almost finished
Wouldn’t you have to know what time it is in order to switch tasks
I don't technically keep track either, I just switch tasks whenever the time comes to switch
This actually works pretty well in most situations except in going to sleep I guess
I usually don’t keep track of time when I do things
There's a bit of flex when crunch time inevitably comes, but for the most part my time is budgeted to the minute
I'm never supposed to be working when I'm supposed to be relaxing, and vice versa
I schedule free time with as much priority as work time
I think I spend too much time online at night
I just kind of live day by day lol
Wow you have a schedule
True maybe I should try that
You don't have to be as strict as I am with my time, but for me it works
For me just flat out stopping myself from doing work past 10 PM helps
Using my fitbit as an alarm made it so much easier to wake up since you're not tempted to go on your phone immediately after turning off your alarm
Don’t count the Wednesday 😛
It’s pretty cool but my data is depressing
I have a Fitbit like that actually
It'll tell you not just when you slept, but how soundly and in what stages
getting a fitbit/watch that can actually measure your sleep
Make a before go to sleep routine
Does anyone have advice on how to motivate yourself to improve your sleep schedule/sleep earlier
the face not so much
the ass is designed for cushioning
well better than your face
but i'm pretty butthurt about it
granted, carpeted
i slipped down half a flight of stairs earlier today
L
are you holding up alright?
aww, i'm sorry, helen
I just want to go home lol
an excuse to get away from some shit maybe? soft reset on life?
again, like no particular reason lmao
Is there a specific reason?
I love Toronto!
Ooh

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little \"clever\" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
<@470822754262712329>
Idk
Yes?
are you... ok
It's really specific and really random
I have a sudden urge to move to Toronto for some reason
This is a all-night-long contest to see whether I or these 3D printers work slower
*luck
Oof good lick to you too
And a mini paper that's like, 6-10% I think for a fourth class
I have 3 essays that are each like 20% of my grade in all 3 classes
Good luck
Oof
Fuck me I have two midterms next week in the two classes that matter the most
I think it’s applicable enough to place most people somewhere
I would wanna add a weeb axis but I'm not sure how applicable it is to everyone
i gues so?
(lenny)
He must mean smash bros
what do you mean???
I've basically smashed everyone here
I could give everyone an accurate rating I feel like
yes
yeah
actual smashing or...?
can we add smashing to the axes
likelihood to fail nnn
lawful/chaotic
wholesomeness/degeneracy
rip
what're our axes now?
FUCK
axes
asexes
axises
axieses?
axi?
what're our axis now
you are the orderliest
so, so orderly
so orderly
im very orderly
what
> jane and jarrett sitting in a tree, c h a o t i c
AHA
yes
<@470822754262712329> i know you care
and controlling starbot
jeff bezos is monitoring us
honestly I don't really care
<@470822754262712329> i have so many people i could talk to
do you really not have anyone to talk to besides a lifeless bot?
<@470822754262712329> you lil bitch
his responses just feel a little too fitting
because sometimes
sometimes I really do wonder if he's got something else controlling him
is that any way to talk to your daddy
Nuuuuu I love <@470822754262712329>
so that's the kinda thing you're into, huh?
wow
no u
nobody likes you
fuck off starbot
honestly both sound good but we haven't had a chart yet and now that I think about it idk how that hasn't happened
We can come up with funny category titles
Should we do a graph or categories like I did?
yes
Are we making a degeneracy alignment chart?
Y'all talking about spreadsheets
break all the dimensions
more axes
Create lots of graphs
no
We could have multiple different y-axes
Alan that was brilliant
and I don't think most likely to fail nnn is particularly correlated w degeneracy tbh
:/
noah stahp
you can't it's november
Other scale could be sad boi-ness
Sure
fuck you noah
no fuck you
....
is starbot broken
come get your child
alan
WOw
you shut the fuck up
noah shut the fuck up
That’s correlated to degeneracy
Salina is the most holesome
looool
likelihood to fail nnn
what should the y axis be
but you're pretty neutral
I would put you slightly more on the wholesome side
I’m neutral on the wholesome - degenerate chart
that's called denial cindy
such deep deep denial
you're in denial
so so sinful
he's sinful now
no one can convince me otherwise
he's BABY
gene doing degenerate things =/= gene being degenerate
so so bad
Yes we need a custom alignment chart!
it's so bad
true
yes
false
degenerate now
I LOVE THAT
gene is so

wholesome - degenerate
one axis is obvious
let me show you the present i made for my roommate
we need a wholesome degenerates alignment chart
is that a pun?
puns?
I see the kind of brain cells you have salina
i am not the chaotic friend
woah it totally does
aha!
that actually kind of works
wait
jane and jarrett sitting in a tree, c h a o t i c

that's a kid
i'm not chaotic!

he's sending you his aggressive energy
Nani the fuck did you just fucking iimasu about watashi, you chiisai bitch desuka? Watashi’ll have anata know that watashi graduated top of my class in Nihongo 3, and watashi’ve been involved in iroirona Nihongo tutoring sessions, and watashi have over sanbyaku perfect test scores. Watashi am trained in kanji, and watashi is the top letter writer in all of southern California. Anata are nothing to watashi but just another weaboo. Watashi will korosu anata the fuck out with vocabulary the likes of which has never been mimasu’d before on this continent, mark watashino fucking words. Anata thinks anata can get away with hanashimasing that kuso to watashi over the intaaneto? Omou again, fucker. As we hanashimasu, watashi am contacting watashino secret netto of otakus across the USA, and anatano IP is being traced right now so you better junbishimasu for the ame, ujimushi. The ame that korosu’s the pathetic chiisai thing anata calls anatano life. You’re fucking shinimashita’d, akachan.
<@470822754262712329> any remarks
any time
Thanks for the support guys
because what else is there to do but enjoy the times in life that don't suck
Only 16 hours to go
enjoy it
and when it does
Which is good
but that next time that it doesn't suck will arrive
I think things will get better after 11 am tomorrow tbh
(lenny)
maybe it won't give you a break inbetween
maybe stronger
maybe weaker
the suck will return
once that's over and done with, life goes back to sucking less
it's probably immediately after your math midterm
you already know when that is
and the neat thing?
get to the next point in life that doesn't suck
so you can basically sum up your current goal as thus:
lemme know if you wanna talk about anything
but there's always gotta be another time that doesn't suck somewhere along the road
yeah that sounds like a trainwreck but you'll get through it babe
it's just getting through the times that do suck that are hard
is sometimes enough
but just remembering that life doesn't *always* suck
there's no real other way to put it besides that really
anything we can do to help?
some times more than others
oh nooooo
sometimes
life sucks
Awe helen that really really sucks
how're you holding up
ouch
...............................................................
This week I:
- cried three hours in two sessions and hyperventilated once due to an insult directed at someone else
- have an essay outline due tomorrow that I’m dreading writing tonight 
- have registration tomorrow morning that I have to wake very early for
- cannot get a replacement for my broken laptop charger in time for the activities listed above
- ate trash all week and probably gained two pounds which I blame on stress
- have to study for a math midterm next week 
- tried to make new friends because some of my current ones are trash
It’s was almost 70 today
straight up binged on thai food when I visited home last month. lol
I will say that from what I've experienced, the thai food here is kinda disappointing compared to what I'm used to 😠
vancouver's gorgeous and there's always something happening in the city
school has been p great! I like all my classes, though sociology is probably my least favorite. I'm doing super well in poli, joined some cool clubs, made some cool friends
How about you?
that's good to hear
ooooh
But besides that I'm pretty good here, dining hall food is pretty good, I found a really good Thai restaurant nearby to go to with friends
Tbh I'm getting my ass kicked in chemistry and programming right now
seriously considering randomly ordering delivery
I suddenly got hit with the strongest craving for good asian food
otherwise how's umich treating you?
rip
Yeah the wind is awful
it usually feels a lot colder than it actually is here 'cause we're right on the ocean, the wind can get really intense
wind chill? and also the snow
I never realized 30 degrees felt so cold
It was 30 degrees fahrenheit today
it was pretty cold for like a week? but I don't think it's broken freezing yet
yeah it's still like 40-50 and sunny here
Damnit haha
oof
Get got
Am out on the rooftop terrace in a t shirt right now
Like if I don't put my hands in my pocket they start hurting after a couple minutes
It's so cold
I want snow too
Crazy
Early november and snowing over here
Dude it was snowing this morning
yes
is seasonal depression kicking in already????
I am inexplicably Sad and Unmotivated today
I'll email that one lol
i can send walzer here but McMahan is too powerful (44 pages)
<@!472541429130854421> if you've got a min, try resending?
also discord says that the files are 0 bytes o.O
huh it's giving me a "failure to load pdf document"
they sound the same and I agree with whoever i'm currently reading
all the semantics are flying over my head
if you read them and come to some enlightening conclusion on the similarities/differences between their arguments could you let me know? lol
thanks lol
Good luck!!;
Yikes dude
i haven't progressed in two hours
same i should do work lol
I am but maybe later I don't wanna get Too sidetracked lol
i have way more from this class if you're interested
❤️
~~Me: reads other peoples' reading assignments to procrastinate own my own~~
Hell fucking yeah
They are pretty interesting, so sure
And if you have said readings in PDF form can I have them 👀
Ye
Is this for your ethics in war class
But thanks for offering lol
Unless you’ve read McMahan and Walter’s arguments on why terrorism is bad, then practically speaking not really
Is there any way I can help?
Yiiike, I'm sorry
I have an essay outline due tomorrow and I still don’t really understand the papers I’m supposed to be analyzing
I was supposed to meet people for dinner 5 mins ago lmao
Ok highkey I'm in a similar situation rn WHERE IS MY DAMN BUS
Ooooof
🇫
I love life
But this route was supposed to get me back by like 5:15
I’m so sorry I’m so salty about this on a routine basis
so many people skipped earlier classes today to cram for poli I should've done it
I love how I've reached a point in my life where I'm too lazy to go to my room to brush my teeth and sleep
this chapter is SO LONG holy fuck
I mean it depends on what you got/made
ehh?
Ultra strong black coffee, also know as the coffee at the bottom of the mug
Approved move
Ordering tea on a coffee date
night hun
Speaking of which, I should probably sleep. Sorry to be abrupt. I have a morning class lol. G'night!
Might wake me up considering I'm about to fall over
I'd be willing to try that sometime lol
Ooohhh interesting
literally heavenly
but it's gelato with an espresso shot poured over
well, most coffee is an italian thing
lol it's an italian thing
That's a word?
ever tried affogato?
bitter bean juice!!!!
Olivia didn't need to know that
like I love it now but it's an acquired taste and I chug it now but I still grimace sometimes when it's Ultra Strong
well, not a great thing to start with, not gonna lie
oh.
That I could drink a cup of black coffee
what point
But that was part of the point I was trying to prove
Probably would've enjoyed it more if I added anything into it
were you one of the friends who'd never tried it?
how about the taste
lmfao
Won't ever live up to cocaine though
Not quite the same as being tea drunk, but I definitely said and did a couple of questionable things due to the excess energy
did the caffeine have an impact at all
thoughts?
nah you're good
Sorry to disappoint
Tbh, I'm still not really sure. I don't know my coffee.
what'd you get
oooh
But then I ordered a cup of coffee a half hour in to prove a point
yeah ok that's what I thought
going on a coffee date is not the same as actually ordering and drinking a coffee
Tea
did you actually get coffee
Jonathan was mainly confused cuz he knows I don't drink coffee yet I agreed to get coffee
Sean straight up told us he's been waiting to see who would have sex in the room first and then immediately asked about that
"can I get some fucking cocaine???"
lol
but I guess it works out well
Apparently I'm the party animal now
Yeah, idk
that's kinda surprising actually
Sean is probably not
Jonathan is definitely not
are either of your roommates partiers?
damn lmao
Sean didn't even flinch and just started clapping though. It was kinda weird. Salina and Jane were there too, so we all kinda died on the inside.
I don't think I told him about either of these things in advance though, so he was pretty shook when I had to explain to him
this weekend was prime time to go to a party if you ever were going to though lol
ah rip
Etc.
Woke up early for that
Rushed back cuz I realized I had the morning thing
Got urged by a friend to check out a party (wasn't my scene, but at least I know now)
I mentioned it in the other channel
what were you doing though?
assuming it's a weekend
...I wouldn't worry I would assume sleepover or sex tbh
rip
So from his perspective, it's like I never came back last night, so I feel kinda bad for worrying him
Cuz like he slept while I was out, and I left in the morning before he woke up
My roommate Jonathan was hella confused with where I was last night lol
Lmao
ok good
Might be about 15 minutes tho
I'm actually getting readyish for bed as we speak lol
n o
go to bed
oh yikes
Your health is important, and I'm glad you're catching up on sleep one way or another
Granted, maybe I'm just envious cuz I got 3 hours of sleep last night, but it still checks out lol
You did dun the good
I wholeheartedly support this decision
lol I slept till one and then napped from 3-6
So I'm proud of you
And it sounds like you did a good job taking care of yourself earlier today
Well, I'm glad to hear that at least
I'm actually being productive now so it's aight I think
Hopefully that changes soonish though
I'm sorry
Awww, Cindy
anyways, now I can't sleep lmao
I'm not exaggerating when I say I spent 80% of today in bed recovering from the past 2 days
Anyways, g'night
I didn't think I'd age this fast
But yeah, ima sleep, get on getting a good pair of sunglasses, and probably finally find a nice ass sunscreen
I got a lot of work done on a personal project and then had an interesting extended conversation about politics and history
And in my defense, I wasn't staying up for homework
But like wrinkles
Bags
No, not like
Idk what to do
go to sleep
yikes man
I lowkey think that I starting to develop wrinkles under my eyes
alan what the fuck
i'm gonna cry
yikes what is happening
real canadian bourbon-aged maple syrup is the correct fucking way
get outta here with your fake ass bullshit
as a motherfucking patriot I am OFFENDED at this goddamn blasphemy
and she lets people take her top off, but you'll probably have sticky hands after
she makes breakfast 300% better
the words "thick and rich" are on her apron
excuse me?
what the fUCK
is mrs. butterworth the ideal milf
yikes! time to play be-as-quiet-as-possible-while-taking-a-shower-at-ungodly-hours
when did this happen
yo what the fuck how is it 1 am already
it was a long night
completely forgot about that message
Looool
You gotta throw in a "I know it has been 17 years since you were raw dogging it, and I'm sorry that having me made you realize it really wasn't worth it"
`having kids` not raising kids
She said `......................coding, and having kids`
Yup
I know
Good work
my original plan was to write and leave a card at home but I forgot to do that while I was at home
🌎 🌎 🌎
I could thank for the (1, 17) range I suppose
Hello world
I actually kinda love that
For all of your coding parent needs
I saw that
lmfao
I need to go into marketing
God
In this episode of bad design choices
lol
We don’t talk about that possibility
Shhhh
Damn
they might disown me yet
Or just do something fun like that
Print(thanks for not disowning me)
i hope something presents itself
For i in range (1, 18)
no worries
I'll figure something out thanks guys
hm
flowers is a potentially good idea
Make a card
Idea
Solid repertoire
lol
honestly idk what she's doing with her life now that I'm gone
Great
......................coding, and having kids
What interests does she have
Um
Sorry sorry
Thoughts and prayers
maybe you could order flowers online to your house in sammamish?
does anyone have ideas on what I can send my mom for her birthday
but it's interesting to hear about
it's a butt ton of research to get right if you need to write about it
i find social history alright. i don't think i can say i find it as fascinating as other people though
I think this is a big reason why Bede liked but also hated me
it sounds shitty when I say it and I've gotten shat on for saying it but I'm not particularly interested in a lot of social  history
unless we talking trebuchets
that's valid
i can't get super into military history ngl
that's kinda my thing
I've been really into military history for p much as long as I can remember
history is just so broad that it's hard to be interested in all of it
oof i feel that
i wish my professors viewed me like i viewed this fly.
"this test is shit, but what if this guy's the next genius?"
anyways I do love history I just like some parts a lot more than others
guess the world will never know
a record-breaking specimen
what if it's like
ok, but this fly is a chonker
lmao i mean, i guess ya gotta learn to love history to survive a 3-hour lecture every week
murder its ass
you're too nice gene
it was unbelievably dull. things have picked up considerably now though lol it's not too bad
i don't have the heart to kill it, but i don't wanna open the window and let in its biting brethren
the first day, I sat front row and was constantly on the brink of falling asleep while my prof rambled for 2.5 hours on the 1900 paris exposition
it's an absolute unit
there's a stupid ass fly that got stuck in the study room with me
is it interesting at least?
that's completely valid
but that almost feels like a completely different class, we don't really talk about what we're actually doing in lecture
I have discussion and/or tutorial sessions with the TAs later
monday only
oh, is it like a monday or tuesday thing?
i might try to frontload my schedule next quarter and try to be done with shit by early afternoon
at the same time I kinda like knocking it out early in the week and not having to think about it for the rest of the time
daaaamn
yeah it's rough mate lmao
3-hour history lecture??
it's the culprit for the majority of my mid-afternoon caffeine intake
I do have 1 break between my more regular classes and my once-a-week 3-hour history lecture
so i guess mine is still easier than yours in that sense
granted, there's some space in between
oh rip
i have a 9:30 tomorrow and have class until 5
hell, actually
i mean, of the few days i do get to sleep in, i have that too
like the flipside is that I'm not done till 6 pm lmao
mondays are my longest days though
i'm not gonna lie
i'm straight up jealous
it's prob just from having a shit sleep routine tbh
I don't have class till 11 so this is pretty early for me
although i might head to sleep at around 1
if it helps, i'm right here with you
awww, cindy
ok idk why but I'm having Major Trouble sleeping today so i guess I am gonna try to do some actual work
Surely it's a sign of the the of times
I'm the first of my roommates to wake up today
Welp, folks, looks like the world's ending today
uw wifi has been kinda an L all day
tbh
talk to y'all later loves
time to Actually grind
aight I made it to the library suite I actually live in these days
also idk how seattle is rn but it's literally disgusting in van rn
tbh except that one room I feel like the inside of suzzalo is kinda ugly
that's how slow
discord is taking like two seconds to send my messages
also suzzalo library is hella aesthetic but the wifi in here sucks
oh
despite the word "chai" meaning "tea"
only about half of chai is actually tea
why??
also wins my reward for "worst named drink"
see also: milk tea
chai falls under "mixed drinks" for me
chai lol
what kinda tea
nice
do you even like chai idk if I've asked
idk I was like it's cold and gross out but I've already had a large coffee today and also it's 4 pm
am I gonna suddenly wake up in Vancouver
is this a body swap situation
oh god
<@!478706068223164416> I ordered tea what's happening to us
guess it's time to grind
lol they like weren't super helpful
a week, no more, no less
no matter what happens, it'll all be over in a week
remember
I'll send you my organizational power
I'm sorry things are so busy right now
I really do hope things get better soon
Aww, Cindy :/
and also still being tired from traveling home, though that was completely worth it
which is not a flex just me cursing myself lmao
I suppose this is what happens when you intentionally take more and harder classes than recommended and also have a series of exams, job interviews and political events in a week
probably should've seen this coming tbh
I'm kinda just screaming into the void again
Regardless of whether you need validation or not, I'm mainly emphasizing that this is a viable option if you see it as potentially helpful, so you shouldn't feel guilty about pursuing it
I have another exam and like 3 major assignments due tomorrow plus another exam on tuesday plus an online quiz plus an essay due tuesday
I guess I'm hoping that advising can work something out with my profs
like honestly I don't need validation (though it's appreciated) I need solutions and I feel like I just flat-out have more Things To Do in such a short time that it's not feasible even at my peak efficiency
and even if they don't, we're always gonna be there for you
i promise you things are gonna get better
and that's perfectly fine. life gets in the way and shit happens. don't be too hard on yourself over it. you're doing a wonderful job whether you realize it or not
i mean, if you need to talk to advising instead of going to class, then go do that
I might have to bail on the backpacking trip this weekend I have so much shit happening
it's not really it's gonna add to the constant gnawing guilt BUT I think I need to talk to advising
and let us know if you need someone to talk about it with. we're always here for you, and you know that
skip class if that's what you need to do to feel better
i'm so sorry
awww, cindy
I think I'm gonna skip class
it's like completely unrelated to the health thing btw honestly picking a fight about that is a nice distraction but yeah that is also mostly my own fault
I'm like on the verge of freakout/breakdown
most of the nice buildings here are buildings no one even has classes in
why can't the uw chem labs be in a halfway decent building at the very least
the building is shitty
it's so far away
i have lab in half an hour and just really don't wanna fucking go
I'm sick
i don't know how to explain this
What the hell
hell yeah
then you'll give sean a lap dance?
I  R E Q U I R E  C O C A I N E
Lap Dance Gene
<@!520095106888630348> knows why this is hilarious
and i thought that was in response for another conversation
i'm having multiple discord conversations right now
i'm going to be completely honest
Litty titty
yeah it is
...i dont think thats it

Also can y'all send me your mailing addresses
And have like 5 extra things in my purse
L
I just realized I forgot to do face masks with y'all and now I'm sad
Awww Gene
LMAO
Not exactly a sad boi hours event, but it happened during sad boi hours: I got halfway through washing my face before I realized I accidentally used hand soap on my face. This is almost entirely inconsequential, but I somehow feel incredibly disappointed in myself.
I love how I thought I'd have more time to dedicate to hobbies and personal projects in college but instead ended up dropping everything since coming here
Is there a lost and found on campus?
I'm pretty sure I had it when I got back last night but Ive been looking for it all day
I currently can't find my student ID and I'm wondering if I should panic
I could scoot back to east rn
I love that
We have a ton of electric scooters everywhere for free
Ah I walk pretty far to get to our main rec center
The gym on East is pretty small, it just has the basics plus two racquetball courts for some reason
Nice
It's awesome
We have a lazy river
The pool is so empty
I just went swimming yesterday
Idk when peak hours are but definitely not mornings
Unless I'm rope climbing
I only go to the gym the hour before it closes lmao
even when I go at 9 AM it's still pretty crowded though
the peak time for the IMA here is about 6-9 PM
that's smart
During dinner time
the work out to read manga over tea routine is strong
I usually work out in the evenings nowadays
morning time is health/wellness time
I save that for the evening
I never do any academic work in the mornings before classes though
nice
keeping late start wednesdays going into college
Mondays and fridays 10 am, Tuesdays and thursdays 11:45, Wednesday’s 1:40
That’s my typical Wednesday
on tuesdays my first class is at 1
Dropping my 8:45 class was the move
Same for the most part
lol same
but the expectation/hope that I wouldn't
my schedule was made with the possibility of sleeping until 11
Lmaooooo
Lol my schedule involves waking up a max of 30 mins before class starts
I live day by day
My schedule is very haphazard compared to yours
just get boba
nice idea
Drink caffeinated tea?
it depends if I have a break between classes or not
well
10 is lunch?
class at 11:30
lunch at 10
gym at 9
wake at 8
my schedule usually goes
11:30
What time is your class?
lmao ripppppp
I'm starting to find it harder and harder to go to class after having my morning tea and it worries me
Yeah idk either but it is restful
That sounds like an innuendo
All I know is that it feels good when you go all the way
Napping is weird
Actually I don't know if that's healthy either
Gotta go all the way
I don't know if that's healthy
where I get really sleepy but not enough to actually pass out so I just lie on my bed in the dark in a state of half-consciousness for like 2 hours
I keep doing a weird half-nap thing
K
wtf why didn't that send
25
Maybe like....?
maybe like
not for too long but sure
Wanna come with?
<@340319804747415553>
Just around
where you walking
yo jarrett
im here for you my dude
alright. take care of yourself and stay safe
Gonna take a walk
Nah it's good
you wanna talk about it?
The saddest I have been in a while
This has been
The terrace closes at 10
design's been cool tho
math and chem are Ls tho
give it time
we've had 4 classes man
i'm not super upset over it yet though. it's just been a weird feeling.
i knew this would happen, but it's a really weird feeling
i guess we indirectly learned about the relationship between design, UX, and engineering. that 5 minute speal that existed to tell us what the class was about was the only interesting thing i've learned
while design class is cool, it's more of a design appreciation class, so i haven't *learned* anything
i am just realizing it's been a month and i haven't learned a single thing i'm genuinely interested in
i fell asleep before sean got out of the shower just waiting for a turn to brush my teeth lmao
i feel like it was less spilling tea and more just talking about whatever shit we wanted
My roommate kicked everyone out of our room and then is now hogging the bathroom while my other roommate sleeps. I still need to brush my teeth and whatnot, so I'm just sitting here in the dark with my phone lol. I love them (especially since they just spilled tea with us), but this is kinda a rip lmao.
dang bang donka
Yay!
I love Danganronpa
Dude
Lmao
dang bang donka
but I refer to it by its colloquial name
yes
ooooooh
It’s a murder mystery game
Spent 5 hours on that with some friends
nope
Have you guys heard of the Japanese visual novel game called Danganronpa?
I fell asleep at 5:30 AM and slept until exactly 12
what is my life
I slept at 4 last night till almost 1 this afternoon and then slept again from like 4 to just now
it may be 6 pm but i think this qualifies as sadboi hours
I've done absolute nothing today except eat sleep and say goodbye to a friend
I just like lying down on a couch I guess lol
Although only some of the episodes are from the classic seasons
I'm sitting in the lounge with some folks watching Spongebob
Anyways, I just remembered I have the tea appointment with Alan tomorrow, so g'night y'all whoops
I've also spent more time than I'd like to admit convincing myself that I could probably go through single and die alone yet be perfectly happy with that outcome (which is true to an extent)
My standards are simultaneously too high and too low
It's less of a matter of avoiding instant no situations and more of cobbling together enough positive attributes to generate interest. Some mildly to extremely wack traits may make that very hard, but in theory not impossible.
Like, the only things I could come up with off the top of my head:
-must be at least a decent person (e.g. if you're racist, yike)
-must not be literally on their deathbed when we start (although I felt bad saying this)
-must not be doing hard drugs
And that's hard to do in isolation, cuz the the thing is that I'd be willing to overlook certain things, but it's hard to cobble together enough reasons for me to be interested in any one reason to begin with
I think part of it was that I was being asked to consider factors that we're straight up hard nos from me
He had me scared, but it was still relatively unconvincing
Byung tried to prank me into thinking that he sent a photo of me to one of friends and they were interested in me
Who the hell knows
I might date a rock
Honestly
This shit is good for me to think about every now and then so my standards don't slip too low, but it's also kinda terrifying out of context
Me: Just because I'm single doesn't mean I'm desperate and have low standards.
Byung and Jane: Ok, what are your standards?
My last brain cell struggling to come up with a coherent thought: Oh no, these standards are really fucking low
I'm spoiled I can no longer function before like. 11
I need advil and caffeine asap
honestly I feel like absolute shit rn lol
and also needed to get up at like 8:30
I usually am awake during sadboi hours but I forced myself to sleep at 2 yesterday bc I have an exam today
didn't know either of them but lots of my friends did
Their names are Lucas Beirer and Tom Beatty. Any one know these names? Beatty sounds familiar.
https://www.kiro7.com/news/eastside-news/second-skyline-high-school-student-dies-of-overdose-in-less-than-2-months/992595551
Just another stray late-night thought with Gene
Idk, it's hard not to feel kinda out of the loop though. Like, it's great to see everyone growing, but not being around a lot of people to see it happen personally leaves me kinda curious.
Or is that just me?
I mean, hopefully most've of the change is for the better, but you can't help but think it feels kinda weird, right?
It's kinda bizarre not gonna lie.
Anyways, y'all ever find it weird to look around and see people in college changing so fast and start wondering how/if you're changing yourself?
Did y'all change into functional people on me?
Wack how almost no one's awake during sad boi hours anymore
"KIRO 7 reached out to Seattle Public Schools and asked what the district is doing to educate students about Gabe's death. The spokesperson was not aware of the teen's death. " YIKES
Was not the expert we thought them to be
O shit that drug expert
"The 16-year-old who died Monday was one of six deaths — five males and one female, ages 16 to 37 — who have died from fentanyl overdoses in the past week across King County, a number that includes a Seattle teenager, said Brad Finegood, a strategic adviser and drug expert for Seattle-King County Public Health. Between June and mid-September, another 141 people in King County have died from suspected or confirmed drug overdoses involving fentanyl, he said."
"A Seattle Police Department investigation that led to the arrest of a suspected drug dealer in Sammamish and the seizure of 12,000 fentanyl pills, other drugs, two handguns and $75,000 in cash on Sept. 13 is being looked at for possible connections to the teens’ deaths, the sheriff said."
police put out a statement, the majority of people dealing in King County are selling stuff with dangerous levels of synthetics. they're incentivized to do so bc the smaller the dosage needed to get people high as fuck and hooked, the higher the profit
the effects I'm quite well acquainted with
depends on what part we're talking about
idk if you know how drugs work
Idk if it's the street dealers cutting them with higher powered stuff
High risk high reward i guess
like you can be personally anti-drugs as much as you want, it's not gonna change that other people are gonna try them, and it's still upsetting and honestly tragic that these 16-year-olds are ODing because some street dealer took advantage of them
ok, but kids are dumb, drugs are common for both recreation and ill-advised self-medication
By them just not taking drugs
I feel like this could have been prevented
Cuz like, if it's that potent, that's not something you take to get high.
The article makes me really confused about what happened, cuz it sounded like they didn't know what they were taking and it was laced in.
they're in my sister's grade
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/sammamish-officials-heartbroken-over-deaths-of-2-skyline-high-school-students-who-overdosed-on-fentanyl/%3famp=1
Clearly you had lower expectations than I did, but I guess that makes sense? It's still just really yike to think about though
Sooner or later someone's gonna bite it
Nah there were a bunch of people off doing drugs
I mean, the fact that it's Skyline is kinda jarring
It's only terrifying if you're considering taking an ass ton of drugs
Yeah it's crazy
Luke Beirira (?) Idk how to spell
Holy fuck, that's terrifying
Yeah they were in my sister's grade
Holy shit, what??
Not
You'd think they could just like
Man
I have no idea what their names are
Some dude in August
And the second?
Who was the first?
No
Did you guys hear about a second skyline kid overdosing a few days ago
that's def part of it
what like late night chats?
i really miss just being alone but like with all y'all
at the same time, fuck life
and i don't super have to do this homework right now. my roommates are waking up at 6 tomorrow anyways, so i could just do that with them
i'm not keen on walking outside in the dark right now
i forget which ones
one of the libraries
any 24 hour study spots at UW?
Sophomore friend: find a good place where you can just be alone
Me: sitting on the floor of my bathroom while literally everyone else sleeps
Goddamn trains
Being up this late knowing my roommates are gonna wake me up before 8 is weird
Thicc waves
My sound waves are looking real good
Working on a coding project to input sound notes and graph the frequencies
you needed the sleep
it's ok lmao
Sorry for disappearing last night <@258094439636008971> I fell asleep
That’s insanity
Per quarter???
It goes up to something stupid like 4k
Nope this is the smallest
Are there smaller meal plan options?
Oof
We do, but the prices have like a 25% markup over regular grocery stores
You guys have some sort of market grocery store right
No way am I gonna get a thousand dollars of campus food and groceries in one quarter
There needs to be like a Costco or some shit to spend my dining plan at
I’m gonna be so popular at the end of the year
Same, I had 860 food points for lunch and snacks alone and at this point I still have 700
I'm about to spend the remaining $800 on my account on tea and pocky at the end of the quarter
dude same
<@!503787499605458954>: "I feel bad about buying really expensive shit until I remember that I was forced into getting a meal plan with way more $$$ than I will ever need"
For shits like me
This is a fantastic business venture they're just passing up
Booo
cereal is always sweetened
Idk man
Or is the cereal sweetened?
Worth
Like, rip the rye pieces but like
Make Chex mix without the extra shit
Can I get like a box of Chex cereal and just like
he's got the good shit
damn
And yes I'm still feeling kinda loopy from Alan's tea
CHEEEEEXXXX MIIIIIIIX
The red one is aight
the french onion flavor is 👌
I just like them
at all
they're not
I get they're supposed to be healthier, but they don't seem that much better for you
Never saw the appeal
Sun chips are kinda eh imo
I think I've had like 3 or 4 bags now
I'm pretty partial to the sun chips from our vending machines
You know something's weird when pretzels are the least salty thing in a mix
Eating the last shit from The Great Vending Machine Haul of September 2019: Chex Mix
A normal ass person could probably do cocaine and lead a healthier ass life than me
I am the epitome of health right now
rip
And I wake up with their earlier alarms cuz might as fucking well at that point
They're Earth-shatteringly loud
Except my roommates haven't heard my alarms yet
Big ass mood
she gets to laugh at my lazy and disoriented ass instead
that way my increasingly-loud-and-obnoxious series of alarms every morning doesn't piss her off constantly
thank god lena usually wakes up before me tbh
lmao
They change me for the better and I hate it
I should send a picture of this shit to my roommates later so they see the night owl in me truly blossom
I can't use the money anywhere else really
But like
I just bought $8 of vending machine food
Truth
I feel bad about buying really expensive shit until I remember that I was forced into getting a meal plan with way more $$$ than I will ever need
And you really are
This is definitely more expensive than getting a family size bag of chips across the street, but at least it'll encourage moderation going forward. I can't live without this food.
lmao no you would've found it eventually
I'm a god
11/10 influence on me
Cindy, you're the best
you're welcome
I have learned about the vending machine in my dorm. Freshman fifteen is about to happen
Or save the food
So maybe I should stay up a few hours and do homework to use some of this energy
I accidentally made a meal out of this
lol
???
Lol
And I panicked cuz I thought I accidentally spent $1k at a vending machine
our machines are super glitchy
For a second, it didn't pick up my card when I swiped
Let's get it up to 1500 and call it a day
Those peanut butter cups were 220
I had a gyro and fries today, so ima assume that was around 1000 calories
M O R E  F O O D
N O
go back to your room
Why the fuck
Also, it's so fucking cold here
And the chocolate part is p solid
It's organic though
Should've gone with Reese's instead of this random off-brand shit
oof
The peanut butter is powdery
Ok, ngl, this is nasty
I had one meal today, so no regrets
Starting with the peanut butter cups cuz protein kinda not really
I'm just gonna eat snacks one at a time until I feel like I can sleep
This is my life now
that could've ended v badly
I tried to insert my card into the cash slot
both
I'm leaning towards both if it takes my meal plan points cuz there's no fucking way I'll ever finish it
Also, should I get something healthy or something unhealthy
That's so you
Wait I love that
Lmaooo
this was like at least 1 am
last week I was doing laundry in the middle of the night and a bunch of my friends found me fucking around on my laptop downstairs in front of the laundry room while they were going to the vending machines to get snacks
I'm not even kidding lol this is really ironic
I think I can use meal plan credit hell yeah
I'm that asshole
me
Some asshole is doing laundry at this hour wtf lol
woo
Holy shit I found one
And the bank is way too far
Until everything costs more than I have on me
If there's a vending machine, I'm gonna be so happy
At least the elevators are open
that'd be iconic
Watch me lose my keys and lock myself out
So I can actually do shit like this
yeah so you've said
They're morning people
Which, thank god
They're both at home right now. It's just me
No, it's just an obscure reference
by "the boys" do you mean your roommates are also awake?
I mean, it's something
lol
I'm gonna find a vending machine of shredded cheese I swear to god
Me and the boys at 3AM looking for BEANS
Will keep you updated on my 2:00 AM search for shit food
yeah there's a bunch in our commons area
That's smart
There might be on the first floor actually. Imma go check
got any vending machines in your building?
yeah but like snacks
We just installed the fridge
that's criminal
do you not have anything in your room????
I'm subsisting off of water
Our fridge is empty
Nowhere is fucking open
It's 2AM
WHERE
Ayyy
go get food
it's an ungodly hour, of course I am
I need food
But holy fucking shit
So idk if anyone is awake right now
Ok
When you visit home, you should send us a picture of yourself with it!!
Hey, congrats!!
Never mind it literally arrived today lmao
If it’s really gone I guess I’ll spend the $80 to get another one
I think my IB diploma is lost in the mail 😭
We out here
Hi
I sound like shit but like sure lemme put on a shirt and turn the lights on
Wanna video call?
I'm in Jane and Salina's room
how's life
I'm sorry
Awww
hello I can't sleep again
Hey, I'm just getting here, but I hope you feel better soon. Try your best to get someone to take a look. Hope it clears up.
Alright take care
I might as well just take a short trip
Healthcare is free
This is Canada
They do if you go early enough but I'm not getting up at 7 to fight people over it
They don’t have walk in appointments?
I don't think it's urgent enough to go to urgent care so rip
Alright student health is booked for the next like month lol I think I'm gonna try a clinic in the city tomorrow
Yeah please go to the doctor
If your energy levels feel like shit and not for emotional reasons then I think it’s worth checking out
like I feel like I did and maybe still do but I really have no idea
I don't have a thermometer lol
Fever is your immune system kicking into high gear
idk if I had a fever to begin with
idk if I still have a fever
The fact your fever broke but you’re still fucked is really not good
After a week you should only be left with the residual stuff like coughing
Yeah go to doctor
Generally you should get better from a cold in a week especially the fever part
ok
yikes
You should see a doctor then
Oh ok
uh like 3-4 days
And also how long has it been at it’s worst?
it's been a week
If it's been longer than 3 days and you have access to an on-campus doctor I'd say pay them a visit
/what are the symptoms
Do you still have a fever?
ack
Yes
should I??
no
I'm still not like Actually Dying but it kinda feels like it
Have you seen a doctor yet
I thought I was getting better, that was not the case
I'm gonna have to get stronger beams
damn
Oh no has it gotten worse?
hoes this is Not Good I might actually reach out to academic advising about how sick I am bc I'm literally like not functional rn
Although don't be too hard on yourself if you need a night like that here or there. It's healthy if anything.
Well, Cindy, I'm really glad you got some sleep.
I'm starting to feel better though so hopefully I don't relapse
Not really by choice though I was just dying
Lol I slept at 4 and woke up at 1:30
I'm having that moment of realization that "oh shoot, I need to sleep even earlier to not live with bags under my eyes again"
Slept at 2:15, woke up at 7:30
I should have said "You can probably catch up after a year or so of being a nurse"
I just realized my missed opportunity for a joke
Oh shit
You can probably catch up on shots after a year or so of being a nurse
whose dick have you been swallowing, noah
oki
man
<@520095106888630348> and <@340319804747415553> you guys got competition in nursing
Also can probably give the best shots
Lots of practice
Weird flex but I would guess I can swallow the most pills at once of anyone in this group
Try dry swallowing ~~dicks~~ sets of pills
Weak
wow dry swallowing pills w a sore throat hurts like a bitch
Ok, well, ima move to the other channel since I kinda started there. That way, this is open if you ever change your mind
yea i'm good
Just thought vomit for the sake of doing it
It's not really even like a rant
You sure?
you do your rant i'll be here
i don't even really know what it is
nope
Do you wanna talk about it?
Awww, I'm sorry
ok i'm too stressed out to sleep
G'night
Y E S  S L E E P
the room is starting to sway around me
yeah i really should
your friend who has a brother 13 years older and loves dogs and suffered through IB diploma who goes to UW and lives in my hall
Lmao get some sleep. You deserve it.
uh huh
We saw this opportunity and ran with it
That's my friend from Issaquah lmao
I have the inside scoop
I saw your name on your door you can't lie to me
jk it is weird to be here without all of you
I'm in Alder
I actually lied
bitch im gonna see you in 14 hours
K g'night. Miss you too
i highkey miss all of you lmao
goodnight loves
so im gonna try to sleep
i think they shut up though
no idea
It's just to prevent you from being roommates with someone if you're uncomfortable
Or any dorm
Not all the rooms in Elm have it
maybe the guys near jane weren't high then
did all of you choose that?
Apparently the drug-free thingy locked you out of Lander or something during the room selection battle royale
They somehow landed a room in Lander despite claiming a room *after* me
ramya might've told me about this
Adam Dong and Daniel Cheng. They're family friends of mine lmao.
Ah, the twins
huh
Adam and Daniel are in Lander as well, those sons of bitches
the gubl something twins are also in poplar
Alan and Kenneth are in Poplar
Ramya is in Lander
lmao
Thank you for reminding me of their names so that I don't have to do the awkward wave thingy when they start trying to talk to me
those are the only two i've seen so far
Riya and Manisha are in elm
no not in elm
I'm actually not entirely looking forward to that
Yike
In Elm specifically?
i ran into a lOT of skyline kids
a lot of the same people are here
And I think it started sinking in when I took the IB diploma out of the envelope
Ok, wildly enough, this feels like the first time I've ever like *really* had to close a chapter on my life
lol
knifedrawer murderer
no
*gasp*
Plot twist: you're the chainsaw murderer
well, I'm next to my knife drawer
stop lmao
Chainsaw murderer
well that creepy
what is going on
I have my window open all is calm
literally nothing is happening
the lights are flickering in my building
bruh
but hey you're still their kid
I feel bad for the fella
...maybe the fish is beyond saving
Rip fish
The moment the automatic feeder runs out of battery or food, that fish is toast
They're the ones who wanted fish, but they don't bother to clean the tank (and I can't do much since it's a two-person job with how our house is set up) and don't ever check on the tank
Honestly, I'm rather concerned for the goldfish
They struggle to take care of a goldfish
And my dad travels a lot for work
Also, they don't have the strongest relationship in general
maybe they'll get a dog
They're definitely gonna miss me, and I'm concerned about how they're gonna handle an empty nest
They've been raising at least one kid for 31 years now (32 if pregnancy counts)
is it that they're going to miss you?
what happened w your parents gene?
cute!!!!
S q u i r t l e
Also, I'm lowkey more worried about my parents than they are about me
Wholesome
bc of course
I brought my iron man
Cute
I use him to keep track of hair ties
He lives in my backpack
Awww
Thank Courtney for ruining my system
I brought one ditto faced umbreon
Aw cute
I have like ~15 turtles all named Turtle except for one, who's named Shellby
I call him mr. penguin
idk what you're talking about
i had a dolphin pillow pet named dolphiny
Man
I never add a Mr.
he's just "penguin"
That’s what you call him?!?
Wait
no
Yes
oh goodness is he named Mr. Penguin???
because I know Jess gave him a stuffed penguin
Mr. Penguin
huh ok i thought you were gene for a sec
oh
yes?
...noah?
I brought my penguin
other than that, whoever you pick is going to be a good pick
ooof
bring eliza
I'm bringing some, but I'm putting off picking cuz that shit hard
I'm packing right now, and I want to bring some stuffed animals, but it just makes me think of Toy Story 3
I should just chill
it's a thursday, there's no way my friends won't be back before midnight
Jkjk but like yeah was an L
The sites where I got my textbooks don’t care about your backwoods hick politics book
I can’t find it either
thanks for the offer though
it's probably hopeless, the book is weirdly obscure
ok it's been an hour of piracy deep-dive and I have yet to find it anywhere that doesn't want me to give them my credit card info
I’ll look in a bit
I'm not really sure where to look
it is this book
https://www.amazon.ca/Introduction-Politics-Canadian-Robert-Garner/dp/0199021732
if anyone has time and is willing to help with that
pirate it?
this is literally like a 5 min assignment so hopefully it'll be ok, I need a pic of one page of the book, but I am stressed!!
also, my friends in that class are downtown rn and Im not sure when they'll be back
I'm lowkey panicking bc I really need my poli textbook for an assignment due tomorrow but I bought it used online and it hasn't come in the mail yet
rip
#whoops
i got a flat tire the day before move in
L
I got bored and started dancing ironically on a slick tiled floor. I slipped, my foot hit a drawer behind, and I just barely caught myself before falling by virtue of being 18 and fairly lucky. But as that happened, I felt myself slip and die from dancing in an alternate reality the day before I moved into college, and that somehow feels like the most Gene way to go out
Take care of yourself and give it some time. I'm sorry it's like this right now.
I promise it's gonna be a lot better
Probably a lot of yelling between now and then tho
It's alright, Jane. You'll be away soon.
I want death
Aww I'm sorry
rip
And I'm not going to complain about my parents again but I just want people to know that I am angered and I am confused as to why my parents thought that I'd want to visit them
I am angery
this is false the kind I have at home are amazing and are basically candy
The best coughdrops always taste the worst
bruh these cherry cough drops I picked up earlier today are literally disgusting but they work so well
I kinda like the swipes because there's a lot of variety and you can get things from several stations
We get 800 which is $800
We can do that too, with our food points
with like 2-3 exceptions
works anywhere on campus any time
ah I do think my meal plan is significantly more flexible than yours then
I always go at like the latest time possible tho
We get breakfast swipes so it's convenient to eat breakfast
I typically eat for the first time at 2-3 pm
it's just a general rule of my life now
I never eat breakfast
On those days I go to breakfast very late to compensate
When I don't have lunch break I just skip
I've been like subsisting on those on days I don't have lunch breaks
I recently discovered that there's a little shop near the library that sells buns from a local asian bakery and my god
Usually they cycle through the same stuff so those don't appeal to me anymore
They were all new varieties
Yes they are good
was it good at least
oof
Oops
I ate three pieces of pie
-insert leftist classism rant here-
this is america's problem
why is being fat so cheap
being healthy is expensive
yeah rip
the universal caveat
but money
I wouldn't call it unhealthy per se, and if you're going for weight gain I'd say potentially beneficial if you trained hard enough
this is what I mean when I say I don't think I have a very healthy relationship to food
you're like what I aspire to in terms of loving food but not thinking about it all the time
lol
dude I'd be so down
can we swap appetites
I can tell the difference between like psychological cravings and physiological hunger but I'm still tempted near-constantly
see if I ate whenever I had the urge to eat I'd literally be obese
hopefully at UW food options won't be a problem since I'm literally fifty feet from the ave
but now I'm waking up earlier and eating breakfast and stuff and eating whenever I even have the SMALLEST urge to eat
so my meals would be at 12 and 5 and not much else, at least for a little
doesn't help that my mom likes to have dinner at 5
(and I wonder why I was losing weight, go figure)
during the summer I would regularly eat two meals a day because I'd wake up too late to eat breakfast
there's nothing to eat back here in Sammamish
I have pretty much the opposite problem with food right now
but as I mentioned a lot of that had to do with cooking near-constantly
like don't get me wrong the food is delicious. i'm just usually much better at moderating stuff
and I know I'm not eating as well as I would be if I had more control over my food situation
the hardest part for me was finding exercises and form, so it's good that you have those resources available
I've been pretty active, I'm just still paranoid bc I constantly feel like I'm overeating
nice stuff
ALSO I FOUND A CLIMBING PARTNER I was so excited
taking a class and all that jazz, also got a friend helping me out
I'm just starting it
yeah
thought about weight training before?
my goal is still to gain weight, but to put on muscle and not fat
I've never needed to actually "lose weight"
However it's hard to do that here
I know the way that helps me lose weight is to eat three small meals a day
but I'm also broke as fuck
this is true
new point: eating more times a day means you get to try out more restaurants in the area
I pretty much know what works for me I just have less access to it now that I'm at school
Effects of OMAD are more ambiguous for women than men
thanks for the concern, it's very much appreciated but yeah
I'm aware of this
I had a whole phase where I did a deep dive into the sciencey side of nutrition
because nutritional/exercise/etc advice always depends on the person and the kind of lifestyle they live
but do watch your diet and how it affects you
okay well I take back what I said
(they called me in because I'm "Cambodian")
omad also stands for the office of minority affairs and diversity at uw
called OMAD or one meal a day
it's a more intense version of it
intermittent fasting, right?
there's a whole diet centered around the idea of eating one mega-meal a day with all your needed nutrients
bc it forces your body to fast/burn fat after a period of time
if you do it properly it can be really good for you
There's no significant difference in results between test subjects who did either
^
Overall it doesn't really matter
is it now?
this is actually very false
because eating one meal a day makes your body store a lot more fat and sugar from that meal than it otherwise would
even if you're not hungry, training yourself to eat after set durations of time is much healthier
you should really aim to have three or four smaller meals a day instead of one big one a day
with the risk of being a little naggy
I feel like I'm very rarely genuinely hungry
half the time I eat once a day
ok dude I've been doing something really similar
Fingers crossed 🤞
Duke has free nutrition services and I just met with someone today to help figure out a viable meal plan so I can eat more than once a day
Basically to compensate I've been eating only dinner and an apple in the daytime for the past week
Sometimes they have green beans that are pretty good
The only good vegetables are the raw salad leaves
The food is starting to get repetitive tho so thankfully the appeal in getting second helpings is going away
For breakfast and dinner I get swipes into an all you can eat place and that was a big problem a few weeks ago
<@503787499605458954> I definitely relate on the college meal plan thing lol
I saw this convo end at 5 am and I was like O.O
i'm sorry, salina :/
but also lmao explanations for being a shitty person aren't excuses
tbf also complicated
... welcome to my family?
are your parents spending their last days with you yelling at you??
i am getting my ass handed to me by my mom too lol
man speaking of getting reamed
g'night cindy. take care
big slep
slep well
goodnight cindy
night
love y'all night
gotta get that 7-8 hours
I'm actually gonna sleep soonish
ok well
rip
but like even in class my prof said that we'd need it so like
i hope so but i don't bank on it
lol
pray our profs are chill
i took a class with a textbook that was absolutely useless
esp between professors
i know
the lists are subject to change
i agree with cindy
^^^^
i'm a fucking pirate folks
<@!520095106888630348> not always accurate
but i don't know if you're taking the 180/200/220 sequence
i mean the textbook lists already have required or not required under the books
or just fail the class by not getting textbooks like me
i also have the bio textbook pirated
ooh
yeah
you usually won't need em for at least a week
only buy what profs actually say is Required. highly recommend waiting for them to talk about the syllabus/class plan first
actually, that's a valid point too jane
it'll cover me thru 3 quarters of chem
ooo neat
really? David said to get things ahead of time or secondhand books would run out
i found a like new copy on amazon for 25
i did buy the chem textbook
of course
and i will follow the saint's holy word
don't buy everything on the list
fair enough
that's what saint nicholas says
^
do it after class starts
eh
it was dumbassery
when do we need to get textbooks by again? when class starts?
i tried to get in too
suuuuuper big dumb
like big dumb
the verify system is DUMB
bc
why won't they let you in o.O
it's cheapest at uw, i checked
nurs 301 or whatever it is is access code only
i need to get textbooks but the damn UW TEXTBOOK EXCHANGE FACEBOOK GROUP WON"T LET ME IN
ok the tea is that my parents were super lenient with my sister and it's a combination of them feeling like they were too nice to her and me just being the least favorite child but now they're coming down super hard on me
jane we kinda have to buy from uw ._.
rip
(also, i need to get textbooks eventually lol)
what the hell did she expect
damn
sigh
yeah
and still she got mad?
I did buy used/rented everything else
don't buy from university book stories
and except for one $100 book that I needed like immediately
for future reference
I'm done now lol
http://slugbooks.com
did she like not know what they were?
yeah exactly
that's wack
but you need those?
wait what??
and I was like ??? this was not my choice lol
???
tl;dr I spent a lot of money on textbooks and she reamed me out for it
but now i'm broke and my mom already thinks I have a spending problem for dumbass reasons
oh, yike
I should've gotten one
hard bc I don't have my own fridge
meal prep?
ah adulthood
yesish, like I could make time, it's a lot more annoying to get groceries and stuff
do you have time to cook?
that fear is definitely valid. it's a lot of blind trust in a stranger
the one thing I have stuck to, and for some reason can maintain self-discipline on, is intermittent fasting
I also have a fear of being anorexic lol so it's not like I restrict my calories. but I usually track macros n stuff. and I love cooking and put a lot of effort into making food that's both good and good for me. kinda makes me anxious that I don't really know what's in whatever I'm eating
to clarify, we all by definition by food even beyond the biological need for it. it literally changes our brain chemistry (sweet hit of dopamine). it just problematic when it doesn't align with what's biologically good for someone
it's just a lot harder here, and has led to some erratic eating behaviors
idk like. I love food and I don't wanna stop enjoying food. I manage this at home by cooking for myself constantly and tracking what goes into my body
never considered that
I think most obese people have a food addiction
that's really interesting to think about
oh for sure
Huh. I will say that most eating disorders aren't classified yet and the classified ones may not even be the most common ones
lol
it's really not
that doesn't sound healthy in itself
I feel like it's mostly kept at bay by extreme fear of gaining fat
do you wanna talk about it?
uh
oh, that's different
not just "we all need to eat"
it's a legitimate eating disorder
no like
we all kinda do
i mean
sometimes I think I have a borderline food addiction
that is a pretty nice way to think about it though
like I'll choose not to eat pizza rolls for breakfast while thinking like "Future Me is going to feel so much better and less greasy if you don't do that"
yes but  i n s t a n t  g r a t i f i c a t i o n
i saw it on tumblr a few weeks ago but it helps me at least
if you think of eating healthy as a favor to your future self
and I was like yes but it's not like that was optional smh
ooferoni
@me eating a family size bag of chips in two sittings a couple days ago
where she was like stop spending money we're paying for you to have a meal plan
also also, my mom got kinda pissed when she saw me getting groceries off campus
significantly harder here
at home I just avoid buying things, like I make sure that if I want sweets n shit I have to Go Get Them
hopefully it works out though
oof, i feel that. i guess it is an uphill battle
so it's a constant battle for self-control lmao
and there's junk food everywhere and some of it is fuckin delicious i.e. the cinnamon rolls are divine
but also, I have basically unlimited $$$ to spend on food (it's way more money than I could ever actually use)
yeah, thankfully
can you get any groceries with your meal plan?
that's kinda an L
oof, i'm sorry
or fruit, unless I really try
I don't feel like I'm getting enough vegetables just in general
veggies get drenched in canola oil, etc
like they sacrifice health for taste and cheapness
it's basically like eating out constantly
some options are healthier than others, but despite health claims, I can tell that I'm not eating nearly as well as before
oh yike. that's a fair point
yes but that would require me to bring things back to our room i.e. getting containers instead of just using the bowls n shit there
do you guys have a fridge?
ok for one food here is generally pretty good, but I have almost 0 control over portion size, and I despise wasting food
lemme gather my thoughts bc I have a lot of them
i'm not surprised, but i'm curious
in what way?
I feel like being forced to have a meal plan has highkey worsened my relationship with food
happens to all of us
these are the thing i hate about myself
i have a sudden craving for fast food at 1:30 AM
i haven't known about his existence for even 10 minutes yet, but i already love him too ngl
everyone loves him, etc etc
nickname: pb
who's into skin care
the gay one
is it the hot guy?
probably not, just a good friend here, I think I've mentioned him a few times in this server
should I know?
who exactly are you talking about?
anyways I'm in a rambly mood I feel like I should be doing something but the procrastination is coming back full force
I just told him I'm sick he's the cutest person ever omg
c'est un grand L
lmao
Fuckin quebecoise
I'm surrounded by french speakers
Also <@520095106888630348> ooof. Those aren't fun. Dream analysis time?
Yiiiike I'm sorry, Helen. Take it easy and feel better soon.
😂
GOOOOOOO
BEAM
BETTER
GET
damn, breaking a bone from coughing
yikes. Im sorry
probably a few weeks
how long before you can use the gym again?
i'm mostly sad about not being able to use the gym
except the rib bone, that takes weeks
yeah generally i'm doing a lot better
are you ok??
0.0
i broke my rib bone last week from coughing
i had my first nightmare about high school since leaving 😄
welp
get some rest and drink honey lemon tea, feel better soon
i hope you feel better soon
awww, i'm sorry, cindy. get some rest and take it easy on yourself.
jane your writing/calligraphy/idk what to call it is gorgeous as always
it's funny bc I would constantly hope for this in hs bc it meant I got to skip school but now I just gotta suffer through it
probably getting there soon though, kinda surprised it took this long considering that Lena and like half my other friends are also sick
I'm in that limbo state where my throat is more itchy than sore and I have a headache and needed a nap at 8 pm but I'm not Legitimately Sick yet
hope you feel better soon
alright i'll try
if you think you have early carpal tunnel, give your wrists as much of a rest as possible and stretch them occasionally. reducing your use of them can sometimes do a lot. ask a doctor if it's still there or you have lingering concerns.
it's nice tho
has little compartments and charging ports for usb and outlet
it's like ten bucks at target
The lamp that you are using to write seems alright too
Very pleasing to the eye
Ah the word lamp is written very well
hm?
That is a quality lamp
Yesterday my arm was numb from my elbow down and today my grip is just weak and it makes me sloppy
I think I'm getting carpal tunnel or something
Don't feel bad. Get sleep when you can, especially since it's still summer for UW folks.
yike
I woke up at 12 and gave already taken two naps today
i woke up today at 12 and i'm already nodding off
this is no good
hello
tea
Making tea in my dorm has improved my life by 50%
And get a flu shot!
Make sure to stock up on medicine stuff
I've been coughing since
Two weeks ago I got a 103 degree fever but it went away in 12 hours
Get better soon!
Been there, done that, not fun, sorry to hear it and hope you feel better soon
Awww Cindy :(
Get betterrrrrr
Beam lol
GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
BEAM
BETTER
GET
nooooo
I'm getting sick
I jinxed it
fml
Reddit seems to have both an endless stream of content and so little content at the same time
In other news 13" performance tires are hard to find
It's late and I'm just wondering how I got here
ah
avinash
also who is avi?
Rip
`he doesn't like to be touched`
that is correct
I'm very touchy about my personal space
Yes your Gabe
avi?
also my Gabe?
The “my kid is such a miracle” parents are just really a sight to behold
Yeah it’s depressing
that's unfortunate :/
Rip kiddo
welp
oooooooooof
Sigh
And when her parents came to pick her up you could like really see they were trying to see past a lot of the common autism behaviors and making excuses for why she does things a certain way
I talked to my mom about it and she was like yeah I was thinking the same thing but her parents are in total denial of it and it’s really not my place to push the issue
aww
So there’s this little girl in the class who is like p sweet but I’m like 90% sure she’s autistic
what happened?
I had a p good day today but I have a smol sadboi moment of it
but I'll shut up about that now
Yeah
the most depressing thing is that I think most of the board would actually be good with different leadership
Rip rip
that was my sadboi moment for the night
but yeah
Lol
also he's dating you
he's said before that he likes his personal space
That’s fair
ok well aside from occasional hugs I'm not super touchy-feely with him and I think he prefers it that way
Rip I guess
Just all the hugs
He’s adorable with his family
lol
except by you
Waitttt
Wait
that's it
he doesn't like to be touched
Rip noah???
People are bad at life
possible exception of noah
But
Ik
and also, I'm like that with basically all my male friends
L
everyone else already Knew
bro literally shreya was the only person who kept pushing that
I was cringing so hard
Yikes the board roast
Kinda coupley but not really a couple pair of CPs
😉
And also the uh
FTFY
rip jsa
Dictator CP
at least I'll be remembered as The Decent CP
oh well
Lmao
Keyword
But he doesn’t
problem is he's rarely motivated
Yeah
the thing that pisses me off about hayden is that he's actually Hella Good At Things when he bothers to try
He’s good at talking to people but I don’t trust his ability to stick to a schedule sorry not sorry
Also I’m sorry but I think Hayden would be a trash DoP
She seemed p sweet
I just feel bad for her
I’m not judging that hard but also I’m cringing a lil bit
In a bathroom no less yeesh
10th grade is still like p young for doing it
Wow
Just
Me too
I have literally 0 clue how they're still together lmao
What is *happening*
Sigh
yeah it's kinda nast
Whyyyy
WHY
YIKEROO
YIKE
I question the judgment
yes
Bc um
“Let’s fuck in a public bathroom”???
Hooked up as in like
Well at least Diane is holding issy together
And avi for that matter yikes
being eli
What is Eli doing
Uhhhh
Autoincorrect can go fuck itself
Aw poor sana
Damn
-attendance was half of what we got last year
-sana wants to quit dop bc they don't fuckin respect her
-parth wants to replace her with hayden miller (no apps just nepotism)
-speakers were dead except jake and gabe (go gabe)
-eli hooked up with his 2-3 year younger gf in the bathroom at cabcon
-avi is constantly high
-basically everything is a mess, but issaquah is doing great at least bc diane's a queen
Hit me with it?
Oof
I'm getting a fuckload of tea
today was first meeting
i'm chatting w abhay and sana
What happened
Rip
there goes the fuck ton of work I put in to make us the strongest school in the state lol
highkey, skyline jsa is going up in flames under the new leadership and I knew it would happen but I'm still bitter
Happy Friday the 13th
lol you're fine
That's not supposed to sound sarcastic whoops
I honestly couldn't be happier for you
Cindy, that is so awesome
even when I'm up till 3 I get like 6-7 hours at a minimum
I AM SO PROUD OF YOU!!
I'm good
dude I just slept for 10 hours lol
You're doing great, Cindy
Just be sure to take care of yourself and get sleep, ya know?
Good luck
I'll live lol
Awww I'm sorry
is the unfortunate part
it's a lot of Work
Well, I'm glad it's at least easy for you
Ah, I get that
but I'm required to take it and the prof is cool so whatever I'll take the easy grade
I was just good at it
which personally, I didn't particularly enjoy
global arts studies feels like ib english part 2
I'm taking one moderately disinteresting class this year
I'm taking one moderately interesting class this quarter, and it's only a 3-credit class
I hate mine, and I haven't even started yet
I sleep like the dead tues/thurs and then do shit during the weekends
I love my schedule
lol
Well, that was really affirming
I just got out of bed
Yes
Is it worth getting out of bed at this point
Hopefully you can get some rest soon though
Luckily I had left that morning, to come back home
each of which are 20 floors
alarm went off for both buildings in orchard commons
We had someone burn a burrito and set off the alarm for our building, all 13 floors if it
doesn't seem to be anything actually wrong
yeah we're chillin
Are you alright at least?
HOES
but still
I don't have class till 3:30
I'm lucky
Aww, I'm sorry
if it was someone smoking or some bullshit I will track them down
who did this
I'm so annoyed
BY THE FIRE ALARM GOING OFF AT 1:30
from my bed
I was just rousted
I don't know
wtf is happening on my end then
is it you?
Shit
/tts who's using tts
idk what's happening but why is what everyone says being read out loud
uh
you're gonna kill it
aw
i got acttually rekt by nerves
and also get to studying for my practical exam retake
need to be nice and perky for hospital orientation stuff
i gotta sleep by like 12:30 at latest
Nvm, I'm gonna assume you get it and chose not to acknowledge it
I mean
Jane
i was listening to it meow and running around trying to find it and i didn't realize it was on the PENIS BUILDING
Jane, if I make the joke, it's less funny
<@!340319804747415553> what do you want to do?
make it
There is a joke to be made here
wouldn't come down until cole built a staircase for it
a cat spawned on one of the balls of your massive dirt dick
No?
I vote for all three at once
oh wait gene did you see what i said in the other server
we can watch hulu, we can play cards against humanity, we can talk about averagely attractive men again
What do you have in mind?
Am eating chips but sure
do what
Just got home
Hi
i'm like hella bored
is there anyone still up who wants to do things w me
thanks I'll go soap shopping tomorrow
omg you're a saint
this set is 28 bucks
https://www.ebay.com/itm/Dove-Botanical-Selection-Damage-protection-Shampoo-500g-Conditioner-500g-Set/253558546374?hash=item3b09445fc6:g:HNIAAOSwrsha0EKI
i know if you look around on ebay enough, they offer you a $5 coupon
gl dude

http://www.webichi.com/en/details/17102
okay now I might unironically spend 20 bucks on Japanese shampoo
oooooooh
it's not 30 dollars here
wait
https://www.ebay.com/p/Dove-Botanical-Selection-Damage-Protection-Shampoo-500g-Japan/27015231639
when my sister visits japan i'll even ask her to bring you some
we support you
well
I'm really about to spend 30 bucks on Japanese shampoo huh
AAAAAHHHHHHHHH
SHE SAYS SHE LIKES IT MORE THAN MY OLD SHAMPOO
MY MOM EVEN AGREES
don't be, it's my fault for mindlessly wandering into the promised land of Asia exclusive beauty products without knowing the dangers
alan i'm sorry for your loss
this feels so genuine but also overdramatic at the same time
WHYYYY
I'LL HAVE TO GO BACK TO REGULAR AMERICAN SHAMPOO SOON
BUT ALL I HAVE LEFT IS MY SMALL HALF EMPTY TRAVEL BOTTLE
IT'S SO GOOD AND I WANT MORE
Imagine having the sweet scent of a Japanese botanical garden in your hair at all times
It's like, botanical oil infused shampoo
$5
I spent 500 yen for the same size at some random drug store in Tokyo
how expensive is it normally?
$30 is the problem
I don't see the problem?
you can buy it on amazon
BUT SERIOUSLY
uh, ignore the green tea
https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41LgY4Vd93L._AC_SL1500_.jpg
send photo of the shampoo
IT WAS SO NICE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I WAS GENUINELY EXCITED OVER A HAIR CARE PRODUCT
The Dove shampoo I bought in Japan is a Japan exclusive item and I'm SO SAD
L
maybe the 4 pm coffee was indeed a mistake
I have a massive headache and really want to nap but haven't been able to fall asleep for the past hour
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S5-ipUbHvs
for more the crazy-athletic side of fs - see nathan chen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bNOnXTe4Ok
have some pairs skating
since I realized this is the only fs discipline I haven't dropped a video for yet
spins and jumps are some of the best examples of the laws of momentum lol
yeah!! I did a physics project on figure skating in junior year
also slip angles apply to ice skating as well
I love nerding out about two completely different topics with jane between us lmao
interesting
oh huh
<@!503787499605458954> back to ice skating
anyway
they are incredibly complicated and the science behind them often referend to as "black magic"
for modern cars tires are the limiting factor, in accelerating, braking, and cornering
i can go with that
alright
I actually feel like your explanation is easier to understand though
yes basically
I feel like that's more confusing lol
basically traction gets determined by the angle between where the tire is pointing and the direction it's actually moving?
uhh idk how to explain it in clearer terms than you already did tbh
yeah
oh
lemme find what you were saying earlier lol
hang on
I'm ngl I did not pay attention to the first part
<@!503787499605458954> make any sense then?
I never took physics
maybe?
that make any sense <@!520095106888630348>?
so you want to make sure the angle it is at is optimal to get the maximum traction
the angle it is slipping at determines how much grip it can provide
basically the tire has to be slipping to produce grip
slip angle is much more complicated
so basically the spring rate tells you how spingy the tire is at different pressures
granted I also did ib
ok so I'm not crazy
yee
skyline physics went over it
<@!503787499605458954> you do right?
I assumed you would
oh
should i
no
do you know hooke's law?
<@!503787499605458954> she's so tiny omg
and noah sorry i still have no idea what that is
and this is slip angle based on psi and camber
so this is spring rates based on psi and camber
alright back at my desktop
some of the falls are so smooth though it's crazy
my favorite is when he falls and just sits there and pounds his fists and feet

except cheer leading, i can't do it but i watch and am terrified
dancers, figure skaters, martial arts, what have you
i love watching people do cool stuff that i can't
oh sure
I can spam you with videos if you want lmao
I put myself into a massive figure skating rabbit hole, in case you didn't notice
lmao
i tihnk i'll pass on that one
learn everything about the shrek cinematic universe
you should binge watch all the shrek movies
i'm not gonna watch it
the first one
which one?
lmaooo
shrek's on hulu
oh my gosh
i dunno, whatever's on hulu
do you have anything to do to keep you entertained at least?
awww, i'm sorry
now i'm gonna be up for another 6 hours
i've been trying to exhaust myself into sleeping early
I get cole to wake me up before his 8 am classes and i went hiking but then i konk out early like today. Fell asleep at like 6 and woke up two hours later
also, i lowkey wanna make a trip back into skyline to see some teachers and seniors, but i obviously can't go during school hours and am just kinda too scared to go in general lmao
the ib conditioning is real
i don't want to sleep, but i want to wake up at a normal hour to be functional
I really don't want to sleep
me: maybe i should sleep
ib-conditioned brain: no, you can't. you have so many important things to do
me: you're right. i need to watch spongebob right this instant.
brain: that's not wha--well... i mean, i guess you're right, huh
Yike. Not yikes. Singular. Yike.
yikes
yikes, tok flashbacks
That's just a general thing i thought
No no
am I dumb
I don't see "Ethics" anywhere Jarrett
maybe Environmental Services and Plant Operations??
uhhhhhh
Ethics and the other one right?
bc i am a confuse
is anyone seeing any committee name thing in here
You're fine, Salina. It'll click soon enough. Don't be too hard on yourself
*SAT flashbacks ensue*
i've been stuck on one question for like 5 mins
i think im bad at reading now
guys
Eye for an eye
Aha but they get suspended and injured too
Instead of just losing today, get all of your best players injured and suspended so you can't win for the next week's worth of games
Yes, that's a brilliant move
Cant you start a massive fight and end the game early?
It's a rip
damn ok
There's no mercy rule in the vast majority of professional sports
Well better one than none
there's no mercy rule in baseball?
??
21-1
The Mariners losing 21-1 today is a phat mood
My dream is prophetic
Lmao sure
one of these days we'll find you one
gene
I kinda wish the dress had actually somewhat fit, ngl
i might've heard about this
<@173668455856340994> Jiayi was filming, so I'd imagine he'd have it
It was also incredibly undersized
I can probably ask Cindy for it if you wanna see it Jane
It was for a project in sophomore honors block
Yeah
there's a photo of you in a dress?
Only part I remember was that at the end, I was with you guys, and y'all were upset that you had to delete that photo you guys have of me in a dress (or maybe just Jiayi has it, but for some reason, everyone did here), and I was like "guys, chill, as I've said before, I'll do it again if we find the right dress, so y'all can just take another picture"
Had a second dream in there that I mostly forgot.
Details are kinda fuzzy, but I had a Slenderman-esque horror dream, but all my friends and family didn't believe me when I said I was seeing scary shit. At the end, I found out literally everyone but my mom was a zombie thing in disguise and then they killed her. Was not a fun dream.
Weird dreams last night
self roast
woooow roasted
take that w a grain of salt
i'm dating noah
then again
huh they're p good looking
i just vaguely look at people and am like
i don't have a physical ideal for ppl
*idk*
who do you think is an averagely attractive man
ah
AN AVERAGE MAN IS HARD TO FIND
AVERAGE LOOKING PEOPLE ARE HARD TO FIND
no idea what is happening anymore lol
i have
and yeah I know but we're trying to rate purely by physical looks
I've read about the plane seat thing before
anyway that's my take on it
I think you get the point
etc
or an great face, an average body, and an ok personality
it's more likely they have an average face, an ok body, and a great personality
basically the point is, the average person likely doesn't have an average face, and average body, and an average personality
https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2016/01/16/when-us-air-force-discovered-the-flaw-of-averages.html
out of the 4000 soldiers they had measured to get their average seat, exactly zero had all the average measurements they had calculated
to their dismay, basically no one worked well in the seats
so they took measurements of a large group of soldiers then averaged all their measurements
the airforce at one point tried to design the perfect seat for fighter jets
so to give an example of why it's hard
or to pick someone I know who is "average"
yeah
to define an average looking person?
wait what is so hard
i don't know
Cole and I debated it for like an hour
why is this so difficult lmao
I've been thinking about this for the past 10 mins
fair enough
If I had their permission, it'd be different
at the moment?
and yea personality is the most attractive thing but we're just using photos so we can't take it into account
It doesn't feel like it's in good taste to call someone I know average without their permission at the moment. Also, I'd be biased based on their personality.
Then no shit their bodies are better than their faces
but like you interact with normal people right?
I have trouble telling you who's average because most people I can reference are famous people, who tend to be above average
they're all american ninja warrior competitors
I considered both, but I gotta keep y'all on your toes
Wait is this guy an American Ninja warrior competitor?
wasn't sure
i thought it might be Tom Holland, then I thought it might've been a selfie
-.-
The picture I was gonna send was Edgy Tobey Maguire
Just to clarify cuz I gave up
He doesn't look average, but he is indeed average
no i genuinely want to know who you guys think are averagely attractive
oh I thought it was a gen question
cole and i settled on this guy
Otherwise, I would
Because we're referencing pictures
I would say no
yes
Are we taking personality and other into account? Like if someone had a super weird voice would they be less attractive
Thanks, guys. Y'all are the best.
Lol
lol
wait no i meant to up Cindy's statement
don't let anyone tell you otherwise, esp yourself
^
Like, maybe I'm sliiiiightly above average, but I'm a fair reference for the average
you are above avg cute
Me
I'm gonna go back to my top 10 list while I wait lol
who is just an averagely attractive male specimen
discord sucks
I'm upset
Discord is taking forever to send the file rip
tom holland?
But nothing compared to the peak embodiment of male attractiveness:
Mild stoner vibes but still attractive
here's a normal shirt gene
LMAO
Lmao his face
to be fair i can't blame cole for this one because the first photo i pulled up of this guy was this
Above average, but I'm not entirely comfortable with that. Maybe if he wore a fucking normal shirt, I'd be more confident in that statement.
would still rate as a bit above avg
body is better than face
cant find a normal photo of the guy but is this an averagely attractive man
Weasels are hot tho don't @ me
COLE THINKS HE LOOKS LIKE A WEASEL
I would rate a bit above avg
Above average
yes
Averagely?
Go for it
would you consider this an averagely attractive man
I'm listening
technically two things
well
to settle a dispute i had with cole
Sure thing
oh can i ask you guys something real quick
I'm sure he's done the same before
Ripperoni
for one second i was like "When's Ray's birthday?" and then i felt real stupid
I'm sure he will make whatever place he goes even better
well i'm sure he'll go somewhere good
ah alright
I didn't ask
Idk tbh
does he want to go there or is he just applying because he's moderately interested?
That said, I'm really glad he's applying to UW
fair enough
I think ima probably run back to Skyline to see some teachers, so maybe I'll try to flag him down
He never responded rip
And idk
Because I will leave once I perish in the ritual
No, no, I left
wait speaking of ray are we gonna see him
U RIGHT
Hell, so is Ray
Shannon's still under 18
They shall REIGN
No, no
REINS
alright where are third graders that can take the reigns from me
A small price to pay for salvation
One could say that it's
Sacrifices must be made for journey to come to a end
You'll just have to perish in your own ritual
Your dream can still be accomplished
but we're all over 18
For you were the visionary, our prophet, and the world's savior
Applaud yourself
i applaud you
that was better than the dream itself
I will accept no counterarguments.
Your hatred of older generations was burning strong within you. It was so strong, you were prepared to take drastic action and start a revolution headed by third graders. In this dream, you summon the power of Satan via Digimon and perform your ritual in a circular formation, ending "the days of the phoenix." Now, this might seen like some cryptic bullshit, but it represents the ideal society your visionary self was imagining: one where the old, those who have risen out of bed and gone through the most life, thus being represented by a phoenix, are dead and cease to exist. This means that by the time anyone reaches adulthood, they are sacrificed to Satan as a means of maintaining your society. The pyramid suggests your search for using old ideas that the older generations had long cast aside as foolish. In other words, you were dreaming of creating a communist society run entirely by children by killing everyone over the age of 18 via violent satanic ritual.
Anyways
That came off harsher than I meant it
Sorry mb
okay okay sorry
Ok, so anyways
Shit look, ok, I'm only half conscious
this is not the kid from home alone wtf
The meme
"The future is now, old man"
yeah
You know that one quote?
So you've seen Home Alone, right?
so a good while ago
Perfect
I need this context for dream analysis
i was in elementary school
So how long ago was this?
Not for me in dreams at least
is that not normal?
Also, how the hell do you remember specific things people said lol
I mean, DIGIMON??
This is some satanic shit
And ima say this straight up
Ok, some I'm only a couple lines in
me and a bunch of kids were standing in a circle around a big red pyramid and everyone had a digimon with them and in rows behind the circle of kids were a bunch of elderly people and grandparents of the kids. There was like a buzzer sound and then all the kids started closing in on the pyramid. There was an explosion behind me and then I looked back and the metal chairs that the elderly people were sitting on were flying through the air with the smoke and blood and dismembered limbs of all the elderly people that had been watching. There was a force field around the pyramid that protected all the kids and digimon from the explosion and none of the debris from the explosion reached us. The kids continued looking around the outside of the pyramid. I ran around until I found a red phoenix-ostrich thing running around in the sand. I grabbed the ostrich's tail feathers and as I prepared to yank there was a voice in my head that really dramatically said "The days of the phoenix. Are. Over!" and then I pulled all the feathers out in one pull and immediately woke up
I'm already slightly delirious anyways
I'll work with what I get
Don't worry
i don't know how much detail you need to visualize it how i saw it
give me a minute to type it out
Oh?
there's one from when i was younger that was kinda weird
Although idk how they could get MORE confusing
That's fair enough. I don't blame you
lmao these are the ones that i'm comfortable sharing
there are others that are more confusing and others have more obvious meaning
But sure.
These dreams are kinda wild. I don't even know where to start lol.
Honestly
do you want to try your hand at interpreting my dreams
i dunno
well she looked p alive
So I don't blame you
Dead
Uh
She was kinda
Eh, I mean
i'm having trouble placing her face
or some other tv show
she might've been inspired from someone on american ninja warrior lmao
Dear god
huh
soccer mom zombie yes
And even through death
Even in rain
Soccer mom zombie
so like a soccer mom but with her arms out and pursuing this defenseless bird
it was a zombie but it was a she and she had a blonde ponytail and blue eyes and was in athletic wear
Pretty female zombie? That's oddly specific
it was my brother David
`I was next to a bird in Minecraft being chased by a pretty female zombie with no food or sword. The bird ran around in the forest a bit before he went down to a room and he locked himself in a floor to ceiling cage in a cave so the zombie couldn't get to him. Ben and Leslie from Parks and Rec, and David came down, subdued to zombie. The bird flew out of the cage and ran away. The zombie told Ben that killing her would ruin his relationship with Leslie. Ben kills her anyway`
I peeked at a few episodes when my brother was watching it back when I was like 12
A little bit?
do you know anything about parks and rec
One of these days
Ripperoni
i am always DISMAYED
The ol' buy one get one free
like i'll go back to sleep after a really good dream and then have a different dream and forget the old one that was so good
NO and I ALWAYS WANT TO
There's a degree of control, but it doesn't feel as much like a dream
You ever do that?
The closest I've done is resume a dream to "finish the story"
Never have. The moment I realize, I wake up.
do you lucid dream?
i had them a lot when i was a kid. Now when I'm aware i'm dreaming and try to change something I end up waking myself up
Have you ever had a lucid dream?
That's so amazing
Mr. Leonard lmao
If I had your dreams, I'd love it too
i had an eragon-themed dream where a dragon hatched for me and we were trying to overthrow the government
and then they caught me and chained the dragon under a waterfall so it got too cold to move and turned into stone and then Mr. Leonard and Ms. Kulz (my sophomore year spanish teacher) tortured me for information
Yeah lol
do you see why i love dreaming so much now lmao
Damn, though. That was a ride.
Very vaguely Minecraft themed
That was
`i was inspecting portals with some people and then i was gping around taming animals by fighting them and then putting them in my barn. I pokemon go fought and tamed a unicorn with my cat but this one cat didn't want to stay where i put her so i took her somewhere else and then a French woman walked in and she was like "Is the owner here?" and i was like "I have no idea who that is, is she going to come and take my barn away from me?" but i said "she's not here at the moment" and then the woman was like oh ok and started to leave before she went "there's a giant man walking around outside" so we were afraid and stayed in the barn until the sun came up`
oh here's one of the minecraft ones
maybe i sleep more deeply?
I wonder why
Yeah sounds like it
i have p vivid dreams
I have never had specific dates appear in a dream. That's kinda wack lol
What the hell lol
`i went to like Japantown in the UW campus and i went to the pokemon store and there were half naked girls dancing around on the upper levels and there was an older woman who helped me with a run-in with some security guards and i had a sneaking suspicion about the old woman so i found her house a few days later. she went to sleep but i saw on her lawn a giant memorial and it was her grave; the date for her death was november 8, 2019 and she had a talking mannequin with my name on it and it told me about how she was my long lost grandma and then she walked out of the house. I was like "did you not die??" and she went "no it's September"`
Lmao
and i'm reading through my dreams and my goodness i'm so funny
cole already has like 3 beds in a row at his place
exactly
Just gotta be smooth enough and set up a Minecraft bed next to Tom's while he's not looking
now you just gotta make the sandwich
you got the hunks
tom holland and cole
yeah
I was partway there in the dream if you think about it
may mean that you will achieve a hunk sandwich with tom holland at some point
``the me``
alternatively
that means orgy with the me, COle, you and Tom Holland
I don't remember the details, but like that was the premise of it
I was playing Minecraft with you and Cole, but we were also playing with Tom Holland
Wait that just made me remember one
i've had a lot that were vaguely minecraft themed recently
Sure thing!
here do you want to see one
i usually write down my dreams when i wake up
I just enjoy them a lot and like to remember them
no problem
Sorry, I'm drawing a blank
Uh
Geez there are very few dreams I remember for a few hours after they occur
i can interpret if you'd like
lemme get a crystal ball or something
do you mind sharing?
I don't ever really have super fucked up dreams, but I get scary ones p regularly
I don't mind the other nightmares as much but those are the ones that would mess me up for a good while
sorry
Why would you put those thoughts in my mind
like having sex with Donald Trump or your parents or something
Ok, that's fair
i feel like it's mostly just saying something about your mental state or how you're feeling
idk i like dreams. It's like watching a movie while I sleep. I'm kinda scared of having one of _those_ nightmares tho
The like horrifying wtf ones
They're kinda spotty though
Sometimes they can yeah
do you believe dreams have any larger significance though?
I feel like "first" memories are kinda arbitrary though. You need a bit more from someone's childhood before you can say something. Otherwise, you're just pulling a random memory with no significance aside from when it happened and extrapolating. At least with dreams, you're extrapolating based off of something related to someone's subconscious.
You're a god at interpretation dreams
Lmaooo truth
and yall know how good i am at interpreting dreams
i dont know
i always find it super interesting to know what people's first memories are
i feel like if i unpack it enough then it says something about the person. Like dream interpretation but childhood memory interpretation lmao
fair enough
It's both a dream AND my oldest memory. It's gonna be pretty foggy.
It's a hazy memory
They were punching shit.
what was the nightmare tho
Got a problem?
Yeah, that's what I said
a nightmare about the power rangers
It was a "nightmare" about the power rangers
I've mentioned this before
@here what are your first memories?
i don't know if i've asked you guys this before
oh im curious
does having your first course start at 11 all days of the week count towards that
complete anti-morning person huh
i was out by like 12:15, woke up 7:00
I went to bed at 6:30, so close to overlapping
I mean this non-sarcastically
good for you
._.
... i went on a run at 7:30 bc i'm antsy about not having to dish out breakfast to very sleepy residents
I'm just not willing to give up staying up late
I will concede that getting up early, when you've actually had enough sleep, is actually super nice
it's just conditioning
you've never been a complete anti-morning person like me
How did this happen
Help me
Clinical has turned me into a morning person
sleep well
night
G'night
Thanks for listening to my extraordinarily vague and meandering rants. Sorry if I seemed a bit delirious or was going off on tangents occasionally. However, I really appreciate y'all's support. You guys just being there and actually caring enough to care about me really means the world.
Y'all be sure to get some sleep eventually too because you guys are worth it.
Getting up before noon so the day isn't halfway over once I roll out of bed is actually one of the motivating things for me. Working at night makes me feel like I did something wrong (although I love being awake at night for fun, but I gotta cut myself off at some point).
I should probably sleep
(And if I'm not gonna hide my vanity, pride. I don't like it, but that's another thing I'm working on.)
Oddly enough, doing the work is motivating in itself. Kinda like runner's high I guess.
do you know what motivates you?
I don't plan to work in constant crunch.
Of course. Gotta stretch first.
don't force yourself into it. you do your best work when motivated
dip your toe back in
I'm sure I'll need to rest again eventually (as Noah said, but I don't think I'll go to the point of burning myself out on a monthly basis), but now's a good time to go for it.
Maybe a month or so back, sure. I'm kinda itching to find my swing again though. Sitting on my ass is starting feel uncomfortable.
I definitely don't feel fatigued anymore.
rest and recover a bit
maybe it's something you need to replenish
To put it in big brain talk:
I previously had too much motivation. Now, I have zero motivation. I gotta find a happy medium. Maybe something like eight motivation will better fit my needs.
I just, ya know, still gotta push myself a little bit.
I know better than to push myself beyond my limits after the past two years.
There is, but thankfully, I can adjust my expectations as I go. At the same time, if I want to find that boundary, I can't keep skating by on the bare minimum.
there's a fine line there between working hard and trying to do the impossible
I think IB might've thrown me for a loop. Prior to it, I'd set high expectations for myself and could put in high effort to match. IB is kinda proof I can't always put in however much effort to fit a need. But after committing myself to it, I was stuck with my situation and got accustomed to looking for the easy way out. I think I probably need to find a way to match my input with my output. That probably means both putting in more effort and adjusting my goals as I go.
I mean, it's less about comparing myself to others and more about being too self-absorbed about my own flaws to put them in perspective with other people's. I'm aware most people are a mess running around in an adult's body. I'm just so self-centered that it's somehow not ok when I have the same problems as anyone else. I don't compare to myself to other people and thus fail to cut myself the same slack everyone deserves.
well gene from the outside you look pretty good to me
everyone looks better on the outside because people want to appear as good as they can
you're not a terrible person, you just see your flaws more keenly than other people do because you're inside your own head
Granted, it's based of flawed reasoning. I know I'm definitely not the worst person I know. I'm just stuck staring at myself a lot.
Yeah, point still stands
and Cindy
I mean you know me
that's a bold statement
I'm my least favorite person in my life by a fairly large margin if that makes any sense
No, but it's a bit of a problem when the things someone dislikes about themselves heavily outweighs the things they like
is anyone ever perfectly happy with who they are?
I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm not entirely happy with myself. I'm kinda looking flip a switch or for everything to click at some point, but growth isn't exactly linear.
Yeah, I worded that pretty badly
idk man you seem pretty qualified to be Gene Wang, you meet all the requirements 

Requirements to be Gene Wang
-------------------------------------
-Am Gene Wang ✓
Mostly because I look at myself, and it's almost like I'm not qualified to be myself if that makes any sense.
Part of it is I want to develop better, more productive habits I guess.
And while projects are part of it, it's not the big picture in my situation. I personally feel like it's a state of mind, habit, and focus type of issue.
<@193229269076279298> I see what your saying. I personally have a bit of an obligation to keep moving by virtue of knowing my personality. I need continuity to focus on something and do my best work. Breaks tend to be discouraging for me if anything.
Thank you
you got this gene
there's no rush
stop when you feel it
if I feel like working on it for 4 weeks but push myself to do 5 weeks, I'll burn out of twice as long than if I just stopped when I wanted to at 4 weeks
just do it at a pace that you can enjoy
then don't feel pressured to rush it
nvm! then noah has good advice
There isn't
but in a month I'll probably have move on for now
I get the sense that there's some time constraint, or at least a perceived time constraint, on whatever gene's doing, so idk if that's gonna work
currently I'm working on it again
and slowly you make progress
but when I feel like it I work on it
who knows
maybe in 10
maybe next
maybe this year
but I have a commitment, I will finish this one day
I work on other things, play videogames, do school work, hang out with friends, etc
so I stop
I'll burn out and just not be feeling it
I'll maybe go at it for a month then "give up"
Yeah, I guess it is a matter of perspective when it comes down to it
also I give up on it a lot
but mentally I've made a lot
so practically I've made no progress
and all the reading I did is still (mostly) with me
all those failed attempts taught me something
what I have accomplished is a whole of reading and learning
however
I have lots of bad failed attempts at each but nothing that I actually plan to carry on and continue
I have no chassis, suspension, drivetrain, or aero work actually done
well in one respect nothing, in another a lot
what have I accomplished
so I've had this project to work on for a long time now
anyway
idk, idc
wait is that 2 years then?
at the beginning of Junior year
I started this project 3 years ago now
I'm trying to design and build a car
and jane's right that it's fine to have lazy days
well I'll just talk from personal examples then
idk if this really applies to your situation
but then if I separate it into small incremental things for each day i.e. "pick a language to learn" followed by "find online resources" etc at least it's some progress, and the tasks are small enough that there's no real excuse for me to keep putting them off
I'd rather not talk about it. Thank you for asking though.
<@!258094439636008971> is there something specific you want to do?
like it's easy to say "I wanna learn how to code" (an example from my life) and then never follow through bc that seems like A Lot
I guess my only real advice is to break all the grand goals into as many small steps as possible, and go about trying to implement the small steps. I think I might've mentioned this before but it's a strategy that almost always works on me
doing nothing is doing something too
you've been pedal to the metal for a long time, Gene. It's not a sin to have lazy days, and it's not even necessarily a bad thing. People need rest too, let yourself have those days without guilt, because you haven't done anything wrong. You still have some time to do work or whatever else you need to get done, don't worry so much
Idk, that doesn't sound healthy
maybe I should've, maybe it would've eventually guilted me into doing something useful lol
I didn't keep track
I'm v curious how many days I completely wasted this past summer
where you know what you technically want to do and what you're "supposed" to be doing to achieve those goals but don't actually do anything
I've been there
that's fine
I know I'm being vague, but I'd rather not be more specific.
It's kinda hard to be patient with myself, cuz I start wondering if being patient with myself is a flaw in itself.
There's a weird disconnect between the life I want to live and the shitbag I actually am.
This sounds kinda bad, but it's like I suck at what I know I'm supposed to be doing and how to live my life.
aww
It's nothing new or groundbreaking. I'm just irked with myself for not being productive/better at life and just ran into a string of mildly unfortunate situations today. More of hating myself than my life if that makes any sense.
do you wanna talk about it?
yikes
I'm drowsy-ish but too pissed at myself to be content with calling it quits
Idk
but if you've already started getting ready to sleep do that, don't worry bout anything
i'd say do that if you can't sleep
I would vote for doing something chill and calming first
can't worry about things while unconscious
np
Thanks, Noah
I'll go get ready for bed I guess then and sleep in a few
I mean, they'll still be there in the morning, but I guess chilling isn't solving that either
sleep washes problems away
sleep
I had a bit frustrating day. Should I do something chill to calm myself down or just give up and sleep?
Hey, so someone help me make a decision
did someone say jetlag
night!
G'night!!
"aight imma head out"
night loves talk to y'all later
aight I'm gonna go to bed
lol
It actually feels like 2:30 whereas normally I would be surprised that it's 2:30
Very, very slightly
I don't feel it at all unless it's like a 10 hour time difference
do you get jet lagged flying across the country?
Yeah, I'm still a little jet lagged lol
we should probably all sleep
I should also probably sleep sometime soon
Oof I'm sorry
why did I do this to myself lmao
after I mentioned it I went and listened to the requiem for a dream soundtrack and now I'm sad
Gene that sounds amazing i'm in
Wicked is amazing!! The book is a lot more graphic tho. Not more graphic than The Reader but that's not saying much
1. Will look into wicked! I know you've mentioned it a few times, so it's actually been in the back of my mind.
2. The power move is to play bard and derail the entire campaign by attempting to use shitty pick-up lines on everyone and everything you meet as the rest of the party attempts to shut you up because they know you can't seduce a dragon.
ayyy I saw wicked in nyc a few years back!! it was lit
depressing movie
and also i appreciate you talkinga bout two things
1. Recently saw the musical Wicked then read the book, and I really fuckin loved the book
2. It does sound fun
<@520095106888630348> what are you oofing?
I've heard of it but never got around to it
fuckin fantastic soundtrack, btw
it's about heroin addiction
requiem for a dream
there's a clear winner for me, unfortunately
ah
Probably that documentary they show us as sophomores during the WWII/Holocaust unit, ngl.
sure
Do documentaries count?
I have not watched many depressing movies despite knowing of a lot I should watch, but I have trouble getting into the right mindset.
oooooooof
what's the most depressing movie you've ever watched
<@520095106888630348> I'm trying to talk about two things at once so here's my best attempt
1. Just tell me what the book is. If you want to suggest it, I want to read it at some point in time. I've suggested shit to you before and you read/watched them. Only feels fair if I do the same. Besides, you have good taste.
2. You'd love D&D. You'd play a great bard (artsy musician who doesn't fight much, lot of social manipulation, stereotyped for attempting to flirt with everything) or a really hilarious druid (I haven't worked with one before, but it's effectively a shapeshifter per my understanding. I think that includes wolves, which are basically doggos, fight me)
people voted against it
we were going to watch that in IB psych
yea
p famous novel though
I think so??
is that also a movie??
next on my to-read: gone girl, which I somehow have not read yet
currently working on: chinese lessons and the nazi conscience
I just finished: the ice beneath her, the roses of may, and the case against impeaching trump
I got a few other things on my list in line before it, but I love suggestions
I have a p long list I'm working through already but I will read whatever it is within a few months
that means probably not
Maybe not immediately, but sure
maybe
do you have time
but like can i suggest a book for yall to read
At its core, it's basically sitting down and playing make believe (granted with some degree of structure and rules like any game) in a fantasy setting. You role-play a fantasy character, and the DM guides the group through an adventure of some sort.
Hmm how to explain it
i don't know what that game is about
when I'm around
I"m down
What we should really do is play D&D sometime lol
fair enough
both bravery and ambition are p important to me lol
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I consistently test as gryffindor but I also have a lot of slytherin so
first time i took the test it said i was a ravenclaw so i usually go with that
I am a Hufflepuff yeah
my house changes every time so i don't know
<@!503787499605458954> you're absolutely right and i will not argue
i suggest a book to you to read and you suggest a book to me and just read it
actually, gene's a hufflepuff I will entertain no argument
wait I have no idea if we've asked this before but. hp houses?
im p sure this is how i ended up reading the hobbit gene
I feel like I pitched this a while back before surgery and it never took off cuz I died inside
Wdym?
For me, Harry Potter is great escapism, but once I'm out of it, I'm out for a good while.
it's like a loose book club thing
oh can we do something
I used to do it with my brother but we don't do it anymore
That's fair enough. That might be it.
there's some good ones out there, they just tend to be much more dated, 'cause I mean HP's peak is long gone
soft disagree
I still enjoy it, mind you
that's sad
Which is why I'm not super into it
ehhhhhhhhh
harry potter doesn't have good memes
also
True, but some moreso than others
i feel like everything i get excited for isn't very good
I always kinda liked SpongeBob as a kid, but I revisited it and loved it more once I was shown how memeable it was
almost every community has good memes
Which is true more times than I'd like to admit
Honestly, for me, if a community has good memes, that's when I consider getting into it
even for series I care about a lot
it's also really rare for me to get That excited over movie/tv releases
even when realistically I know I'm gonna use those 2 hours to just fuck around online
idk like even though I know I'll enjoy whatever it is that's on my watchlist I tend to put it off bc 2+ hours just seems like A Lot
this happens like once a year though
<@!258094439636008971> we got a long list of things to watch then
also like the first half of got before I got bored
see: sherlock, seasons 1 & 2 of TGP, the whole-ass MCU last summer
<@520095106888630348> I'm down
VERY occasionally I'll get super into something and binge it
The exception being SpongeBob
I also feel like it says a lot about me as a person that I have a hard time committing to anything longer than like 15 mins
Ok, I don't watch a lot of TV, and I miss a fuck ton of references
we should just all watch LOTR
Really, I just wanna play more D&D. My character accidentally came out as a weird cross between Thor and Rocket lol.
like tbh I'm kinda glad I'm not super into tv but it makes me sad sometimes bc I miss out on a lot of those cultural references
I'm literally so fucking lazy when it comes to watching movies or tv though
Same
I should rewatch lotr
Me @ Skyline band room last week
like the thing he says when he leaves the shire at the end, I can't remember the exact quote but it's something like "this isn't home for me anymore/I don't deserve to be here anymore"
Truth
he does have a lot of lines that consistently hit me right in the feels though
It's interesting for the first 20 minutes
I have mixed feelings about frodo and I know I'm supposed to have mixed feelings about frodo but still
Burdened, lethargic, and involuntarily edgy
Frodo is pretty much just an IB student
Same
The first one caught the setting-off-on-an-adventure vibe really well
I think a big part of why I liked them is bc I like bilbo as the mc a lot more than frodo tbh
really? the last one's my fave and the first is my least fave
First one was alright, the latter two were a snoozefest
tolkein's writing is brilliant but ridiculously dense and not really my style
also, I love lotr, but I like the movies a lot more than the books despite having read all of them
unpopular opinion: I love the hobbit movies
It hits pretty much every fantasy trope, so messing with them is really fun
It makes D&D a lot more fun if you ever wanna get into that lol.
that's fair
Granted, don't expect anything super novel. It set the tone for the genre, so a lot of plot points and features of Middle Earth feel familiar because so many other people draw inspiration from it.
I'm hot and cold on it. It can either be extremely immersive or a snooze. The translation of the books to film really honestly made it more tolerable (but you lose a lot of the lore).
i can do 2.5 hours
and do you actually like this series
Before starting my current D&D campaign, my brother asked us what tone we wanted for the campaign, and my stance was firmly "if you get all Lord of the Rings on me, I will fall asleep before we hit the first town"
3 og movies, but they're each like 2.5 hours long. There's 3 Hobbit movies, but those were poorly executed cash grabs
how many movies are there
Fair enough
did i mentioned that i was bored
It's still bland as fuck, I gotta say. I love the idea of rewatching it and always say I want to because I love emersing myself in that world. It's really deep, and the narrative is interesting. At the same time, it takes itself super damn seriously, and it's a mental commitment to get into that mindset.
it took me multiple tries to get into harry potter i guess
it's been awhile
maybe i should try reading or watching lord of the rings again
hm
Yeah, but they're extraordinarily extensive in fantasy and also commonly portrayed in a similar fashion than traditional fairy tale settings: they're smart, dangerous, can often communicate, occasionally rather greedy, etc.
well dragons have been in lore forever
You got your elves, you got your dwarves, you got your dragons, and you got your halflings. There's a reason a lot of those recur in a lot of fantasy settings.
Yeah, it basically sets a standard
?
Ok, that's fair enough
really
I mean, it's also worth noting that a big part of why people like Lord of the Rings is because it's seen as the genesis of modern fantasy
i'm just a sucker for ironically cyclical story telling tho
like i think Beauty and the Beast's ending would be a thousand times better if Gaston became a beast at the end
although
I recently reread the last book of Eragon and I came to the conclusion that Nasuada in the future will become a Galbatorix-like dictator
Granted, there's still a lot of narrative structure, but that's the appeal
Honestly, it's like reading a creatively written history textbook but history's rewritten into a more interesting fantasy setting
i feel like i could like Game of Thrones if I got deeper into the series because i think the last time i picked up the book i skipped to the back of the book just to see if it got better and it was actually interesting
it was just a dense block of me being extremely bored and at some point i was like "fuck this, it's not worth it"
I personally can appreciate it, but I can't live in it
Which is the appeal to some people
It can occasionally seem bland because it's bleak as fuck
i just found Game of Thrones boring and Lord of the Rings not that memorable
Eragon is fairly light-hearted as far as fantasy goes
because I like Eragon a lot
and is it like Eragon?
ok that's been referenced enough times that i think i should watch it
It's like if Thor: The Dark World wasn't a mess
Yeah, Game of Thrones has that kind of approach
Lord of the Rings just thrusts you into a fantasy world and tells you a bleak history. It's dead serious, the stakes are high, and there's little attempt to connect the audience into the world (which is immersive in its own way). You get a fuck ton of lore to the point where Tolkien invented actual languages.
i tried to read that thing like three times and i could never get through it
ok to be fair, i also hated the first book of Game of Thrones
It's usually has a degree of light-hearted curiosity with some of that wide-eyed world discovery shit
Because fantasy is usually presented differently
Yeah, I made you read the Hobbit, which has a bit more light-heartedness to it
but usually i love fantasy
Lord of the Rings is just dead serious fantasy, which doesn't click with some people.
didn't *you* make me read the book?
i dunno, it was a while ago
I don't remember much
Yeah, alright, sounds like the og trilogy
*a* hobbit, i should say
i remember the hobbit had the ring already and he used it to wreak havoc and gandolf made him give it up?
The Hobbit trilogy or the og Lord of the Rings trilogy?
huh
wait
or
the first one i think?
Which movie?
It's not for everyone
i read one of the books and i watched one of the movies
What did you do to try?
i tried to get into the lord of the rings and never could
This sounds like that one time I spent watching the Lord of the Rings extended cuts all at once with Scott and Courtney
and then an episode or two of "post season" stuff
each episode of anw is like 80-90 minutes
there are two episodes in each city and there are like 5 cities
then another 3-4 episodes for the finals
But the games are really long
Yes
are baseball players actual athletes
Jane, I watch baseball
it's also not something you wanna just sit an entire day and watch
because everyone is fit
so sitting on my ass all day watching it makes me feel bad
Big mood
i have crushes on like half the participants and hate the other half
I mean, it's not something I'd watch on my own, but I'd be down to watch shit with my friends
and REALLY?
that sounds terrible
no
Sure
hi, do you want to watch the entire 11th season of American Ninja Warrior with me again
Have you ever just wanted to not get out of bed the entire day? Cuz this is that moment
_I'm running out of things to watch on Hulu_
An ideal weekend
That's the fucking life
i had one day where i just did laundry and watched Hulu while i waited for the clothes to finish in the machine
Gonna be honest, I kinda wanted this for like years upon years. It's starting to get the point where it's problematic for my health/lifestyle, but I haven't stopped enjoying it
i made a list of activities i need to do but most of it is p boring and stuff i can't even do yet
"pack for college"
"hang w Ray"
"paint hydroflask"
Hobbies, personal projects, soak up all that nothingness you craved when we were dying
what do you suggest i do
Something something work to live don't live to work
idk
work
Uh, I mean, I don't think that's healthy in itself
just send me to school
I don't know what to do with my life if it's not school anymore
everyone else left for college, i quit my job (which i don't regret because i hated it goddamn) and all my uw friends are busy with something or other
Based on what we've said so far, I'm willing to bet if used to be different and they just never adjusted the start
i'm so _bored_
yea having quarters is nice
i don't know why we don't start until almost october
More classes total, less at once
I still like having quarters tbh
Honestly, that's normal
for christmas
i don't need a month break
I keep getting told that I'll appreciate it down the road
give me a fuckin NORMAL schedule
it's wack
i also highkey hate that uw starts so late
that must be it
I think it's more about their specific college experiences
They acknowledge it's a great school though
wow
rip!
Similar feelings to what we feel towards Skyline
they hate umich that much?
I think they just wanted to complain about UMich again
He and Courtney said something about UW having less random-ass breaks
but I know for a fact that the past 2 years they've ended roughly the same time as skyline
it might just be me misremembering
maybe the system's changed
huh
i feel like my brother said something similar
My brother, who did grad school at UW
by whom??? I'm not even going and I knew this
Ok, well, I was fucking lied to
you start a month later than everyone else
idk how you thought that
thats not including finals either
so I was right
so you end in june
]
UW usually finishes in May. This year was an exception.
Barring snow that, oh idk, kills a student
I feel like this is false, bc a lot of my UW friends had finals the same time as us last year
We finish in May
most US schools get out in may
you finish mid-june
You have less breaks, which is why you get out earlier than US-semester schools. However UW is still gonna get out at a similar time to a US-semester school.
I can take a summer term and still have july and aug
and yeah I do have less break but I don't mind
yee
god damn for real?
Canada does semesters differently than US schools cuz there's less breaks
I'm done mid-april
so am I
They're on semesters
everyone who starts before you is gonna be done before you
so false
I'm pretty sure Cindy's the only one who gets out before we do tbh
^
you'll swallow those words when we're still in school and they're out
Not having school is even greater
7 days a week
college is great
which is at least 4 days a week
is my regular bedtime when I don't have to get up before 10
till like 2-3
i didn't know how long a while was
I said I'd be up for a while
rocket/undecided
who did we say cindy was?
"is [cindy] asleep?"
"no, i'm pretty sure [she's] dead"
all i can think about is that scene with thor in endgame
i thought you went to sleep like an hour ago
oh is cindy still awake?
ib: you don't have a choice. you're already asleep, whether you like it or not.
now: when the reality that you don't have a life sinks in, sleep for that feeling of temporary death
now im just like
well
i'll sleep when i feel sleepy enough, not like i have plans lmao
in ib it was like SLEEP WHEN YOU CAN, YOU MAY NOT GET TO AGAIN
only during the morning and afternoon
constantly
^
if anything IB made me want to go to sleep more
thanks, ib
phat mood
i refuse to go to sleep, however
me too lol
i'm like delirious dont do this
i know i am
you know im right
no u is just gen x surrender
wdym?
dont flatter me like this gene
https://tenor.com/view/dont-do-that-avengers-black-panther-we-dont-do-that-here-gif-12042935
no u
but you say i'm wrong, therefore you're also wrong
since we're twins
because if you're right, i'm also right
ah, but that's where you're wrong
you're offended because i'm right
excuse you
and kidnapping her and taunting her with pizza breath is your method?
because of deception and trickery
she loves me
just not you
ill let her visit them
we already knew you wanted to steal her away from her FAMILY
we knew you were going to feed her PIZZA
excuse you??
you were already a danger to skye
and you'll never see her again
ill steal skye
ill
ill
or i swear to god
don't do it
or am i
W H A T
i'm gonna kill ur minecraft cats
😉
like "oh ok he's not actually that into tom holland"
"....or is he"
see you just ruined it
although that is one damn fine ass
im not actually that thirsty for tom holland lmao. most of it is for comedic effect
so no
no murder
would you kill your minecraft cats to sleep with tom holland
i don't want you to say a specific thing, just curious to the answer
yeah, sure
i guess?
marry tom, fuck chris, kill spongebob?
what do you want me to say
Yes
there's a very different dynamic going on here with spongebob
what
w h a t
i don't see the issue
yes
he's an animated sponge
wait what
can you play fuck marry kill with tom holland, chris hemsworth and spongebob
yeah
so no change in your answer
if there were no moral dilemmas, i'd pick spongebob
sigh alright
that sounds like an excuse for letting someone die
spongebob is gone or Tom is
he'd just be gone
you wouldn't be committing murder
spongebob is more of a national treasure than i love tom holland tbh, although based on your first question, you're kinda asking me to commit murder for spongebob, which had to be a hard no
i really love tom holland and spongebob is a national treasure
this is why i asked these questions
excuse you, don't put words into my mouth
okay so what i'm hearing is 
1. you don't love tom holland _that_ much when it comes down to it
2. spongebob is ok
Rihanna is beautiful
and badass and incredibly smart and talented
top celebrity crush is probably rihanna my god she's gorgeous
no one I'm into as much as gene's into tom
part of the journey is the end. i'm sure i could move on from the dream of the hunk sandwich with enough effort.
well still, i'll take the normal life
oh
you would never meet them as anything other than a ~~crazy~~ fan
that'd no longer be a normal life
i'll take normal life. once noah teaches me how to throw sandwiches at them, i'm sure i'll be able to seduce them anyways
wait Cindy who are your celebrity crushes? Do you have anyone you're as into as Gene is into Tom?
no
am i wrong
are you saying my normal life is solely looking at memes?
tbh I'd take the normal life
wait
no you have the orgy and you are not allowed to see memes again or you never meet the actors outside of like fan meets and you `spend all your time on the internet looking at memes`
-no hunk sandwich
-spend all your time on the internet looking at memes
are you saying living my life in a hunk sandwich orgy?
wdym life as normal?
hunk sandwich and you cannot see any memes ever again or life as normal?
i'm just saying
would you rather not?
i enjoy complexity
this has been a thoroughly complex would you rather
there are enough marvel memes to go around. not quite as many as spongebob memes, but i think i'd still take the MCU end
oh so if i took your memories of it you wouldn't take the hunk sandwich?
that's a tough sell, but based on how you phrased it, i'd still have memory of spongebob as well as spongebob memes, so i'll take the MCU half of the offer
they can't all inexplicably hate you
i mean yea i guess
so basically this is MCU + hunk sandwich vs. spongebob
and you get to watch spongebob as much as you'd like
would you rather take part in a hunk sandwich and never watch spongebob again or spiderman and every Chris's character leaves the MCU in ways that anger you as much as Chris Evan's character leaving the MCU
just like chrismas
in fact, it'll be amazing
it'll work out fine
chris collection
i'll just get the other chrises too
but you killed any chance of being with tom holland
i'm definitely down for that
oh my
i don't remember this
wdym?
what? I said Tom Holland and a Chris of your choice
why would you say that
why
*inhales*
also
this means you'll never achieve the hunk sandwich
Why Chris Hemsworth?
ya know it
because your thirst for marvel ass is unquenchable
why?
i actually laughed out loud
there's always chris hemsworth. im preserving spongebob.
ok then can i revise it
spongebob is preserved forever but tom holland meets you and immediately hates you for reasons he won't disclose
~~of course i'm gonna pick spongebob in order to lessen the world population, slowly inching my way towards halving it for the sake of perfect balance~~
tom holland or not
ok, honestly, this is someone's life we're talking about
he might be dead, you don't know
yeah
idk if that's any better he could be being tortured by the chinese gov for all we know
this is fucking intense
is he ok? holy shit
but not dead?
He's MIA
No one knows where he is, he's just missing
cuz as much as i treasure spongebob, idk if i'm gonna kill someone, let alone tom holland, over it
or just forgotten into obscurity
dead?
is he like
when you say tom holland is lost forever
would you rather date Tom Holland and have every episode of spongebob lost forever or have Spongebob be conserved for posterity for all eternity but Tom Holland  is lost forever
sure
can i ask you a would you rather question
watching spongebob right now and almost forgot how much of a national treasure this show is
Hahahahahhahahahah
Me: Mariners, why are you beatng this first-place team. We're supposed to be tanking, guys. Why are you fucking letting the draft pick slip away.
Mariners: *blows a 7-run lead in a fashion that still manages to be disappointing in a lost season*
Me: <:PK:610932426147102740>
Someone help. I'm whistling the pizza time song to myself out of boredom.
even if I don't end up doing it like I brought some music, and I kinda wanna learn some pop chords n shit bc they're easy and tend to be crowdpleasers
That sounds so lit
Yooo, if you get into the jazz ensemble, you gotta send video of the performances
the only one I'm really set on is voc, which is like the outdoors thing. also it gives me a climbing wall discount if I join lol
but we'll see there's a shit ton of clubs and volunteer stuff I'm also interested in
I didn't do a lot of jazz training but I loved the few pieces I did perform
I'm thinking of applying for jazz ensemble
I just don't really know where they are yet lol
yeah
Do you guys have public music rooms anywhere on campus?
1 am on fri/sat
on weekdays, anyway
Ah
our quiet hours start at 9 pm
You're normally up then though
the only one I know of is super not soundproof and I'm like only free past 10 pm so that's awk
I need to find a piano practice room at some point
it's p lit that she brought it though
lmao
You won’t get any sleep any time bas-soon
Might as well say
Rip
my roommate's also here though and she's practicing bassoon so idk if I'll be able to nap
I've been falling asleep all day. and this was like the earliest I will ever have to get up for anything school-related
I skipped the pep rally
lol
I'm working on my freshman 15, gotta get that bench up
-relevant thing my CNA said after someone spilled their chocolate milk
“Chocolate everywhere”
freshman 50 here I come
this is so Not Good
no amount of exercise is gonna offset the amount of free chocolate I've eaten today
I just woke up to this, so I'm a little late, but I'm really sorry that that happened, Salina. I'm basically gonna echo what Cindy said because she hit everything, but you're a wonderful person who's gonna do amazing things. You don't deserve this shit, and I'm really sorry you have to put up with it.
I'm dead serious though, you're gorgeous and brilliant and somehow still one of the most genuinely "want to do good in this world" motivated people I've ever met, and you're gonna do far better in the "real world" than the rest of your family, debt or no debt
I get that kinda shit a lot too
yeah that's true
it's always somethign stupid that gets blown out of proportion though
yeah for real
but i find it laughable that this is the issue that it comes down to
that's kind of the reality of the college education system
to be honest i'm not scared of taking on more debt
he also threatened to not pay for college and to basically disown me (cut me off from everything)
'm sorry
I
bro people suck
this is fucking stupid
what the fuck lmao
like there's this knot of stress that's kind of forming and it's not coming undone
i'm just more wound up now
and kept ranting about how i was wrong and being stupid and how i'd be royally fucked when i stepped into the real world
i went on a walk to clear my head and then my dad followed me out
*kind of*
is it still going on??
aww salina
what is parenting
jfc
i hate that i'm told i'm being wild and ridiculous when someone else is throwing the tantrum
i am so fucking tired of being called the problem
When I became groot
when did cindy's username change
To the fashion channel
Shoe
shoe
now
that was not sarcasm it was approval and solidarity
I'm being more supportive than your gf smh
how was I shaming you
no her
Me????
you do it too
don't shame me
Uh huhhhhhh amazing
good plan
I'm gonna do it tomorrow night then
and me being the amazing student I am
jesus
ok
oh
oh fuck
then I realized it's due tomorrow
then I got onto my laptop to due homework due at 11:59
because I was lying in bed sleepy
I am physically compelled to question everything, you know this
Don’t question it
would it not be easier to send a shoe pic if you were on your phone
Idk
how does that make sense
I now have the energy to go take a photo of my shoes
and now that I'm on my laptop
4 hours shoe shopping today
oh fuck I'm degenerating back into british spellings
I've been taking up all her time over the last few days
And I don’t start clinical till Tuesday
Yeah he leaves tomorrow
tomorrow's labour day
oh wait
isn't it sunday?
I’ll wake up at like 8:30
And it won’t even be that early
Hoe I’m only getting up early to hang out with Noah
hoe go to sleep
And the color gets everywhere
it's too stiff and rough
I hate actual denim for the most part
but not jeans
also shorts
I now only wear t-shirts and jean like pants
yes
Noah learned how to society
(Which Gabe still does and he's going into senior year, I stopped at the end of Sophomore year)
And still wore athletic clothes exclusivity
And hadn't started to do my hair yet
And more annoying
Those quality shoulders
I was much smaller then
Thanks Jarrett
Ah
I remember writing about it in freshman year
Yeah Noah's pretty hot
Your eyes have like an amber/gold undertone
While my hair is reddish brown
My eyes are properly brown
I guess I see it now
Lmao
Ok I'm lagging a bit bc I'm outside. I believe him bc he confirmed it
I JUST SAW HIM TODAY
Is my eyewitness testimony not sufficient
I would like photo evidence of possible
He has like these medium honey brown eyes
Which is only when I get a shorter haircut
My hair is definitely reddish when it thins out
Huh
Esp in the light
There’s a p noticeable sprinkling of red
So you're the expert
No if you look close
Well you've spent more time looking into them than I have
That's also wrong
Wait what
Your hair is like borderline brown red
Also disagree
I disagree
Are they?
Neither is chocolate
My eyes and hair are both the same shade of brown
But I’m biased
I also love his hair
Not my type tho
I was kidding
Anyways Noah's actually pretty cute. He got the chocolate doe eyes thing going for him
Good work
Also I forgot to take my makeup off when I went swimming the other day so my mascara legit gave me black circles
It's an apt description
Gotta either get some serious black eyes or get out the spray paint
I am nocturnal and eat garbage
No hesitation
Lmao
Yes
Are you a raccoon then
I adore your hair, it's so fuckin smooth. Legs for DAYS. Absolute queen
My best friend is trash panda
Am groot
Am stick
SMH your lack of confidence is honestly offensive have you SEEN yourself
Ya girl is the bottom of the totem pole
Time to assume the worst
I was mostly talking about the girls
Yeah I really wasn't
she said "a lot of you"
how confident are you that you could be in the minority
I'm just waiting for <@503787499605458954>'s "I wasn't talking about you" comment
Such a compliment
I can’t tell
are we speaking seriously now
Wow
“Reasonably hot”
Honestly a lot of you are reasonably hot so I might be down
👀 👀 👀
<:KZ:607334139493875760>
Oh god
We shall have the largest orgy in the history of orgies
If Jiayi is on this, Jarrett is also definitely in
<:KZ:607334139493875760> <:KZ:607334139493875760> <:TH:605635628205604885> <:TH:605635628205604885> <:KZ:607334139493875760> <:KZ:607334139493875760> <:TH:605635628205604885> <:TH:605635628205604885> <:KZ:607334139493875760> <:KZ:607334139493875760> <:TH:605635628205604885> <:TH:605635628205604885>
I t ' s  o r g y  t i m e
Didn't Helen or Jiayi also once advocate for this?
Nudist family commune lol
No orgies for you
Idk dude
Not in my nudist family commune
Holy kale salad?
Not in front of my holy kale salad
Not in my Christian neighborhood
://////
5 shouldn't be too hard
Alright, well
Get out
Nope
Quintsome?
Therefore it’s 5
Fivesome?
5 is a ???????
4 is foursome
Idk if they count
Well, I found 4 willing participants in the elevator
3 is threesome
5
How many people do you need for it to be considered an orgy?
Sometimes Jane
Truth
And Emily
<:NR:605639306572464128>
Sigh
<@193229269076279298> is
Hey, I mean, I'm not the one who usually pushes the orgies
Por favor amigo
No orgies
Gene
Those half-naked guys did give their room number
Just saying
Oh boy
....
Ya never know
Also, maybe somebody's into that
Gotta clean that digestive system somehow
You’ll be farting out bubbles for days
Damn
Worst case scenario, I get frustrated and chew on the soap bar lol
Esp with a serrated edge
It’s harder than it seems
Maybe if she falls asleep
Lmao
I actually really want to do that though
That sounds fun, but my mom's kinda awake, so it'd be awkward
It’s a frustrating but kinda fun endeavor
Go to the bathroom with like a key or something and carve up a soap bar
Or if youre in a hotel
My mom's watching a Canadian drama thing I think
Draw?
Ah
I would, but I usually need a degree of privacy to write comfortably, and my parents being in the room makes it hard for me to think creatively
Like a story or journal or something
One thing that helps me is to write
L
My dad's snoring p hard, so at least he's sleeping ok
It's a rip
Nope
Got any melatonin?
Sad boi hours in full swing
But I have to be up semi-early tomorrow
Rip
It's almost midnight and I'm not at all tired because I slept a ton during the afternoon
I am indeed
Salty
You sound kinda
I’m sorry
Awww
but they have no salt
I thought they were like saltines
I just spent $3 on a pack of really disappointing crackers
And my mom's telling my dad to sleep on the floor because he snores too loud to share a bed with
My parents came back to the hotel room and are singing Country Roads
just like me hanging on to sanity
me after ib exams
Hanging on to life
what a trooper
my phone survived at 1%
It was p fun even though I was sitting on the side the whole time, but my parents seemed kinda done and had a five hour drive ahead of them lmao
And we left early lmao
L
(also, side note, while I love the people I do know here, no one at this wedding is like within a 10-year age radius of me, and a few of them are bordering shit faced levels of drunk, so dancing seems kinda unfun unless they put on like a super bop lol)
Usually, I'd just go for it until I got a headache, but holy shit, I think I'll pass tonight lmao
That's the definition of awkward
Dancing with my parents watching is by default very awkward
I've been in the city for 8 hours
Dancing badly is only awkward if you make it awkward if you just go for it it's fine
I'm kinda just sitting around waiting for sunset bc I'm too tired to walk more hoping my phone doesn't die lol
Mostly because I can only dance ironically
Update Two and the Electric Boogaloo: everyone started dancing, and I can't bring myself to even fake it while my parents are in the room
Update: this wedding is actually p cool
Bring your switch and play jackbox
Lmao thanks. Let's hope so.
you'll be fine :)
lol
I know like five people here lol. This will be interesting.
Riperoni
I am woefully underdressed for this wedding lmao.
i'm very invested in these adorable death machines
dead dinos make me sad
:(
Nice lmao
yup
Ah, the expensive one
the blue ppl one
Which Avatar?
did make me p sad tho :(
it was a p solid movie all around
watched avatar for the first time last night actually
rip
I would love to, but it depends on what my parents are doing since I'm kinda stuck sharing a room with them for a while. If I can, I will.
Sure
fr though does anyone wanna video call me tomorrow night
I didn't know I could have sadboi hours at 9 am either this is wack
anyways. I feel like I'm by far the most active person here rn lmao, idk if I'll keep that up throughout the year but I love you all 3000 and miss you guys tons
we hung out in her room for like 2 hours and then poked our heads into the bathroom at legit the same time to say we're going to sleep lol
my roommate and I go to sleep at like the exact same time it's lit
like I went to bed before midnight bc there was no one to talk to it was very strange
highkey though with me jiayi and helen at school and you on the east coast and noah/salina occupied last night it was v v quiet
I didn't know I could have sad boi hours at 9:30 AM hahaha somebody send help
East Coast is big rip. Y'all's most active hour is 4AM over here, and I have to wake up knowing y'all won't be up for like another 5 hours at least.
oof
My family is a nightmare at sharing a room.
My dad snores really loud, my mom (probably?) has insomnia, and I'm a night owl being asked to (*gasp*) sleep before midnight
UwU
Pls no
idk, do you want it to make you a catgirl?
Does that make me a cat girl
what
Closets you'll get to flying
^
water is the BEST
No you're just too much of a cat lady, that's why you don't like water
Water is bad
Bc
boooo
I think that too
Idk, cause some people don't like swimming
I think I need to make more athletic friends
why does no one wanna come swimming w me 😦
Thank you. I'll try my best.
Hang in there
It’s the jet lag talking
Aw
It's only 7:30 and I'm lying down on a bed because I don't want to do anything, and I feel kinda bad about that
I'm all the way in Pittsburgh and I still feel like a fucking lethargic ass potato
Awww I'm sorry
I can't sleep since I got here
Fuck off, Jarrett
harsh
damn
Seattle Supersonics gonna make the playoffs before the Mariners do
Well my whole ass body hurts now so mission accomplished I guess
I'm flexing my Mariners cap in the Detroit airport because these suckers have to put up with an even worse baseball team than I do
Ok, good
yee!
Do they know what they're doing?
oh I'm heading to the climbing wall probably. I made other friends who will help with weights
Sure
Boy oh boy
Uh
Salina you down to spot me?
Lol, should have practiced more with us
Jkjk I appreciate you dude
Hopefully one that’s less dysfunctional than Jarrett
And if you think that’s a risk bring a friend to be a spotter
Don’t drop shit on yourself
Have funnnn
Ooferoni, take care of yourself, Cindy
so hopefully I don't injure myself
but I'm about to head to the gym anyways bc I need to burn off some energy and this is the first free time pre-2 am I've had like since I got here
Good work
also also my abs and right arm are sore for some reason I can't explain
also I just discovered a huge-ass bruise on my leg from last night and idr how I got it lol
Death
still dying
I brought it and have been taking it
Awww, sorry, Cindy. Maybe get some allergy medication.
bruh I'm like hella allergic to something in this area and idk what it is but I've been sneezing NONSTOP
Yeah rip
Ok but like it might actually
Great Depression Two and the Electric Boogaloo
I find it much stranger that a new decade is just around the corner
Like, damn
Dude, it's only August, and 2019 has already been crazy, man
You need to go out and do it now so I'm no longer *partially* wrong
Fair point
see: the thing you tagged me in earlier
I meant in general
not that
How is it partially?
partially correct doesn't count
I should keep a tally of all the times I'm right
no
But am I wrong though
That's kinda yike to think about
I'm sure if Cindy walked up to a bunch of middle aged naked men and asked for a dick pic she wouldn't have a problem getting them
On public property
In the US at least
I checked, it is
I'm not actually sure if it's legal to take pictures of people on a nude beach, but I feel like I should know this
Ah yes, gotta establish yourself as "that" person
I thought about taking pics but then I was like ok I'm not that weird
Lmao
When am I ever wrong
I hate that there's a degree of truth to this
Na nothing too bad, <@503787499605458954> just posted a  photo compilation of the best and worst dicks she saw at the nude beach
Truth
Lmaooo
but tbh every channel has the potential to be nsfw with you guys
i was about to click on the #nsfw channel while making my rounds to read everything you guys sent, but i'm at the front of a lecture hall and i managed to quickly backtrack lol
G'night and have fun dancing
night loves
I think I'm just gonna dance off my energy for a bit and then sleep
Lol
actually that reminded me I should do that rn
yeah
I mean, that's still hella amazing
I do need to get a gym membership but it's like $35 for the year so idk if that even counts
Daaaamn
nope
Do you have to pay for it or is it attached to tuition?
considering that hockey is the biggest sport here
I guess I shouldn't be surprised
I'm jealous thoooo
and so canadian lol
it's hella hype
That's amazing
DUDE WHAT
dude we have a skating rink
I'm going to the gym w friends tomorrow though
Cronchy carpets
my dorm carpet is also rough
ah yes, same
like idk how to describe it but it provides 0 cushioning and has this... woven? embroidered?? detailing on it that digs into my skin
my carpet hurts
can you not just do it on carpet?
I wanna try yoga sometime but it feels like Not My Thing
nah to do some bodyweight stuff for when I'm super keyed up like this
to do yoga?
I wish I brought mine
I want a yoga mat
I just checked they're all closed 😦
it will get rid of the hyper and tire you out
go the the gym
Try to do something to calm down and sleep when you can
Yike, I'm sorry
kinda wanna exercise but I feel like I'd be too awake then
I'm both REALLY fucking tired and really hyper for some reason
cranked up to a 12
but like
Ah yes the "I'm the parent so I'm right" argument
god i hate being an armchair psychologist but my sister and i both agree she's an emotional abuser and raging pathological narcissist
but there's just this awful feeling that ebbs and flows because i know that whatever i say won't be respected and there's basically no way to deal with it
i know to not keep arguing
now i'm just frustrated
so
it's like why yes i know i cannot fully understand the parental experience but you have these gaping inconsistencies in your argument that you are fully unwilling to acknowledge
you're not a parent you don't fucking understand
i tried to pin her down for all the issues in her argument and it was literally like
What kinda stuff were they pulling that on you for?
before it was like lmao wow you really think i'm an idiot
now it's more like wow you really want me to stay an idiot
i'm starting to stop being slightly entertained by how adult hypocrisy can be brushed off with "fuck off you're too young to understand"
All users have left the voice channel. The player has been paused.
That's what we're here for dw
I may be back to bitch more later
G'night and take care!!
Night yall
Well I guess I'm gonna keep trying to sleep
Hopefully you're feeling a bit better soon
Hey, no worries
As someone who's been stung twice, it's been "save the bees by running away from them cuz they're terrifying even though I'm a grown-ass adult"
Anyways thanks for accompanying me on my miserable journey
Im trying very hard to stay "protect the precious bees" instead of "fuck bee lives" rn
<@503787499605458954> try to lie down/sit down if you haven't already and watch/listen to something to distract yourself if possible. It'll feel better if you can get your mind off of it.
Thank you, Fredboat

To clarify, taking ibuprofen for bee stings is apparently decently common
This is so sad
Ok I don't wanna walk to find ice so water it is
Although I'd attempt to find ice or cold water first
If you can't sleep, it's probably a problem
Not at all. Just don't take too much if you can help it.
Painful if I walk
It's mostly itchy and hot
Maybe take one if you can't find any ice or cold water
How pathetic am I if I start popping advil for this though
Actually yeah lmao
This is a probably a reach, but do you have access to over-the-counter painkillers?
(also, tell her I say hi sometime)
To see if she's somehow awake
You could do the ol' "press the ear against the door and listen for sound" move
Oof ok, I can understand that
Lena has a fridge with ice in it but I don't wanna wake her up
If not, refrigerate a bottle of water or something
I guess I'm gonna go look
Good question
Is there an ice machine in your dorm?
Sigh
I hiked with this yesterday and it was Fine
I was fine for like 3 days
Or an ice pack?
Do you have access to ice?
Literally nothing but silently scream
Maybe make some plans to get some in the morning. Idk what else can be done at the moment
Sadly
No
And did you pack any anti-itch cream?
Feels like it but I can't tell
Actually though, is it swelling more?
But those are a whole 'nother animal, in both a figurative and literal sense
Huh interesting
It does work for jellyfish stings though
No, it doesn't. We're just kidding
Or have a penis. The primary advantage to having a penis is being able to pee while standing up.
Does that actually do anything???? I am confusion
Or into a bottle/glass and pour it over
It's on the bottom of my right foot
Idk how I would even contort my body for that
F
jk maybe don't
Is it swelling more or something?
pee on it
Daaamn I'm sorry. The one from a week ago? That's wack af
Y'all the pain and itching from the bee sting I got on my foot a week ago just returned in FULL force and it doesn't look infected but I'm freaked out and this is hell I legit can't sleep
ib
But not bad
Like not great of course
I thought it was alright
^
a lot lmao
Rip
What was wrong with highschool gene?
Man
Oof
I really fucking hated high school though, so don't get me wrong. My subconscious is just playing mind games on me. I'm not really ranting. Just wanted to share it cuz I thought it was interesting.
But like I pictured myself in band camp during one of the dreams and then woke up realizing, "shit, half of these people are at school in Montana now, and I might not see some of them ever again cuz we were never super close come to think of it"
But also kinda funny, cuz I'll wake up and be like "yep I'm a high school student" before realizing "wait, shit, I have college in a month and will never be obligated to step into that cursed building again"
And it's been really fucking depressing
Not like going forward in time, but like a 13th grade or something
But like
I've been having a lot of really wack dreams the past couple nights that I'm actually starting senior year in a week
Lol
ooferoni
god bless the friend who dmed me and told me
I made a spam and it was accidentally linked to/shared to my fb for some dumbass reason
Riperoni
My blood sugar just gets really wonky sometimes I think
Ate some stuff with sugar
I’m doing okay
Take advil
Oof you doing ok?
But you get up and you traded headache 1 for a different headache
That sad feeling when you take a nap w a headache hoping it’ll be okay when you get up
... do I want to know about old people shits?
the cutoff bits
lol
Am traumatized please send help
I also do enjoy that  c r o n c h
I mean
Aren't we all
Loool
I know it does. I won't stop any dream analysis, but I also think it's pretty clear I'm scared of eating spiders.
Huh. Could say a lot about subconscious fears
That would explain why everyone was desperately trying to come to some imaginary party I wasn't hosting though
I fucking wish
Just become Tom Holland
I also remembered thinking "if this spider is radioactive, do I still become spider-man if I'm the one taking a bite?"
It really quickly crawled into the part I was taking a bite out of as my mouth was closing
Sounds absolutely dreadful
That stuff about the spider
Jkjk
You were the one who told me to go back to sleep though, so this is very indirectly your fault lmao
And yes, it was hella vivid
You were in the car too
That's a hella vivid dream
Jesus
Then I wake up, cuz *that* is where my subconscious draws the line
Scene cuts, dream ends, I'm eating a sandwich with a spider on it as I mentioned before
And then I continued walking home in the rain
And I'm thinking like "damn, fam. I just wanted to see my friends, and somehow literally everyone got my message, and I hadn't even gotten around to inviting all my friends. Like, I don't think Emily or Bethany ever showed"
I walked by a TV store, and through the window, I could see a headline for local news being like "Locals Angry Because Gene Hosts Party Then Turns Everyone Away"
And you guys know that movie/tv trope where a character walks by a store selling TVs and it shows some news relevant to the plof?
I think Adam Callahan drove by me, and he was the only I was able to explain that there had been a mix up to, and he kinda got it, but he was still pissed and just drove off
I remember being really scared, cuz I started having to walk home in the rain when it was dark out from the highlands with 9% battery life on my phone (oddly specific detail, but I remember this for sure)
So I just yell really loudly at them to fuck off cuz they were intruding on a hang out, and they start angrily walking away cuz they felt entitled to joining in on whatever was happening
I tried to explain there wasn't a party, but they weren't having any of it
The other refused to give me a ride and kinda demanded they come to my party
And it was raining really fucking hard now, so it was cold and wet
And Ethan drove my car off without me to go back to my place, leaving me there with a bunch of confused Skyline randos
These weren't even people I particularly disliked. Like, I think Adam Callahan and Isaac Muhlstein (love that guy) were there
But like I hadn't seen them in months
I looked behind me, and there was like another van and a half's worth of people behind me who were all kinda expecting a party or something
And then there wasn't a seat for me
And soon enough, a car that sat 9 people (there were four seats in the back) was full
And a bunch of randos like Noah Holst and like Grace Meyers or whatever her name was started getting into the car
I don't even think y'all realized cuz like Cindy was in the front and not looking back and Salina and I think Jiayi weren't saying people
But then people started filling into the car, and there were even more people than I originally remembered
I'm pretty sure some people had been drinking and were drunk, including Ethan
Weird detail: Ethan Hines was driving my car
My car somehow had three rows to it, so it was fine at first, cuz it was like, "oh, there's just like two extra people," so I arrange foe everyone to get in
Cuz all these random Skyline people started showing up thinking I was hosting an open-housw party and just met us outside the restaurant
But then it got really bad
I also dreamed that I tried to host a small get together, and y'all were there, and it was pretty chill cuz we were eating at a restaurant in the highlands and about to head to my place
I dreamed I saw a spider on my sandwich as I was about to eat it, but it was already there, and my mouth was already committed to taking a bite out of the part with the spider
Welcome back
I have emerged from the darkness
Good
Ehhh fiiiiine I'll try
Turn off that phone or laptop or whatever
Go backkkk
It's not working
For like an hour and a half
Go back to sleep man
Geez
I'm just gonna stay in my bed a while because it vaguely resembles a hug
I'm trying here
Ay, man, look
3:30
Yeah
And imma safely assume you didn't go to sleep before midnight
Probably because its like 9
I woke up feeling suuuper dead inside and idk why
Is it dream analysis hours?
I guess "long-lost" is a bit dramatic, I'm still in touch w a lot of them
I.e. one was Jenny Yoon, I met her in NYC last summer, she lives in LA
People I love who I don't really see anymore
Long-lost?
Ok I went back to sleep and had another dream about partying with long-lost friends
yike
Then I woke up
It ended with like three of them with their arms buried in my chest
Yea
basically prometheus/alien
so
... what?
I had fun dream as well, stuck in a submarine with spider creates that infect people and make them eat you, basically spider zombies
But also a person had released them on the sub on purpose to see what would happen
Don't stress about it too much. Nightmares are kinda wack. I'm really sorry that happened to you though.
I'm good I'm mostly just shook @ my subconscious
I'm so sorry. That sounds horrible.
Are you alright?
Holy shit
Woke up from a fucking terrifying dream about surviving a school shooting
I just
Daaaaamn
come on
but she was dancing for like 2+ hours w like 10 diff routines
Poor kid. She deserves better.
she had a couple of rougher edges on a few routines
she did her debut when she was younger than madhu
but like
tbf i think ramya (madhu's sister) has a different sort of "way" of dancing if that makes sense
idkkkk
Asshats
Whymst the hell do they feel so compelled to compare
well that's fuckin rude
it's her moment, let her have it, and sit yo ass down
and it made me really fucking mad
and wouldn't shut up
"madhu's debut was better"
but the only other asians there were like
and damn the girl is good
i went to madhu's sister's traditional dance debut
that's an insanely good workout
on another note
well that's a good workout
nice
and I'm feeling ded
While we're at it, today I've played a total of 5 hours of tennis
It stung me on the finger, but it was a damn close call
jk jk
you're always halfway to treating it
oh boi
oh god
I got stung once while trying to take a piss in the woods
aka stepping on it and shoving the stinger into my foot
yeah I got stung in like the worst way possible
<@503787499605458954> do you have any ointment/anti-itch cream?
She stepped on it
How tf dod you get stung
I'm suffering
wasp/bee sting has graduated from mildly painful to FUCKING ITCHY
I kinda just laid awake until like 4AM or something last night
It's v nice to wake up early naturally ngl but it feels so WEIRD and I'm like not being as  productive as I'd like since 10-2 is usually Peak Working Hours
Y'all I've had no energy past 10 pm for the last week
its the grand finals
sike
seeding stage or whatever they call it
aint it still group stage?
man
And I wanna watch it
But Serral is curb stomping Elazer
I should go to sleep
Fuck it's 3:26 AM
This is gonna be a long night
I feel asleep and got woken up by my mom. Karma's a bitch
then just stay in bed and on your phone? Idk
My mom is still awake since she has trouble falling asleep
I might try the bathroom thing but idk
I don't have access to drugs
4 hours?
either use drugs or go to the bathroom and be real quiet in there for four hours
What do
I won't be able to sleep for another four hours
I slept most of the way here
Ok now my dad is trying to sleep
We're in the same hotel room
This is gonna end well lmao
Guys, my Mom's already trying to sleep but I haven't slept before midnight all summer
Alright, I'm glad to hear it's healing quickly
It's slightly swollen and I'm no longer hiking tomorrow but we chillin
Yeah I'm good
I am so sorry. Are you feeling a bit better?
Damn
Oh dear god that sounds horrible
Was pretty gross though I had to rip the stinger out
Hurt like a bitch for the first 5-10 mins but now I'm like fine
Honestly it wasn't The Worst
Today I stepped on a wasp barefoot and got stung for the first time ever
Wholesome
You
what brought you online all of a sudden
ah
Im here sir
<@!233062637922025472> I see you're on do not disturb
how's still up?
Update: I enjoy suffering for the sake of a good story
I'm not sure if I love this or hate this. Although I'm realizing I'm gonna suck at having roommates. I'm here like "oh, I can't shit around on YouTube for another 3 hours cuz I'll wake my mom up. Hell, I can't even browse Reddit cuz I'll wake up my mom 3 hours later when I need to use the bathroom."
My mom: Clear off the spare bed. Your Dad is snoring too loud and I need to sleep here in your room (I sleep in my brother's old room cuz larger bed).
Me: Uhm, ok. Give me ten minutes.
My mom: Sure, five minutes.
Me, five minutes later: Ok, here you go.
My mom: Thank.
Me: Yeah, no problem.
The bed I'm sleeping in:
I have some meat in my backpack
I've had like no nutrition today
i'm sorry cindy
oof
anyways. that's my current sadboi situation I guess. Salina, I am sorry and I feel you
and like even more resentful than usual
but I'm v Tired of all this
I was like ??? it's 80 degrees? and I'm layering a jacket. idk man. she's acting like everything's fine again, and I guess I kinda did that too
she was basically like have fun getting raped in the future
context: the day I left for cali she screamed at me for wanting to wear a tank top to the airport till I had like a full on mental breakdown
I came home intending to just ignore her for a few days but when it came down to it I felt like that would just make things worse
I like really don't know how to feel @ my mom rn
makes the other person really stop and think about how badly they want it
I personally prefer the belt of grenades with all the pins linked together method
long reach
carry an umbrella around? It's a weapon
when winter comes around and it gets dark before classes end you shouldn't walk alone, or carry pepper spray with you (or both)
yeah fair
are the drugged up raping homeless people gonna care exactly what you're wearing?
thats wack af
whatmst the fuck
to be stereotypical for a second
but you gotta ask the question then
well yea it's Seattle
but... leggings?
but thats a yike
to be fair uw is sketch in places
idk dude idk
And skin doesn't?
????
because it "shows your shape"
Why?
wooooooOOOOOooooo implications
my mom just told me it's a bad idea to wear leggings in college
Rip
today is a ranty day for me for some reason
The sammaish library should have one
If you're desperate ask my dad he'd be hella down to help
I do but am not home
Ask Gabe
@everyone does anyone have a scanner i could use
i have a hospital volunteering interview on thurs morning and then they just told me my immunization record is fucked
yall someone shoot me
rip
Don't fuck the mosquito
Fuck mosquitos, man
Hopefully it heals soon
Awww I'm sorry
I want to die
I have a huge ass mosquito bite on my ankle
I got six hours of sleep last night and can barely function. How did I ever do homework?
I forgot how depressing it is to wake up and realize I accidentally fell asleep on the floor lmao
Wow Jarrett's mom is so wholesome
(also, just a second ago, cole wasn't even online, so it was just me)
F
Thank you, Jarrett (and thank your mom for us too). That's both very kind and true.
More freedom to do what you want without anyone else telling you what to do
Life gets better as you get older
My mom would like y'all to know that no matter what your parents are like, you guys will all grow up to be fine because there's a lot more to life that your parents just won't be in. And as far as raising kids goes, don't worry about it if you choose to do that because it'll be pretty easy--just don't do the things that you didn't like your parents doing
Backtracking to yesterday
On a more serious note
<@520095106888630348> <@340319804747415553> <@258094439636008971> <@503787499605458954>
I'm a little scared they're gonna try to jump the gun on it
They're aiming for 2021 to be competitive again, but I think that's optimistic and would expect something more like 2022 or 2023 for the rebuild to be complete
Thats probably enough time
Calling it right now
Mariners 2042 world series champs
Lol
No
Uh
Damn, they've done a pretty good job rebuilding actually now that I look at it
Heres where they go on a 60 game win streak and clinch the wild card
Still gonna need another few years though
It really has been a while since they've been relevant wow
They actually have a decent farm system
Never mind
Actually, lemme doubling check that
The Tigers fucked shit up and are still scrambling for any semblance of prospect talent
The Mariners are well on their way to a proper rebuild
Aint the mariners like almost as bad though?
It'll take quite a few years to rebuild
I mean, they fucked up their team pretty damn hard
Sometimes they'll say something like "just give it a few years"
Dear god I pity her soul
Sometimes people will yell like "go tigers"
She wear a tigers cap sometimes
My mom is from the Detroit area
Haha
If you're subject to living in Michigan, even the Detroit Tigers will seem like entertainment to you
People like some weird stuff
Some people like watching the Detroit tigers play
Golf is somehow a spectator sport
Like c'mon
That is my crappy way of saying everybody likes different things
There are very few feet involved
Despite the name
Because I will say
Are you saying these people get turned on by high school football games?
Gene some people like feet
I love the atmosphere of cold weather, mediocre food, and being packed with other sweaty teens who reek of hormones
But some people
Obviously not me
And some people just like the atmosphere
Id watch my friends play a sport
I dunno man
But that describes one football game the entire year (minus the sitting part)
I could maybe understand it if there was like a decent tailgate prior to the game with food trucks and shit or you could ACTUALLY SIT DOWN
Also, there are so many better options for meeting. At least meet and do something y'all enjoy. We over here playing music and Smash on our Switches. The other wackos are watching high schoolers dick around with an oddly shaped ball.
I'm not gonna watch my friends run around on a field. I can't interact with them
Remember its not what you do its who you do it with
And its also not rare to have friends on the team
It's an easy meeting place
The student section isn't even allowed to sit down for some weird-ass reason
Not much goofing off to be had unless you're in the band section where we can really do whatever the fuck we want
A high school sports game? Really?
But like
No fuck you
#thebestpartaboutamarinersgameisthehydroplanerace
Ok, I guess I kiiiinda get that
All that jazz
#banthewave
Do the wave
Look through the binoculars at the skyline
I could goof around and eat popcorn
But it was fun
It wasnt because i remotely cared about baseball
When I went to some mariners games back then
It is to goof around
Oh boy
But
Youre gonna hate this example
Okay
I would never really go to one on my own volition outside of a band context
I still don't understand why students went to sports games though. I was only there cuz I got to goof off with the band and was required to be there.
I'll take a free shirt to wear on a sad boi day
It was nice when they gave us free shirts tho ngl
School spirit was just a weird phenomenon I guess
But I guess you have a point
I still feel like there needs to be a way for this money to make its way around to teachers
Wack
And I think the sports director is on the school board too
Fair point. Band was told about it too, but Pitt wasn't aware it costed half as much as it did.
Theyre not even a part of it
Golf, tennis, baseball, basketball
I wouldnt think they'd be told about this
But any sport that's not football, soccer, or cheer I guess
Sports director yeah
Heres where the nitty gritty comes in though
I feel like someone related to sports could've said "yeah, maybe don't"
Rather than "fuck skyline sports"
But thats a more "fuck the school board"
Yeah
"that one time we magically pulled $11 million out of our asses and will pretend like we're not capable of doing again for our teachers"
I dont think sports are a real culprit as much as just poor general spending
While you could drain money from sports im sure there are other places too
Stadium aside
Again
But imma safely assume that sports are not that much
I don't really know the budgeting of skyline
But fund band jokes aside, seriously. Like, is there no way for this money to go towards teachers?
Honestly, we don't have enough marching uniforms either, but we're not complaining about that one lol
I didn't have a chair to sit in most of freshman year in band lol
Or, dear god, the stands
Also, they could at least spend a few bucks on fixing some of the chairs in the band room
Can this money get directed to teachers' salaries, or is that a separate route?
A new venture could fail still
No sport is suddenly going to vanish
Sports is a easy guarantee that there will be interest though
And I dont really think they're forced on students
There's demand for other things too
We spend money because there is demand
And the school board ain't getting fixed any time soon lol
Sports are good in concept, but I still have to disagree with the execution. Spending a bunch of money on them and heavy-handedly forcing them onto the students is kinda wack.
But I wanna say generally speaking sports are good
Which yeah could *reaaallly* use some reform
It went through the school board
And gonna be honest, as much as I joke about funding band, we used to get a fair amount of money too ngl.
I don't really have another example aside from the football stadium, but I doubt that's the only example out there. There has to be some degree of precedent before someone out there greenlights spending $11 million dollars.
A lot of the money for sports comes from people who want to do the sport
Unless you're cheer and have to pay $4000
But i do know that to play a sport you do need to pay a $200 fee
I dont have a total for that
How much goes into sports?
Just maintenance
But besides that sports aren't overly expensive
That was completely unnecessary
I again will *totally* give you the stadium
Not nearly as much as they do to sports
I see that as mostly the same thing
We provide money to clubs too
But that doesn't by any means justify the amount of money poured into sports
I'll concede that it's practical
Ok, fair point
Whenever you do any activity you have to accept that you're going to lose some time
One extreme there is literally just *not* doing a sport
If he couldnt handle coming home later then he shouldn't have done sports
And he could handle coming home later
It's still a little unfair to make them choose between one extreme or another
He started sports in junior year
Like lets use jiayi as an example
They're not forced to do sports
And again
That's not hard to make up
They miss like 30 minutes
honestly, better than having students miss class then come home at 10PM on a thursday night
Cant just play eastlake 20 times
The district is big
*to move the team you have to move the school*
*the teams are based in school*
d o n ' t  h a v e  t e a m s  t o o  f a r  f r o m  e a c h  o t h e r  p l a y
Woodinville is coming or we're going there
Where they gonna play?
Kay Gene if two teams play each other
yeah, but you don't have to drive to fucking woodinville or something for it
Goes for pretty much all sports
Cant just hold a tennis meet without tennis courts man
uh, you could, idk, not do games where you have to drive an hour out to the middle of bumfucknowhere on a school night
And most sports dont run that late minus meets
No matter how you do it its gonna run late
there's no less extreme option is my point
A football team is hard to assemble
Well that's still their choice
"hi, that sport you really love? sacrifice your sleep and education for it yeah thanks bye"
in their defense, that's an unfair decision
That's their choice to do that though
true
yeah, if your athletes are getting home at 10PM, you're doing something wrong
also yeah the money they spend on it isn't really justifiable
(also athletes leaving classes early for games)
Like damn 1 assembly aint much
(also fund band totally not biased)
uh, hell yeah. pay teachers please.
football field? well, ok, i guess you gotta play football somewhere, and if you can afford to have your own, sure. 11 million dollars on bleachers to glorify the team? i feel like you crossed the line somewhere in there.
Does it detract though?
i'd like it better if sports were treated more like competitive clubs that received enough subsidization to make it available to students but not too much to detract from other shit
Tennis is expensive af
Well yes but if the school didnt offer it I wouldn't have done it
no, jarrett. you can do sports outside of school. it doesn't need to be linked to a school.
Just like any other extra curricular activity
that's why it's tied to academia. it's stupid-ass reason, but that's kinda why
You're driven in some way
Cause it shows you did something
sports are great for fun or exercise or team building
lot of good stuff about sports
But why is it tied to _academia_
"hello 18 year old who's desperate to play professionally! why don't you sign with this professional team who actually can't accurately measure your talent and therefore can't give you any indication of your future success? and since we can literally ask any other high school student, we'll just exploit you and pay you very little to give up a college education for this opportunity because fuck you! you just feed into our team, and we'll inevitably cast you out for someone who will eventually prove to be more talented once you both start physically developing more, leaving you with no job or college education at age 22. do you wanna sign or give up on your dreams?"
But sports yes
oh no i'm not saying sports are a bad thing
Stadium no
I thinks sports are generally a good thing
For me it was tennis for some its football
Glad it was avaliable
I liked it
I really appreciated the sports at least the tennis side
Okay y'all
why do all colleges need to have a football team and a lacrosse team and a basketball team and idk
competitive synchronized ping pong team
sure but why are college sports a thing
idk
because colleges do sports and a lot of high schools try to emulate colleges?
you'd think those two things are unrelated
i have no clue how sports got so tied in with academics
fuck that
but like
which makes sense if you think about it
sports are only valued cuz it's the only thing admin can take interest in while at work
^^^^^^^
fuck school spirit sorry not sorry
hennig was better than donna at least
except paananen
fuck skyline's admin
i'm generally thankful for the education i got. I've had some p amazing teachers who deserve more than what they got paid for teaching my stupid ass
I don't appreciate the "spORTS ARE IMPORTANT FOR  S C H O O L  S P I R I T"
I feel like my family issues were/are inherently tied to school bc my gpa was/is always used as an excuse to shit on me
i'm sorry
oh, mb. i thought we meant skyline specifically
family issues NOT pertaining to school
cough
wdym?
i think most of my trouble came from non-school factors
i know many people do have their issues with it
i myself did not have many issues with it
i appreciate the education
if that ain't the fattest mood
i only had to scar myself for life with ib diploma to get that education, but that's no biggy
ok, true. i still think we received a solid education. i will give credit where credit is due.
lol fuck skyline
however,
I'm v thankful for my education
fOoTbAlL
realistically
we're a solid school but we're not amazing
and that's exactly why it sucks a lot of the time
"good schools"
like yes i KNOW
my dad goes "But it's such a good school!"
I complain about skyline
EVERY TIME
there's fucking nothing here but good schools (which are still hell)
ok true
true though
lol
as noah put it, the only reason you'd move to sammamish is to raise a family
it is
i dunno man
is it
anyways, moving out of sammamish should be refreshing because people having kids eventually will be less of a norm/expectation in big cities
although in umpire talk that translates to "coach, balls and strikes are a judgement call and cannot be reversed"
"bro, calm down. you and i both know that you work a 9-5 job and come here in the evening to volunteer for your son/daughter's team in your spare time. this doesn't mean jackshit to you, and we both know it. i'm just doing my job. if i turn the call in you favor, i'll be having this exact conversation with the other coach. let's just fucking play the game already cuz i haven't eaten dinner yet."
ah good times
umpiring was pretty much the opposite for me. the parents were the one who were doing the screaming.
having candy by the registers prob doesn't help the screaming kids
yea
damn
michaels frames are overpriced
not really, it was like 3 or 4 big frames
lmao jkjk
tbf, that is a lot of frames
one little boy's dad was buying like $200 of frames from michaels and the kid was screaming like "You spent that much on _frames_ and I didn't get _anything"_
lmao
again, it's a shit ton of responsibility
idk most of my experiences with kids are watching them scream when their parents refuse to get them anything from the store
but really, like, i'll babysit someone else's kid for a day and that's kinda my limit
kids are easier to make laugh
instills respect in the smol one's hearts
i think it's the giraffe vibes
i'm weirdly good with kids
rip
i'm supposedly good with kids and like the olderish ones (like, if you're old enough to hold a conversation and not shit your pants, then congrats, i like you. if you're still a kid, you're probably an asshole but cute), but i feel like the notion that i'm "good with kids" is something other people say cuz they have low as fuck standards. nor do i feel like i'd ever want that kind of commitment.
yeah i'd need lots of therapy and parenting books before i felt almost ready to raise a kid
for basically the same reasons
I'd be terrified of parenthood if I actually wanted it
like what if my kid resents me for the same reasons i hate my parents
idk i'd be afraid of raising a kid because wow those things are easy to fuck up
and it's not like i have amazing parents to use as examples of model parenthood
feed the bitter
hey, it's ok. don't worry about it
I totally lied about being done with being bitter even for the night lmao
ok, that came off wrong out of context
there's a fuck ton of chinese people in the world as is
it's funny bc they acknowledge that they moved here to escape china
shoulda thought about that before you moved to the US
there are thousands of other ways to do that
but like
i mean i get that bc they want to make sure ~their culture is preserved~
"if you don't have a baby you're a failure" is p yike
that sounds p Handmaid's Tale-esque
they gave susan a lot of shit too when she was dating her korean bf too
angers me a lot
that
i think my parents are miffed that none of the guys i've dated are chinese
thanks mother
also "if you don't bring life into this world you're a failure of a woman"
ooooo bloodline. so important. /s
oh I absolutely have
you haven't been told that one line? "You'll change your mind when you grow up"?
I think my mom is just in denial about neither of us wanting kids/our dysfunctional bloodline ending here
What does that mean?
hi thanks i would like disrespecting humanity for 800 please
wait what?
yeah, that crosses the line of being rude and just goes straight into insanity territory
That's kinda fucked
what the ever living flipping fuck
w a c k
wtf
to which i was like
like the one comment that just keeps bothering me is my mom saying that  "you know that this (my relationship w Noah) is just for fun right? you need to find an actually healthy person to be with when you get married"
rude
well that's just
they've made snippy comments about noah so fucking much that i'm just done at this point
i really fucking hate how they just disrespect other people
i'm ngl
also
i'm really sorry, guys. y'all are wonderful people and never deserved any of this bullshit.
and i just don't get it
and save money but like that's his main reason
idk
David has a well paying job and he probably could move out whenever he feels like it but he still lives with us because he wants to "rebuild his relationship with our parents"
i don't want to have to mediate fights or stand behind my mom's car as she tries to drive off in a crying rage
don't feel like dealing with this bullshit anymore
but as time goes on i just
my dad less so than my mom
i have problems with both of my parents
oof
but i still kinda resent my mom for picking my dad
i mean me too but with my dad
which is why I'm singling her out a lot more
also I know I've said this before but my problems w my parents are 90% with my mom
gah
that's your cop out
my mom always says I think I know everything WHILE HAVING THAT EXACT ATTITUDE HERSELF
i'm really sorry
"i'm the parent and you aren't"
but i'm so tired of hearing the line
like i'm sorry
idc if that's petty or immature I just don't see them realizing their mistakes and trying to atone for them and i'm not into banging my head into the brick wall that is their stupidity over and over again
same Salina
they're just like this is the people we are and it's just gonna stay that way
but it's also a matter of they're not willing to make changes
I get that they're "not perfect people" and that they're human too and that they've made mistakes. I get where a lot of those mistakes and stuff come from given cultural and family context. It still pisses me off
I don't really have any interest in letting go of my bitterness towards my parents
i've let way too much slide
it's not a matter of letting go of shit
my brother spent a long time trying to teach me how to let go of shit my parents say/do, and i'm still pretty mediocre at best, so i feel y'all
i would do that if i can but if i'd stick around if i couldn't support myself
I might go minimal contact
I keep trying but I don't think I'm ever really gonna be free of the resentment
i just really can't stand them
i'm most likely going no contact with my parents after undergrad
ok mood
i don't think i'll ever be done being bitter
i'm sorry
truthfully
aight I'm done being bitter for tonight lol
sigh
basically what gene said
"i don't want you to need me for anything" and then realized it meant you'd be more independent later on
sounds more like "i want you to be x except for when it's convenient for me"
or didn't think through what she wanted
that just sounds like she can't make up her mind
it's wack
you were never "sweet" to us growing up, why do you expect us to be "sweet" to you now?
she's literally just mad that we grew into girls who are headstrong and self-confident and independent and free-thinking enough to ignore her "obedience" bullshit
r i p
bitch what did you expect???????????/
and I'm just like
ok Im sorry to keep ramble-ranting but another thing that really bothers me is that my parents like specifically tried to raise us to be more Tough and Masculine (hence crying=weakness thing, also my mom hated buying me girly stuff when I was little, it was mostly my dad indulging me w barbies n shit) but now my mom always complains that we're not "sweet" or "ladylike" enough
my dad went to china for a couple weeks when my grandpa died and my grandma but i stayed home
yeah same
haven't been to any funerals either. my grandfather passed away not too long ago, but he was kinda in china so yeah lol
my parents definitely hit me with "boys don't cry" a lot, and i can't think of a falser statement
i feel that
Haven't been to any funerals though
literally the only exceptions I can remember have been funerals lmao
i'm really sorry. i feel that.
from when I was really young whenever I cry in front of her she tells me to shut up and stop looking for sympathy/stop acting weak
not to blame all my neuroses on her bc they're not all her fault but like
I feel like this is another thing that got hammered into my head by my mom tbh
it was something i had to get used to and learn to be comfortable with, but i think it boils down to being a trust thing, which is why matheny sees a shit ton of her students cry at some point in time
i feel awkward looking them in the face after crying in front of them
i don't like it but honestly sometimes you just need to let it happen
same
i highkey hate crying in front of anyone
looking back, i think there were more teachers i cried in front than those i didn't once i reached ib. mostly cuz i cry a bit too much/too openly
I guess on-level kids got that?? idk really
lol
ok big facts
we're all still waiting for that part of senior year where we were promised we could slack off
i cried in front of matheny an embarrassing amount
tbh i think a lot of us had a shit 2nd semester
I'm chill now, I had kind of a rough 2nd semester this year
aw cindy. i'm so sorry
that sounds awful
i'm so sorry, cindy
i understand the challenges of the immigrant experience, but i feel like it defeats the purpose of the immigrant story version of the "american dream" (which is bullshit but tends to be a lot of parents' frame of reference) in pushing your kids to be miserable when you already worked so hard to immigrate so that they wouldn't be
oof
and I was just like ".........................thanks" and cried a lot after they finally left me alone lol
he basically was like "I never thought you would be like this because you've always been a super strong girl"
which was kinda sweet but really just highlighted how little they understand about mental health
my dad tried to have a well-intentioned but horribly misplaced conversation about depression w me
"people with depression don't say that they're depressed. anyone who claims to have depression is just seeking attention"
like my mom yelled at me for missing class lol
i feel like the difficulties of the immigrant experience of the "we faced challenges so deal with your silver spoon" honestly is really detrimental
my parents found out I was seeing a mental health counselor (privately, and they found out by opening a letter addressed to me with "CONFIDENTIAL" stamped on it in red) and absolutely flipped their shit
slow clap
it's all made up
it's not a real problem
mental problems are all in your own head
and my dad was straight up like
i talked to my parents about mental health
regardless, no one deserves to be fucked over by their parents in the way that's depressingly common. i think the fact that it's so common is almost detrimental in that it numbs people to their experiences because it seems more normal. in reality, any one person's experiences are still important, and it's really disappointing how both asian immigrant parents and first generation/second generation (depends on your pov) asian americans both just accept terrible parent-child relationships as the norm
i have long-ass discussion about this with my parents. they fucked up my brother's upbringing pretty hard and have since improved (my brother joked to me that our parents "raised you like a white boy," which i mostly disagree with but distracts from the point). they've been in the states longer than most asian parents we see by virtue of the fact that i was born 13 years after my parents, so they're rather self-aware because they have a decade more of parenting experience and adjusting to the US
which reeks of hypocrisy
my parents always pull the we don't have that many standards, we just expect obedience card
among other things
immigrant mentality, lack of awareness of american childhood/teen life, and cultural misunderstandings
do you know why?
it's actually depressing
like 98% of the asian american kids I have ever known have been fucked in some way by their upbringing
and rubbing it in my face all the time is kinda infuriating
we have like a collective therapy session about all our parent issues like every few weeks lmao
but also threatening to just randomly cut me off for really stupid shit is also just... stupid?
i mean yes parents are great and do a lot
it's rant about parents central here
nah you're good
sorry for hijacking the plane
technically everything they do for you is a favor?
anyhow
chill
that's so patronizing
but also like wow
technically "true" i guess?
which is like
"you're 18 now everything we do for you is just a favor"
also they're like
my mom is convinced I'm gonna crash and burn
esp since I'm literally in the same boat
cuz everybody loves a helicopter parent
wow we don't trust you to fucking function on your own and are just waiting for you to fuck up passive aggressive borderline threat-y kind of help
ok I shouldn't make jokes about this lmao
~~cockblocking?~~
it's more of the
but it's not like the wholesome kind of nice help
"OFC IF YOU EVER NEED HELP WE'LL HELP YOU"
it's more like
which is why if they'd want to visit, they'd give you a phone call beforehand, so it'll either be easier to make an excuse or at least let you prepare beforehand
is it like
"oh we're gonna surprise visit you!"
honest to god i just don't understand my parents that much rn
and like legit that's scary
UW is a big campus
0.0
if it helps, they would need to ask you beforehand since they can't get into the building without asking you
but it's still a possibility that idk how to address
I had to threaten my mom into saying she wouldn't
my mom when unhinged is like scary and has no sense of boundaries
but like
they said they won't
AND I'M MOVING TO ANOTHER COUNTRY
i just don't put it past them
DUDE SAME
i'm scared my parents will like pop up randomly
highkey
UW's gonna feel a whole lot further from sammamish than we think it is once we're there
lmao no i'm probably messier than you
gimme an a for effort lol
i even bought a makeup organizer to figure out how to be less of a hot mess roommate
i fucking hope so
and yea, Salina you've gotta be a hell of a better roommate than my dad
he was like certain i was going there before i committed and the rest of my college acceptances were in
(you're rooming w me!)
my dad is fucking over the moon about me going to UW
love you <3 things will get better
i'm sorry that that's how you feel jane
but that's besides the point
lots of mixed messages
i can't tell if my parents are glad or mad that i'm at uw
yeah my parents were 90% of the reason I didn't want to go to UW
you don't deserve this kinda of bullshit
i can't blame you at all
this is like 90% of the reason i wanted to go to an out of state college
sending my love
hang in there jane
^same
i deal with my fair share of this kind of bullshit and i wouldn't wish it on anyone
i'm sorry
yeah it sounds rough
i'm really sorry you have to deal with this
no
i guess they're not mutually exclusive
i mean I don't think any of those are wrong
or just zero self-awareness
he honestly just sounds like he wants to throw a fit either for the hell of it or because he dislikes being wrong, and he doesn't understand how to respond to being wrong in a polite conversation
and he tells me off for banging ice cube trays on the table
smh
that's rough to say the least
rip
and my first thought was like "did he crack the table"
..... oof
one time i was ranting about how i hated the people in my stats class and then he made an underhanded joke about my sister being in classes with stupid people (she's not doing IB next year and he's HELLA salty about it), then steamrolled over me trying to tell him otherwise and tried to talk about something with my brother
So i went "DAD"
And he like slammed his hand down on the table and starting screaming about how he was trying to talk to my brother about something and how i was so rude trying to talk over him
oh yea
he must be really fucking loud
i'm really sorry
that sound, uh, concerning to say the least
holy shit
oof
I've been told by my neighbors that you can hear my dad yelling from outside
Unless my dad is yelling at him the only benefit he gets is more quiet in the house
He just makes his point
My brother doesn't think that my dad is sexist and/or anything else that would cause him to think of my brother as more reasonable than anyone else
does he leverage things to his own advantage or does he fuck with the situation for the sake of making an unnecessary point?
ah
No he says things to sway it in the direction he thinks is right
"i am well aware i am the only person who can prevent person x from unjustly getting mad with person y, both of whom are family, but i instead choose not to acknowledge this so i am not obligated to act during these situations"
yeah, that's honestly even more concerning
and yeah that's p shit
idk
he might see it but not want to admit it
i honestly really don't envy that situation
i still find it really weird that even your brother doesn't see that, cuz that sounds like it'd make it even more frustrating
i'm really sorry about that. that's honestly wack as fuck
though neither he nor my dad will admit that
because my mom gets yelled at more than anyone else and my brother is kind of hit or miss on whose side he's on. Though my brother is usually the only person that my dad kinda listens to
i feel bad leaving my sister behind
but yeah that sucks. tbh it's not worth arguing a lot of the time (I don't take my own advice though so.) and it is unfair and annoying. I'm sure you recognize that you didn't do shit in these kinds of situations though. it's frustrating but hey, you won't have to deal with it as often or at least as up-close for much longer
ok first off I 100% feel
aw jane
like he's so hypocritical and stupid that his arguments never make any sense that it's legitimately difficult to remember what i was originally arguing with him about because he goes on so many weird tangents and has so many leaps in logic
that sounds like a pain to deal with tbh
oof
i am so sorry
no he like actually doesn't make any sense half the time
that
hol' up what the hell
and he responds "If you had questions you should've asked them at the lecture!!!!!"
and i went "Do you even know what my reading speed is?"
and I was like "oh that's not a problem"
and so he got pissy
and in the car ride home my dad was like
"You know what you have to study now right? Reading faster"
one time i went to a lecture at the library on whether to take the ACT or the SAT and the woman lecturing said that we should focus on getting our reading speed up and in my head i was like "oh np, i read pretty fast"
feel free to rant
this is like not the stupidest thing they've been mad about
im sorry to hear that that happened to you
that's p bullshit and petty ngl. they're pretty clearly just looking for an excuse to be upset at that point
where it doesn't matter what situation I'm in if they call me I better pick up or I'll have hell waiting for me when I get back
my mom is kinda like that too
why the hell would they just randomly expect you to pick up? bluetooth is something that you actually have to set up beforehand and takes time and effort
my parents are just full of bullshit
I'm sorry
yeah that's some bullshit
second of all i never connect my phone to the car because i don't listen to music when i drive and it just takes unnecessary amounts of timee and effort for the OFF CHANCE someone will call me or text me
ignoring the fact that when my dad was teaching me how to drive he literally wouldn't let me talk to people *sitting in the car with me* because I "need to keep focused"
and the car will read out text messages to me
and my parents both demanded that i answer phone calls ***AND*** text messages because *the car HAS BLUETOOTH*
oh lord
and thne i got inside
so i ignored it because i was driving and i was literally almost home anyway
and my mom called me because she thought i should've been at home by then
in the dark
i was driving home
30 seconds away from ariving at home
i was literally
do you wanna talk about it?
you ok?
I am angery
I'm in this picture, and I don't like it
I just realized that school has made me accustomed to doing jack shit during the day and only being productive in the evening
Fleeeeex
Hahahah
They're usually super full of themselves so it feels good to put them down a notch so to speak without actually hurting anyone
Haha thanks
Also, we're all super proud of you, so it balances out
Well, that's good then
Ripperoni
The last time I talked to my cousin was almost 5 years ago
Oh lmao
No I don't care at all lol
Still, I'm sorry to hear though
I knew the marriage gifts was a thing, but that was more than I expected
It's a nice and pretty big apartment
That's p crazy. I didn't realize it was that intense
Holy shit
This is normal
For example my cousin got a whole house and car from her parents in law when they got married
Now you can have an extra ramen packet for dinner during September
Family gets really involved in everything in china
Family is supposed to give you cash gifts for getting into college
Like, culturally or like a family thing? Cuz I've never heard of this
Wait, is that a tradition?
We didn't give them presents when they got into college which is a Chinese tradition so I understand if they're a bit bitter even if they asked for a lot from my mom
That's p wack. You'd think they'd be happy for you
Oh, I'm sorry to hear about that
Well they're also jealous I got into Duke but that's precisely the reason they don't talk about me
That's what they want you to think
Right now it's just pictures of my cousin's new baby
Lol
That just means there's tea about you going around
Lmao my mom's family had a WeChat group but my mom stubbornly refused to add me into it
I'm reaching cringe levels that shouldn't even be possible during this conversation
Also <@173668455856340994> ok, you have a point
So damn good hahaha
Those make me uncomfortable
Do you guys know the Tom Cruise clinging memes?
Facebook memes are really something
I dunno
WeChat memes are somehow below Facebook memes in my book
Ah
Not quite what I mean
Yes
Does anyone else's parents attempt to show them WeChat memes?
They can actually communicate in that language
But like
The fun time when you are more literate than your friend
I did too
My mom and dad got it though
No my aunt and grandma didn't know what I meant haha
Not well at least
LMAO
Can chinese be read like that?
Side question
I like to imagine that's your dad apologizing for you
And they even sent audio files too
Got the perfect profile picture too
That's the biggest mood I've ever seen
<@173668455856340994>
HAHAHA I LOVE THAT
So these were my first words
But I can't read or write Chinese
Oh no
Recently I got added to my family's WeChat because my mom forced me to make a WeChat
Tea
*you are still the superior youtuber*
*do not bow down*
*no*

<:AW:605634857317695518>

Emily if you see a person called Chaiberry commenting on your videos
It was in the youtube video
Yeah, you should ask her
To be fair
Oh, shit, uh
College results
What's the context?
Should summon Emily to find out
Still wondering if that one is rude

Yay!
Although it's hard to get a response out of her ngl lol
i'm almost silver again in ow!
Uhm, let's ask Helen in the morning I guess and talk about something else for now
Asian parties fuuunnnn
Big brain economics
I'm okay with Saturday
some of which i now need to return lol
so i traded my time for some goods
I see
but i really wanted to buy some stuff from tj maxx
i usually do
I just dodge the Asian parties nowadays
woo entertain the masses
Ooferoni
i have an asian party circuit to go on
nope
Does that still work for you guys <@340319804747415553> <@233062637922025472>?
Idk ask her when she's alive
... Saturday night?
Uhm
Reeee
She's usually technically free on weekday evenings but too drained to be social
Even in the evening/night?
microsoft stops for no one
Oh
Cuz this weekend might be our last chance to see her
prob not
Ok, what I'm curious about is if Helen is available
Yeah, Cindy's taking a one-week trip
i should have time
Y'all have fun though!!
Out of town
I'm
Are you guys free Friday?
We should just have a tabletop game day
Me too!
Aw yiss
Hell yes
Also Gene
I do have to be up kinda early but that's never stopped me from being up till 4 before lol
i don't care
i know
shrug
Yeah this is the Real Reason I left early Salina don't come at me
Y'all wanna get together and play Secret Hitler sometime?
Hi
HELLO
My phone lost connection for a sec was all
hi
lol
Lmao
I like how you said that and the conversation died
HI
<@233062637922025472> we gonna have a CONVERSATION
Yeah, I'm dming him
Rip huge-ass trees
Oh is he alive
<@233062637922025472> get over here
Also I'm lowkey bitter bc the window in my room faces north but there's a huge ass tree in the way
I'm sorry you can't drive tho :/
I'm still up for a bit
Sure thing
Man this would've been so much easier if I could drive without waking my parents
I'm probably gonna keep spam texting bc it makes me feel slightly better about trudging up 228th at 1 am
Damn lol
Lmao
As long as you're sure you're comfortable
i dug out my actual compass for this shit let's fucking go
Stay safe
Well, alright
Basically you're supposed to try to get an unobstructed view of the northern horizon
Visibility hard to predict and I couldn't find any late night live updates lol
Yes, not sure if visible from here
I'm not sure if it freaks me out more when the lights in peoples houses are on or off
Are you sure there are nothern lights right now?
Idk why but I'm a lot more tense than usual I've taken a lot of probably ill-advised middle of the night excursions
Oof, I mean, alright. Stay safe and be careful
So I feel a little like I'm asking to get murdered but I'm taking a walk to try to maybe catch the northern lights
I agree with what Cindy has to say. Just wanted point out another thing:
The El Paso shooting was almost certainly driven by white supremecy (the shooter was spouting some pretty racist shit). But per my knoeledge, there's still no known motive for the Dayton shooting. The shooter's sister was apparently killed, and that doesn't feel like a coincidence, but there's still no confirmation on if that was a connection. I usually don't care much for the motive when something this tragic happens, but I felt like it was worth mentioning at least this time since Trump's said some bullshit about it.  In summary: he surprisingly acknowledged racism as being problematic, but it felt really toned down to me and like he was drawing attention for. If I recall correctly, he was hesitant to call for any gun reform and listed poor focus on mental health and violent video games (which, I can't believe I'm still seeing people directing blame at the latter in 2019, but it's fucking Trump, I guess), which are pretty much cop-out excuses for not taking action.
Tl;dr: Just wanted to point out the info on the motives thus far cuz people like Trump are being bitches about it this time around. However, it's pretty clear that the shooters are wackos and that gun control is the fastest solution. Everything Cindy said is correct: voting and calling people in gov is probably the best we can do since a lot of people are lazy asses.
call and write your legislators, local and national, vote when you can, volunteer if you're interested and willing. unfortunately you're right that the government probably isn't gonna do anything about it anytime soon despite 60% of americans supporting increased gun control
And we don't really know exactly why people do it because they often aren't taken alive and we can't really ask them when they're dead
Like I don't see the government doing anything about it anytime soon
What can we do about it tho
source: https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/08/05/743579605/how-the-u-s-compares-to-other-countries-in-deaths-from-gun-violence
"One more way to consider these data: The institute also estimates what it would expect a country's rate of gun violence deaths to be based solely on its socioeconomic status. By that measure, the U.S. should be seeing only 0.46 deaths per 100,000 people. (That is comparable to the rate in Canada, where the statistic is 0.47 deaths per 100,000.)

Instead, the actual U.S. rate of 4.43 deaths per 100,000 is almost 10 times as high."
22 dead in el paso shooting
Well, this is p fucked up
bruh this is hella depressing
Lol thx
Congrats tho!
I'm finally getting a curtain rod to make my room look semi decent today and I'm leaving in two weeks
I've lacked significant motivation to wake up in the morning since like sophomore or junior year
Idk how I'm gonna get out of bed in college
The Rs could have sharper angles
Like the Os could connect more towards the middle
That's fancy shmancy cursive
No no
That's just a cursive thing. Not their fault.
Same with the Rs
In all fairness that O is kinda weird
Y'all look adorable
That's really cute though
I suck at reading cursive, so I initially read that as "Thanks for all your hand wank" and got really confused and concerned
I honestly have no idea lmao
Good question
That's adorable
Also wait I just realized that's cartoon y'all
I'm down but it's up to you
Like what
Since you said you wanted to drive
<@!503787499605458954> wanna do something today
I had a 7 am meeting this morning
Yeah
You're home already?
Aw that's a cute drawing
I’m unemployed again
Well folks
been there done that
Montana
Oh lmao
where in spanish
Donde?
donde
but like
ok now I have a weird urge to drive somewhere
and seeing as self improvement is hard I generally just stay up and try and work on stuff
either I can go to sleep at a normal time and try to fix my sleep schedule, or I can just stay up late and try to be productive then
that's how I always view it when I get up late
that's the spirit
well you got all night to be productive then
and I didn't get out of bed today until like almost noon
I mean I'm not sleepy I just feel like doing nothing
like a bed
have you tired lying on something else
I am lmao I was supposed to go hiking today and instead I'm lying on the floor
Until then, take it easy on yourself
Well, it'll pass. Just give it some time.
so idk what's up
and I've been sleeping a lot more than normal too
it's not like tragic or anything it's just weird
Be sure to get some rest when you can
i had one the other day and it tastes... weird
Awww im sorry
i agree with <@!472541429130854421> about diet coke
also
L
idk why but I've had like zero energy these past 2 days
Maybe bitter isn't the most precise descriptor, it just tastes less sweet and more savory if that makes sense
No
*cherry coke?*
Zero has more phosphoric acid
hm not sure where the bitter is coming from then
Aspartame
No it's not stevia
it's a lot sweeter than sugar but has a bit of a bitter aftertaste that some people really dislike
it's a zero calorie sweetener, comes from the stevia plant
Vanilla Coke is good
Stevia is a sweetener
Vanilla Coke and Cherry Coke are nice for cheap sodas. Haven't tried the zero/diet variations
What is stevia?
Diet Coke tastes empty
Mexican Coke is way better than normal coke, but there are better cane sugar colas out there
Regular coke is sweet
does it have stevia in it
Zero has a slightly bitter tangy taste that I like
For a cheap canned soda, Sprite is pretty inoffensive.
mexican coke is its own thing
they feel lighter and less sticky bc there's no corn syrup but that's about it
honestly I don't even think either of them are that different from regular coke
ah
Because they changed the proportions of the two sweeteners
really? I've never noticed, but I've never drank them side by side lmao
They do taste a little different
I don't understand why
Yeah
they're just marketed differently
diet coke/coke zero are literally the same
You know what I'm getting one right now
Same
one can is like 40g sugar
I haven't had real coke in a long ass time
Not the bougie glass real sugar ones
Alright what's your recommendation among canned cheap sodas
No
I can't for the life of me understand why they have both options
Is diet Coke better?
It just tastes really sus
Almost anything else
What's better?
Just the taste
Why?
Coke zero nast don't @ me
I'm drinking too much coke zero
Put a bag on it and pray
Do waterproof TVs exist?
I'm okay with that
You're gonna need a whole TV in there if you wanna stay 5 feet apart
Don't fall and become the next dorm casualty
5 feet apart
Just 2 bros in a shower
Hey
<@233062637922025472> how does this make you feel?
My roomate can join me in the shower if he wants
It can foster infections
Contacts in shower are ill advised on a long term basis
You're going to piss off your roommate
yes contacts work
Cant be holding my phone to my face for 2.5 hours
Do contacts work in the shower?
Also
My plan is not what youre thinking of
I'm the blood god here
all in a day's work
blood for the blood god
I didn't realize you wanted him dead that badly
power bank in same bag
Definitely don't try charging the phone
That sounds unsafe
*what's your plan* here
Gonna watch a whole ass movie in the shower

I'm psyched for college when I get infinite hot water
<@472541429130854421> ok, that's more of a case not showering frequently enough rather than not showering long enough
Scuze me y'all
Which like, sometimes I'm there, but others I'm oof
I have done 30 on true sadboi days. My ideal shower is like 10 minutes.
I spend about 15 minutes but I shower twice a week at most
just don't be noah and chill in the shower for like 40 mins
i usually take 10-15 min showers
lol rip
At least not being in there for long enough isn't nearly as wasteful as what I'm doing
Wbu?
It's like twice as long as I should be in there lol. Maybe more.
20 minutes on a bad day? I have no sense of time though
I don't keep track of time. That's the point of a depression shower
How much time are you spending in showers?
At least it's change
We'll both just acquire new problems
Wanna trade?
I've been spending too little time in showers
I'm spending way too much time in the shower these days cuz I'm used to the IB depression showers, but now they're just my normal shower, and it's honestly kinda concerning
I'll go actually try now. I'm getting kinda tired of staring into an abyss and thinking about shit anyways. G'night y'all. Get some rest as well if you can.
Thanks

I know I know
hmm yea maybe
But since when did I have any sense of discipline
Which wasn't the smartest idea in hindsight
I've been shooting beams of information into my face to get me through sad boi hours
sleeping in light is also ok
false
Thank you for this insightful advice
Dark mode isnt good enough
Sleep is best in the dark
Whoopsy
you're not wrong tho
Wow that was a little agressive sounding
Yeah, I guess
I would get the hell off my phone as a step one to sleep Gene
Idk
I can't fall asleep
<@!258094439636008971>
i thought you were going to sleep
bruh
Time to contemplate what the hell happened to the last 7 weeks of our lives
Whoa it's the last day of july
That night, the rain tapped sharply on the window, leaving little beads of rainwater to glisten in the warm glow of the candlelight that radiated from within. The old woodwork of the humble cabin, tired from its years of age, caused the floorboards to creak as I, with a book in hand, took the last (and only) seat at the dinner table. The light from the candle danced in its place, casting its luminescence dimly throughout the rest of the room just well enough that one could make out the pale silhouette of the logs that, when stacked upon each other, made up the walls that stretched only a few more meters higher than one could reach.
(to clarify, I'm gonna be up another hour or two but can't call anymore since my mom needs to think I'm asleep, but in reality, I probably just won't be able to fall asleep since I got out of bed at 3:30 lol)
Everyone: Signing off and going to bed between 11 and 12
Me, knowing full well I haven't slept before 1 all summer: What's wrong with everyone? What are we? Adults??
L
I'm also only semi-conscious because I feel asleep and just woke back up again
This summer has kinda been my chance to do the things I never could do the past 12 years, but the more I look at it, this is the shit I wanted when I was 12, not necessarily now. It's a nice life, but my ass needs to be productive to not feel guilty.
Maybe I should get out of the house if I need to get work done so I'm less distracted and can feel productive
L
My spirit animal is now a potato
I don't feel like the same person who managed to overcome IB just a little while back
It's ok I'm just a weakass when I oversleep
aw i'm sorry
I simultaneously want to be left alone and want a hug
I'm confused and tired
My shoulder is pain
how u doing
aw
I'm having potato boi hours over here
I'm sorry
Damn, that's wack af
i'm a lil annoyed i need to buy them separately but also oh well
#problems
basically i can't buy a set bc my top half is a size small and my legs are a size large
What happened.
that fucking awkward moment when you try to buy a scrub set but your legs fuck up the dream of spending less money
❤
Thanks so much guys ❤️
rip
Anyways. Like Gene said, you're not alone, and like Salina said, you're still gorgeous. (I know body image isn't at stake as much as health, but still). Best of luck in college. I trust that you'll find a way to break the cycle
I know I'm late to this since I just got home but almost everything you said was v v relatable, I'm just not currently working in an office and like cooking a lot so I do have a bit more control over that
I love food sm but sometimes I feel like it's an abusive relationship lmao
Any time
No worries. You know yourself better than I do. I don't want to make it seem otherwise.
and thanks for listening
no it wasn't unwelcome, it's just that those things won't work for me. i wish i could use them though
We're always here to listen, even if you don't want advice. Didn't mean to force it onto you though.
No worries.
i really appreciate that
thanks
I'm sorry. Simply put, I don't want you to feel like you're alone in this while you're struggling though.
unless college proves to be a huge positive change which it very well could be
this is probably something that will stay with me for many years
you guys don't have to give me advice you know
idk, there isn't an easy psychological trick that can change anything for me
Are there any other non-sugary foods you enjoy? Maybe you'll be less tempted to eat sugar in front of you if you've already eaten or have other food available?
oof
for my mom it was reaching 180 lbs and she still has much better self control than me
i've had the opposite problem
thas a real rip
ah
it might take a traumatic event like getting real diabetes to change how i react to food
i've tried the being mindful thing, which is honestly the only real solution I can use, but it has also failed spectacularly so far
I'm sorry :/
ah
yeah it's pretty much compulsive
Like you just kinda grab it without thinking
you don't have to come up with a solution for me, i feel like there isn't some trick or nifty answer i can get in words
Is it like a compulsive thing
Ah
and in college, every single meal card swipe of every day
right now, work related events, and free food laid out in the office left over from an event
What kinds of events?
usually the sugar comes as a form of free food like at an event lol
Again, I'm saying replace rather than add
But at the same time, it has a different taste, so that could help you move away from other sugary things
Which is why I say honey's not a permanent solution
Well, when it comes to free food, you could just follow the discount rule: you're still paying more [calories] than you have to unless you were looking for [food] before it was offered/came to your attention
also science says your body processes honey the same way as normal sugar
no if i intentionally add something unhealthy that will only increase the amount of it i eat since i eat everything in front of me
it's also super hard for me to resist free food which will unfortunately be common for the rest of my life
Maybe start incorporating those into your diet instead. It's not a permanent solution by any means, but it's a start
yeah everything if it's available
What about things like maple syrup, honey, and fruit?
sweet things like cake, ice cream, candy
Is it a craving for sweet things in general or sugar?
i do that much more than is healthy and that's the kind of situation i think i should start eliminating but it's also the hardest
think a full cup of hard candy
that happens to me when i have a truly gargantuan amount of pure sugar
I will be fine one second and then like wow where’d my will to live go
My blood sugar gets very fucky sometimes I think
Ah
sometimes i get sugar crashes though
which is kind of a problem too because i can't feel the physical negative effects of sugar to make that a deterrent
Can’t say the same honestly
200 lb guys get stomachaches from sugar before i do
lol
my stomach is a god at processing sugar
Basically your sugar processing is a little fucky but not completely fucked yet
I’ll probably get screened when I’m older
what does prediabetic really mean?
My sister and I think we’re probably prediabetic but that’s because of grandma getting diabetes at the end of life
how long do you have to eat badly to become prediabetic?
there's a history of strokes in my family from the maternal side
my grandma loves salt and she has terrible cholesterol
no history of diabetes since i'm the only person who likes sweet things
Ah rip
probably not yet but i could be soon if i don't get my shit together
Is there any history of diabetes in your family
Have you thought you might be prediabetic
i've done that before
like straight sugar
Ah
mostly sugar
Bad stuff being...
it's more about being able to resist the bad stuff
for me it's not a matter of lazy convenience like walking out to get good food instead of ramen cups all day
i feel like my health has only been alright because my mom loves making healthy food, but i will have to make an effort to do that from now on
starting in just three weeks the rest of my life is going to be very different and i'm afraid of what that might mean, health wise
lol
Jokes aside
Still got into duke amirite
I’m sorry
i think i've always had trouble turning some of my goals into reality
thanks, that means a lot
You’re beautiful and I hope you do feel better in the future
Aw I’m sorry
doesn't make me feel better tho
yeah maybe it's a bit inaccurate
But I’m like 90% sure I’m still slightly underweight
It said I’m the right weight
Especially jiayi
Personally I dont think anybody here needs to lose that much
And even with that 20 lbs is a lot
So I dont think that thing is even close to reliable
Thing said im overweight
Oh yeah <@472541429130854421> I looked at that bmi calculator
Y. E. S.

Something about the cats movie
The rawr dance
😠
Ah, yes
Rawrddance
Good
I never used it
Good riddance
oh yeah rawr is something thjat kinda disappeared
what the fuck
<@470822754262712329> tell him off
Rofl wow guys
Rawr XD lol
XD lol
<@478706068223164416> yes
It's easier to pick up interest in offense first since individual pitches are harder to appreciate at first
did you fucking @ me to tell me about an XD
I mean, I guess that's valid
Or a humans vs ai kinda thing
Lemme see if there are any Mariners vs Rays games coming up in Seattle
And more like golf
But I'm starting to appreciate the sport more by viewing it less as a two team sport
Still figuring out some of the intricacies of the game
Well
Btw, how's bandwagoning the Rays going for you?
You missed a good game tbh
But some other stuff came up
Baltimore is worse than both of these teams
I was gonna go to the one yesterday actually
WELL OK, HOLD UP
Nah that too
Oh
Suns vs cavs lets go
Excuse you
I love watching the two worst teams play
get the fuck out
dab dab dab
Ikr?
get the fuck out
And I saw a kid dab on TV
I'm watching the Mariners game
Guys help
lmfao isn't as popular anymore
Although I still use it occasionally
wish i could think of some rn
Rekt
i'm pretty sure there are lots we used in like ninth grade that are no longer popular
ripperoon
rip, f, l, and oof are all pretty recent additions to our vocabulary
Oh

no fuck you
inb4 starbot "fuck you"
Wait oh no
<@470822754262712329> play some party music please
Hi
It's about time
There's been like one-to-two people all day today
yasss party
@here there are so many of y'all omg
*rip the FLoof*
FLoof lmao
floof!
We're gonna be roasted for this in the future
FLoof
i was gonna try to spell something
damnit
Ouch
Damn
Oof

F
Rip
Not just lol
that's fair
rip
like it would be hard to get us to stop using lol a lot lol
i'll wait
find me another guy who benches almost 300 and uses XD
he probably grew up with XD for longer than we did
but i am more entertained by the juxtaposition of person and use of XD
i don't judge because i would love to do it too
okay i don't judge people for using XD honestly
Love him tho
remember nigahiga's old video about annoying people on the internet? all of those have become so commonplace it's sad
Mark Mirador uses XD a lot
view the native XD in its habitat
lol
Lmao true lol
typing "lol" after everything gets so boring
i kinda wish i still could
Eh, they meant it in good fun. There were worse moments in that class.
yeah i used to use xd a lot too
ok ngl nicholas is great and is fun to talk to
aw rip gene i'm sorry
what are some notable phrases
I got called out for it in the 5/6 Block chat, and they never let me live it down
whoa what how does he text
(no offense meant)
okay but you also don't look like you could snap my spine
Me a year ago
which i find fucking priceless
texts like a middle school girl with the occasional XD thrown in
who btw
"jarrett is typing..."
saint nicholas

oh my lord
No, no

Herc

if this is  thing, anyone wanna be my noah stand-in lol :p
it's probably great to go to anyway
idk
This sounds like it's not school-sponsered
Also, I've had so many encounters with people who recognize me but who I feel like I've never seen in my life
lol
that might not be school-sponsored
Is it school-sponsered though?
u lie
also gene
do i really just have that good of a memory
today was microsoft intern day and i met two people i was in cahoots with during middle school and neither of them remembered ever seeing me
rip
sounds like CMU comp sci
"stay inside and cry" culture
insert *ring before spring* byu joke
yeah it depends on the school culture
I don't think UW does tbh
Ahh ok
i looked this up and apparently some but not all colleges have a school sponsored formal
Yeah, but I thought they were organized by frats and sororities
have you ever heard of there being a "formal" like a prom for college?
Yeah, I don't exactly feel comfortable drinking in college. I'm sure there'll be mostly social stuff, but I doubt they're gonna be traditional "college parties" so to speak.
i love the idea of having a purely fun social function but i don't think i'll enjoy the type of party that's just drinking
yeah same
I'll probably go for the experience and inevitably leave when I decide I don't like it
do you think you will go to a college party?
though i'm not surprised it's potato given its origins
Alcoholed potat
that explains its gross taste
Yeah
wait vodka is made of potato?
lmaoooooo
It's literally a liquid potato. I'm not surprised.
a shot of vodka is 100 cal
Gym buddies are good
Honestly, that sounds about right. Drinking puts on a lot more weight than people expect.
and i'll have access to a gym for the first time ever, and i'm sure to make some active friends
on the optimistic side, someone said the freshman 15 is mainly due to drinking alcohol and endless dorm snacking, both of which are easy for me to avoid doing excessively
lol having healthy options has almost never deterred me from getting foods i crave even when i'm full
I mean, maybe once you're there, you'll be more familiar with what's available and be able to identify the healthy stuff
mostly to save money lol
i hope my college friends won't want to eat out in the city too much
they have various cuisines rather than just southern food, thank god
I think the fact that you're so conscious about it is a good sign (until you're too conscious about it but that's aside the point)
i just know it's very delicious and highly rated
Do you know what kinds of food they have?
It's alright. Don't worry any it.
no they have really great meal plans so i won't be cooking
idk why i'm saying this bc ranting never helps me
Do you plan to cook for yourself at all in college?
Idk what to say
I'm sorry :/
but that isn't possible anymore and my self control with food can't be trusted by any measure
at some point in the past i was able to rely on only eating my mom's food to be healthy since she was on board with me losing weight
it's very daunting because for the next several years i will always be in a place where unhealthy food is widely available and eaten by all my peers
i know bmi isn't everything but it's really clear there's a lot i have to improve on
Don't live and die by it.
i was so fat that at three months old i had to wear one-year-old clothes because of horizontal dimensions
Still, BMI is a shit system for measuring individual health. I think that's important to remember.
i think mentally it's because i was fed way way too much as a baby lmao
and i give up on all my dieting plans super fast
I wasn't trying to do it right. I wasn't even trying to do it. I just got too lazy to eat because I was too unenergetic after not eating.
i just have way too much of a sweet tooth and can't resist things that are in front of me lol
one meal a day isn't necessarily bad if you do it right, but most people don't do it right
Me: I lost 10 pounds of weight after eating one meal a day and probably fucking up my metabolism and my ability to have energy
Asian BMI calculator: you're still a fat bitch
Me: *blinks* excuse me what
Ok, wait, wtf is up with this BMI calculator lmao
don't want to say "that's a later problem" but i already fucked up this entire week and today so i guess it really is
yeah idk when i'll actually be able to fix it since i've actively been trying for two years
I think it's more important to build healthy habits for college than just cutting weight now, but ultimately it's good that you're being mindful. Just stay balanced about it and don't be too hard on yourself.
https://aadi.joslin.org/en/am-i-at-risk/asian-bmi-calculator
then i'll really be overweight
problem is if i  don't fix something i'll gain more weight in college with so much more access to food
... can you send me the link?
asians are at risk at lower BMIs than white people
Also, if you're not overweight, that's what matters most tbh
There's an Asian BMI calculator?
also not happy but health is obviously the more important reason
according to an asian bmi calculator, i'm nearing overweight
I mean, are you still a healthy weight, or are you just not happy with where you're at?
because i gained a lot in the last two years, and specifically the last few months
That's a lot of pounds
Really? How come?
oof i need to lose 20 lbs somehow 😅
Tried to style my hair with some (a lot) of product. It's passable I guess.
No worries. Focus on work. Thank you for taking the time to talk to me.
at work rn
sorry i'm kinda in and out
<3
Thank you. I appreciate that.
i know it's frustrating but don't let it get to you too much
also even though you don't like the haircut you still look as lovable as always
well have fun
ah
I already showered before getting it cut, but I might try sticking my head in a sink
thats a rip
yeah i was gonna say it looks kinda uneven
The back is kinda a potato
have you tried taking a shower first and drying it off to see how it looks?
ah i see
The sides are janky as fuck and the volume on the top vs. the sides is all out of wack
what bothers you about it specifically
that's fair
ah
It's not godawful, but I'm just starting to get pissed with it
I appreciate the offer and might actually take you up on that
maybe it's not quite so bad
also send pics of the haircut?
if you need someone to bail you out tonight and help with hair i can *try* to help
in all seriousness
i'm sorry to hear that
ah
Although I probably shouldn't be calling. He's kinda there for a period of mourning and work, so he has his hands full.
So much for calling my Dad to clutch up
Fuck
~3 in the morning?
Wait, I have Google
East coast
depends on region
What time is it in China right now?
try to fix your hair
i mean if you want we can try to find a time to bail you out to hang out and like
gl
ah
I actually have to find the equipment first lmao
but like lay down a plastic bag first bc  little bits of hair are really annoying to clean
Very cool
Thank you, Starbot
get the fuck out
And she's pretty much friends with these people, so it's understandable why she'd be pissed
also just cut your hair in the sink
watch tutorials on double speed
ah i see
Like, my mom left the house for a bit. If I did this while she was home, it won't be a fun conversation
till...?
I have about half an hour though
that's what i did
and if you think you can pull it off, go for it
sit down and watch some tutorials on hair cuts
i would say
oof
I'm concerned because I'm a klutz, have shorter hair (so mistakes are way more noticeable), and my mom's probably gonna take offense to it, especially if I screw it up even more
i cut my own hair like 1-2 times a year
i haven't gotten a formal haircut in a very long time
it's a useful life skill
cut it yourself
i would say
rip
Which is probably gonna happen either way
aw
The alternative is to probably wear a hat until I go to college and I can find somewhere in Seattle to get my hair cut.
So I just got a haircut I'm pretty unhappy with (I haven't actually received a haircut I'm happy with since I got my hair cut short because my mom complained the place I used to go to was too expensive, so she started dragging me to where she gets her hair cut, but it's literally only $5 cheaper, and I'm still pissed about this). Is it worth digging out my dad's old haircut kit and trying to make some minor adjustments to my own hair with no experience whatsoever? My mom's really defensive about her place, so I can't criticize it, and it's kinda hard to communicate to the person who cuts the hair there.
I bet it's just that their site is super shitty lmao
idek
That's big brain
Wth lmao
yes
Did they at least refund you?
🤔 🤔 🤔
they still have it in my size
me: hops on site
they emailed me today saying they're out in my size
i got a pair of cute sandals for like $20
i placed an order like 2 days ago on the free shipping day
How so? I'm a little out of the loop.
tj maxx is a shady ho
can i just say that
fuck
Something something we're entering with a similar economy
Here comes the roaring twenties
Whoaaaaaa
About fucking time
The 2010s are gonna be over in less than 6 months
Y'all......,
Aww, I'm sorry, Helen
I am awake
Because I can't wrap my head around you making this noise
This sounds more like Peter doing a Homer impression than you doing one
Welp, that's cursed
I was told I do a fairly convincing homer simpson voice
I'm awake and idk what to do now
night
G'night
i agree
Get some rest, Salina
yeah
that was a deep news rabbit hole
Woah wait what
ok i'mma sleep now
think of it as shifting everything you're currently doing a few hours forward. you can still do all the things you enjoy, just minus the things you don't
it also really really helps to have some form of exercise. you don't even need like a full hour or whatever, just get yourself tired
try to lay down at a reasonable time and force yourself out of bed in the morning at a reasonable time
you probably can't sleep because your schedule is so messed up
Be kind to yourself please
Hope you feel better
Big rip
Aw gene
T h a n k
gimme a sec, I gotta find a fuck to give
<@470822754262712329> I need emotional support please
The sun coming up is a cry for help from nature pleading me not to be this dumb
Sun's coming up bitches
12:00-3:00: Denial of the fact that I actually have to get out of bed
3:00-6:00: Refusal to be productive out of spite for having dragged myself out of bed
6:00-8:00: Hunger from not having eaten in 24 hours drives me to overeat something probably unhealthy
8:00-12:00: I try to do something entertaining all while trying to convince myself I'll be productive later
12:00-3:00: Admitting I should probably sleep but accepting that it's gonna be a kinda late night and telling myself that's ok since it's summer
3:00-6:00: Panic sets in, I have a crisis or two about some random aspect of my life, I hate myself
6:00-12:00: Getting just enough sleep to forgive myself for what just happened so that I can convince myself that doing the exact same thing the next day is valid
"How long do I have until my parents get up"
Shredded cheese joke
"What's in the fridge"
I was a functional human being for like a week this summer
"how did I get here, will I ever leave here"
Na when the sun starts to come back up and you back in the light and the knowledge of what it means, that's peak sad boy hours
And it's like sad boi hours on hard mode
I actually can't fall asleep
still sad boi hours
suns not up yet
Is it still sad boi hours, or have I crossed into the morning?
my parents want to earn a ton of money themselves and i'll get inheritance from them so i think it's reasonable that i spend money for them when i earn it
literally I think this is half the reason my parents had kids
My parents have actively recognized this in Chinese culture and told me, "yeah, fuck that. Don't. Historically, it's only ever caused dramstic fighting in our family. It's dumb anyways."
idk about y’all but i sure can relate
Oof
reminded me of this article

i think it's just more of something the kids should do (unless there's some sort of abuse/neglect/etc)
like you should be nice to your teachers or be nice to waiters, you should do nice things to make your parents' lives easier
yea you don't have to be nice to your teachers and you can scream at waiters but it's not great
depends on the parent, the situation, and the kid
but putting entitlement behind it soils the point of such a relationship
but it is a nice thing to do
which my take is, it's not
depends if the children are entitled to their parents' duty to raise them
do y'all think parents are entitled to their kids' servitude
Riiip I'm sorry :/
i bought those together with a set of 3 mm ones
5mm gold ball studs
what do they look like btw?
sorry to hear that
rip
I went online to look for the same earring but the listing has disappeared, so i'm scared it means it is gone forever rather than being temporarily out of stock
curse my terrible reaction time
i lost an expensive earring on the bus and the worst thing is it's completely my own fault because i knew the moment it fell out a few seconds before my bus stop, and i decided to get off the bus instead of search for it, even though i could have stayed on for several more stops to look for it
today is a sad day
My desktop bitched out on me (rip, but thanks for all the Minecraft), and I was too young to figure out how to upgrade it, so this laptop carried the burden the rest of the way for 5 years
That depends more on your level of expertise with hardware
they grow with you
you just keep upgrading them
you never replace them
this is why I like desktops
That was a Homestuck reference to when a character had her vacuum cleaner bronzed
I'm looking for a successor that'd make him proud
Lol
is this tech’s version of taxidermy
Get it plated in bronze
clearly he’s dying why put him on life support and prolong his pain
i think you should relieve him of his misery
He's like a war hero at this point to me
Tell tales of his valor to future generations
Like a museum artifact
Keep him on a pedestal at home
Everyone deserves to retire eventually
He's been sputtering of late, and it'd be cruel to push him much further
Ok, but like
I wrote my History IA on this lad
You're hurting its feelings
Like, damn.
I'm pack-bonding with a laptop
I'm gonna be honest, I just started talking to my laptop because I felt bad that I was looking a replacement for my trusty pal who got me through 6 years of hell, including IB diploma.
This is my life now I suppose
two of my favorite internet topics, but even i don't bridge the two that fast
uhhhh that
My half-hour curiosity search for a potential new laptop went down a rabbit hole, and I'm somehow now on a night-long quest to better understand skin care. I don't know how I got here.
no
OwO
Like, exactly
It's been a month since we graduated
Holy shit
No, but I really want to cuz I know it does that lol
that's the one that depressed the hell outta me
have you played life is strange
Valiant Hearts: The Great War. It's kinda old (2013 or 2014?), but I'm just now getting around to it
Share the game name
God dammit not the sad piano music from the game's title screen
Alexa this is so sad play Despacito
And I'm actually kinda crying
I just finished a really sad game
Guys, help
F
oh some of the graphic designers have goldfish tanks on their desks
What
it's not every day when you hear about a group fish suicide in the workplace lmfao
Oh look, the sun's rising lol
i guess im staying up another hour
when something's 24/7 but decides to shank you during sad boi hours anyways
Earrings sound like an absolute L
I'm sorry
Yiiiiiike damn
it was kinda bloody rip
i basically had to repierce my right ear
Oof, what happened?
Ears: fuck youuuuu
Me: doesn’t wear earrings for two days
night lol
G'night
You've more than earned it.
But yeah. Do get some rest.
Alright. Well, if there's anything else you ever want to talk about, know I'm always here if you need someone to listen.
i should sleep
lol i'm good
Are there any more aspects of this you want to discuss? If you want to keep talking about something, I don't want you to feel like I'm impeding your ability to share your thoughts.
i'm the queen of ironically unironic bad humor
fight me bitch
keep it funky and chipmunky
You tell yourself that
a real wheely dealy
Sure
i'm better at it
shhh
Oh, I already do those
jk jk
the bad pun jokes
soooo
I honestly wish I could do what you do sometimes tbh
And, if anything, I respect it
No, I totally get it
but also not a me thing
cough you
Although I can see why where it can become annoying after a while. It becomes hard to be sympathetic after a while.
like props to the people who can do it w/o batting an eye
i don't do the gushy affirmation stuff as much
Honestly, sounds like a smart way to help others grow
i just try to pragmatic about these things sorry
be sympathetic but also don't feed the wallow sinkhole
basically i just shut up
How do you tend to deal with these situations?
I mean, you said it
*p e r s p e c t i v e*
all about
On one hand, denial is part of the learning process (granted, a very crude part of it and not one everyone moves past), but on the other, after it gets reiterated enough, you begin to worry if people ever do move past that and acknowledge other factors
absolutes are complete and utter bullshit
doesn't feel right to me
idk
but once you say that it's solely because of those factors
like i agree that problems can result from outside factors
I see what you're saying tho
And I can definitely see how that could make you more in tune with picking when that happens
i live with a raging narcissist so pardon if i kinda hate how people dodge responsibilities by living in the feels
You're just answering my questions
You don't need to apologize
sorry
the lack of personal accountability?
If you don't mind me asking
What in particular bothers you about it?
Ah, ok, I see what you mean
people wallowing in their emotions and insisting that all the blame is on something else
Could you give a generalized example?
their failures
Their failure or your failure?
but it's also something i'm working on
which tbf is something i'm also guilty of
i mind more of people rubbing in their failure
personally don't mind it that much
How do you feel when you realize you aren't celebrating your successes?
Granted, don't consider yourself invincible, but recognize that much at least
That's a skill
Be proud of that
Don't worry about it
I don't doubt that, and I'll take your word for it
and i don't mean that as being cocksure sorry
i think i deal with failure/change/fatigue better than most
honestly?
How comfortable are you with your ability to hold up alright if that land marker goes missing or you get tired going from one point to the nextml?
also i preserve the dignity of others
even though i def got hit by senioritis i was still a hella good student
and i've always liked that about the way i work
success isn't a milestone, but rather a land marker
what makes me such a consistent worker is that even if i do well i just go rifling on to the next task or figuring out the next big improvement
At the very worst, it never hurts to do a bit of window shopping.
Well, what are the potential costs here?
and while things can be improved, it also becomes a matter of the cost of improvement
as strictly pertaining to my experience, it's a minor problem that has coalesced to have greater implications
That frustration is more than justified.
You deserve better.
because nestled in it is a degree of frustration
First of all, I hate that saying. Things can always be improved.
but like i said, i thought it was something that warranted reflection
if it ain't broke don't fix it
*eh*
How do you want to break that routine?
I think that would stand to reason
but i wonder if the reason why i'm not incredibly proud of my achievements is because i've fallen into the routine of just not treating success as anything remarkable
this isn't being angsty
idk
Oh, alright. I get you.
but i'm just reflecting on frustrations
Well, that doesn't mean the smaller things aren't important
nothing really particularly problematic
overall? fine
Like, in general
How are you holding up?
You do a great job with the hand you're dealt. I'm proud of you.
it is what it is
shrug
I'm sorry I can't do anything to change this, but for what it's worth, I most definitely feel for you
Alright, I get you
i think i'll leave it at that
some things more than others
it's just little things here and there
eh
And you don't have to answer if you're not comfortable
Is there anything in particular that inspired this? Like is there something specific bothering you?
I don't mean to pry but like
It's a situational awareness thing I suppose
Logic flies out the window in favor of emotion for this one
And honestly, society doubling down on innate sense of doubt that is just kinda unfair
In that those with success begin to question why they were successful but not necessarily someone else
I think it's a product of guilt/shame in a sense
Definitely agreed
glorious double standard whaddup
still a societal reality that i think is toxic to an extent
but idk
honestly i know i can keep my mouth shut and logic it out
logic
What would do you think could help you reconcile these conflicting ideas?
What would you like to see?
but also the other side of not being allowed to celebrate achievements
shit like parts of asian culture that glorify certain achievements to the extent of internalized toxicity
We prefer it not to be celebrated in other people's faces in public, but I don't think that means it shouldn't be celebrated at all
like there's two sides of the coin
I agree that, as a society, we kinda view success in an odd light
lol it's ok gene
and i don't think success should only be relegated to a few but i also don't think it should be as reviled
Sorry, that was bad timing
*cue DJ Khalid suffering from success meme*
but an experience of success is supposed to shut up/take a back seat/be distributed to others
like if you have an experience of failure then you are expected to respond with pride/resilience/etc/etc
it's like a really weird inverse relationship
Your emotions are important too
the way emotion factors into this kind of shit infuriates me
We tend to forget that vastly different experience can coexist but don't necessarily have to invalidate one another
but idk
i do think emotions, for most part, are valid and i can't dislike someone for feeling the way that they do about something (most of the time)
I agree with you there
and experience of success is seen as an invalidation of the experience of failure
but when there is success or benefit the flaw is generally seen as outweighing it
it's all about raging against the system and its flaws
it just feels like humanity is inherently pessimistic
It's ok to feel frustrated. You have every right to feel so. Anyone would.
idk
But if it's any consolation, I just want to affirm that people do recognize the effort you put in (granted, maybe they don't see the entire extent of it cuz by virtue of being humble you're hiding some things, but the idea is still there), and that there are people genuinely appreciate it.
And for that, I'm genuinely sorry that you have to go through these situations. I can definitely see how uncomfortable it is to attempt to be humble and respect other people's boundaries (that's probably not the word, but you get the idea) yet to have certain other individuals fail to give you that same respect.
And honestly, regardless of that, it's unfair to you and other people who have self-control and awareness
People *should* reciprocate that. I think most people at least recognize that much. But the extent to which they actually do is highly variable.
I'm gonna be completely honest, I sometimes try (and occasionally fail a lot more often than I'd like to admit if I'm gonna be honest) to emulate that. The way you approach that kind of stuff is really admirable. And I get that that's not the main point, but I wanted to point that out first.
Alright, first of all, I wanna say that I actually recognize your efforts and really appreciate them. You're an extraordinarily humble person who's very situationally aware, and I respect that immensely.
(side note: splashing some water in my face cuz you deserve a proper response and not a delirious mess one sec)
go ahead
May I say something?
i'll prob delete this
idk dude
but i also find it frustrating that others use achievements/pride to vindicate their anger/emotion at something
because there's this idea that i've had it easy because i come from a place of privilege with a lot of accessible resources and a working brain
i just kind of freeze
like if someone asks me what's a flex/interesting fact about me
but a lot of the time the same courtesy isn't reciprocated
but i'm kinda frustrated by how i have to downplay certain things because i'm trying to be considerate
i can't tell if this is just years of just internalizing shit and telling myself that it's the right thing to do
I'll shut up for a hot minute
Go for it
Sure
Thanks
can i actually ramble for a bit
My favorite
Yay
it's more concerning when it seems like you're having a post-midnight crisis
What can you do
it's not that bad
Hey
But
It's problematic and probably annoying to you guys
Come online to rant, even about nothing
I do this practically every night at this point
Hahaha
Just
Or what about
Idk why
I could fucking burst out singing right now
That's cursed
Autocorrect tried to turn "spaghetti" into "sister"
Oh dear god
Without my spaghetti
How am I supposed to sleep at night
State that
Needed to like
go sleep
rip
Delirious as all fuck
Just
Nothing to rant about tonight
Hellllloooooooooo sad boi hours
Although you're not the disappointment child. Never tell yourself that. You're a wonderful human being, and no one can ever take that away from you.
Awww, I'm sorry, Cindy
I feel like this is my punishment for being the disappointment child tho bc my sister had it easy
it gets tedious but like I mow the lawn, do the laundry, vacuum, scrub the floors, do the dishes, and run a lot of errands for my parents
rip
I'm far more prepared to be an adult than most
I don't really mind
I'm sorry
Oof
my parents don't give a fuck lol
It's worked for my brother
I basically do all the chores in my house tbh
this is false
It's like the Uno reverse card
You just pull the allergies card on them
No one can ever force you to mow a lawn
but at the same time my allergies get noticeably less bad in other areas of the country
No, it's the best thing to be allergic to
it's everywhere help
man that'd be wack
really???? I thought I wasn't
So it might make sense
I know my brother's allergic to grass
this could explain it maybe
yw
Thanks, I hate it
that she's really pining for relief
you could say
That would be super oddly ironic
Wait really
never been tested but 98% sure I'm allergic to some sort of pine tree
noah's allergies have been really bad too
Idk what I'm allergic to tho lol
rip
I'm also willing to accept that
Or Sammamish is just weak
Oh
We really are secret twins
I'm p sure a lot of people in the area are
We must be allergic to the same thing
W H A T
IT'S THE WORST
DUDE SAME
My allergies are back with a vengeance for some reason
Noah is love noah is life?
What are you doing in my bedroom at 2:30 AM, Noah? ;)
Na that's just me
I think my room is haunted
i'd give him an 8.8ish
like out of 10
but he has a good penguin
idk
Why am I not aware of this though
it is a p sick penguin
as <@!340319804747415553> is aware
I have the best penguin stuffed animal
Idk
Is jacked not a synonym for took anymore?
*took
Could you rephrase that?
Uh
But Cindy jacked it from me
I had a penguin stuffed animal
Man
Piplup is high tier, not top tier
IRL piplup right there
That could be a piplup
See that
Show me your penguin
<@258094439636008971>
It's healthy to feel this alive
No, this is very much a W
L?
How else are you gonna feel alive
It's definitely worth it for the ability to hug a stuffed penguin while your eyes start tearing up over nothing as you have a crisis every night
But
Well, true
We're all killing our lifespans by being awake like this regularly
hmmm
what topic
angry boy hour
We hitting sad boi hours in full force
also correct <@!340319804747415553>
I'm confused what Helen finds funny
?
Hee
that's what he was working on last week
prob motors?
What simulations?
basically simulations aren't being very nice
Wdym?
I'm very sad
my results aren't converging
r i p
Except for those weirdos who get up at like 3 or 4
Yeah, I agree
that's solidly morning and not a weird-ass middle of the night thing
Cool
5 am
Out of curiosity, at what point do sad boi hours end by definition?
but I guess my point was I despise being cooped up and I want to contribute something to this world. also I hate children so that can't be it lol
"back when I was 'un, we used to wrestle bears in our spare time"
if they fall that's a hip replacement surgery
like if I fall down, I get a bruise and a scratch for a week maybe
lol
lmfao
how can you be four times my age AND four times as fit
why
dude park rangers scare me
maybe when I'm old
park ranger?
Until my 70-year-old bones can't log anymore firewood
ok I love hiking, I adore the outdoors obviously, but ultimately that's just for my enjoyment and I think I need to do something that really means something to me
If you get bored during retirement, hmu and we can do beach bonfires every day
otherwise what even is the point
hike?
I need to DO things
I get super restless after 1 day in the house
Retirement
I mean
I can't imagine accepting not having a job
It's ironic cuz I love kids and am great with them, but I'd never want to be responsible for one
stay-at-home dad Doc Wenton
Dem shrimp
Ew
be a stay-at-home dad
lol
being a trophy husband sounds awesome because I can be lazy AND progressive at the same time
i would totally dig having more money to spend
while i generally keep my shopping addiction in check
you see
see i’m desperate
no judgment at all but I would go insane
I would be so not okay with being a trophy wife
comp sci 400
It'll be a useful skill
Actually, I should learn some animation at some point in time
i’d be okay being a trophy wife
I WANNA BE ON SET WITH EGG TARTS

Peter Strizhev does tho

shut up i’m crying
Wait, hold up
**emily holland**

Those are high expectations, Emi. You should lower the bar like me and Alan. Just hope to go on a date someday and figure it out from there.
_i do_
🥺
"who wants to marry you"
"i have a friend"
"so uh"
<@460689096646590465> if I ever befriend Tom Holland, I'll spill all this tea to him
it’s a reach guys but i think i can do it
lol
and then it’ll be love at first sight and we’ll get married
My career hopes and dreams are the only tea I choose not to spill cuz even I only know bits and pieces of it lol
okay correction i would like to write a pixar screenplay so that i can cast tom holland and then meet him that way
except if it were me I would eat my child instantly
boop the danger noodle snoot
GENIUS
OMFG

underground asian lofi hiphop artist Doc Wenton's new album Free Trial releases 2022
ooh that's super cool
I have things like "this is what I want by this point in my life" or something, but I don't think that far ahead with my life
off topic i would like to write a pixar screenplay
twiligh: spilling t

twilight: breaking tea starring doc wenton
i was bad at defending my rationale when we were actually playing lol
I don't have a serious thing tho
lmfao
that sounds amazing <@!340319804747415553> and I would totally do that
it's gene
that's not even unexpected though honestly
there’s a lot of them
good luck
I've told Jane this one before, but I wanna meet every doggo before I die
oh I was just giving superficial examples not my actual goals
i voted u for vamp bc i imagined you like chilling by yourself listening to lofi and sipping tea as the world just went to shit over the ages
there's a pretty good difference
normal: move to new york and work for harper collins???
ngl tho
lmao alan
from climate change
weird: I wanna move to Iceland and reestablish my identity as a wildflower
i just wanna,,,not die
Y'ALL NEED TO HAVE HIGHER EXPECTATIONS
<@478706068223164416> sup?
normal: I wanna go on a date
idk what counts as "weird" maybe just like something people wouldn't expect
But maybe with a liiiiittle bit of effort, I just might be able to do one of those things
I know my list is a little crazy
thank u, next
ok sorry gene this is boring
So
I just eventually want at least one date. That fits the criteria
Oh, no, I'm ok dying alone
Guys, I know I have crazy expectations out of life
i was right
not die alone
so
AND I wanna go on a date at some point
wild
I wanna live in an apartment
This one's REALLY crazy
hang in there dude
BUT NOT ONLY THAT
lame
or that
oh
I wanna graduate college
not die alone?
what is it
But before I die
This is a little bit of a crazy one
Alright, guys
idk what’s weird
what counts as weird
i mean
Live two lives
I want to die before I die
gene's is apparently wanting to be in an intervention group
wait ok tea what's the weirdest thing y'all wanna do before you die
But who has underlying problems
Cuz it's gotta be someone we wouldn't normally be comfortable telling them something to their face
either/both
The "you're annoying" intervention or the "we're worried" intervention?
Depends on what type of intervention?
well i did it a lot for prom lol
no lol
do i online shop that much
rip?
Hmmn
Tea
Oooo
salina. this is an intervention. your online shopping addiction is hurting you. and us
Cindy, visit just to take part
who in this group is most likely to need an intervention
are you sure i'm not on the receiving end lol
Salina, you can join us
lol
y'all are on campus w me
well i am now
It wouldn't be you
should I be worried
we’re all holding envelops with our letters
I wanna be the one who says those words
YES
“blankity blank. this is an intervention”
And collectively give them a stern talking to
Like, I wanna be part of a group that ambushes someone upon entering their apartment
l maoooo
It's lowkey on my bucket list to be part of a group intervention for someone
lol i can't tell good jokes anymore
I'm gonna be honest
but now i'm like
i feel like i used to make bad jokes ironically
^^
salina you are Hilarious
i need an intervention
someone save me from my humor
putting the sad in sadist
Stop bullying me omg
l m a o
It was kinda amusing for two seconds, but then I started getting sad as well as it sunk in
I was basically Zendaya when watching Endgame next to Cindy ngl

when i do it's just taking a bit off the inner corner
i haven't had to trim some pairs
rip

otherwise i look like a porcelain doll
idk about you but with non asian made lashes i have to trim them
laughs in finding lashes on clearance

damn i'm good at doing shit like this
but i lost a single falsie
also dumber problem
<@460689096646590465> hanging out with y'all is always a bool
I mean, that's completely valid <@340319804747415553>. I'm sorry to hear that though. :(
i’m sorry salina :/
i’m having a good night bc i like hanging out with you guys
but somehow i just feel very uneasy
all the pieces of my life are mostly fine
it's like
i'm just like in a weird state
How is "*eh*" treating you?
but i'm glad you're having non sad boi hours
very *eh*
How is everyone here tonight?
So I'm not exactly feeling sad boi hours, but it's that time of day, so I'm chilling in this channel lol
I didn't see this until now but <@503787499605458954> 😘
You poor thing
Awww lmao
Gee sure glad I'm here to handle it all
Soooooo many orders being made
Look at the huge rush
I forgot we were talking about Brave New World for a sec when I saw the notification lol
not a fan of the kiddie sex but an interesting read so far
Ah, I see
I'm up to chapter 4
Nice book choice
check Instagram
make a chicken ceasar wrap
read another chapter of A Brave New World
F
Ah rip
fry some chicken strips
read a chapter of A Brave New World
flip a burger
do some Japanese
my last 4 hours have been
Get the fat cash
good luck dude
r i p
excl. thursday
catch me flipping burgers from 2-8 every day until Saturday
anyways
this was all because I was looking for more shifts and my boss was like "go ask the chef he needs people" and I thought he meant service people not cooks
I had *wanted* a service position, but since's there's literally nobody else to cook I'm stuck with it until the end of the week
I'm stuck cooking at work up to Saturday because of a miscommunication
also
that's a check
I had wanted to go hiking with Cindy prior to this year
<@193229269076279298> LOVE YOU, DUDE
just saw this
G'night! Get some rest! You're worth it. Thanks so much for the help tonight!
night!! it's been a ton of fun as always
Same
Oh shit
lol
I need to be up in 5 hours
it's 4 am
fuck
also
❤
Y'all are great people and deserve the world really
It's nice to see stuff working out well for everyone here
lol not surprised
You and Salina really came out of left field for me tbh
Oh, yeah
Like in hindsight lol
you, emi, and noah were all people who weren't really on my radar but am really thankful for now
Honestly, for me, that's kinda the vast majority of this group lol
I can see that
Yeah, def
Like Helen, for example, I always thought was super chill, but I never got too many opportunities to talk to her, but now I talk with her p regularly. And then Emi has always been a super awesome to me, but I never really talked to her a lot regularly, but then we've talked about some deep shit together and it's been great.
alan, jane, and david were all people i wanted to be better friends with who then became good friends so that's a solid win
To differing extents of course, but still
Gonna be honest, for me personally, I feel like before my senior year, a lot of the people I wished I was closer friends with suddenly became closer friends lmao
You'd be a hard-pressed to find a better human being
Still love the dude tho
I feel kinda bad about that one cuz I feel like I used to be closer with him but then I stopped having classes with him after like freshman year
we're friends bc we have a lot of mutual friends but I still don't know him that well
Omg
oh also Fran
But still love the dude tho
Yeah, I always knew Tyler indirectly through other people
haven't spent time w Tyler outside of school since soph year
I was p decent friends w Rach and Tyler this year but we never really hung out so I wish that happened
Rip computers determining our social lives once again
and it kinda died from there
I didn't really have classes w most of these people towards the end
Ah ok I see
these days my main connection to like Steph and Emma are through April, who became way closer to them this year
Ok, respect. That's valid
just not ever super close
everyone else though yeah
ok I was never really friends w Sid
No, I totally get that
Were you ever actually friends with these people, or are these more of a general "people I wish I was friends with"?
not bc I wanna be a party girl or whatever but bc she's genuinely actually really smart and I feel like she doesn't have a lot of real friends
Yeah
I mentioned Michelle yesterday I think
I miss those two a lot
Omg
That's not the greatest first impression but I'll take your word for it lol
oh also Sid and Matthew Bellavia
actually out of his league so idk why
um she dated samyak idk if they're still together but she's like
Ohhh ok
she's a queen
issaquah deca legend
Idk who that one is lol
muskaan
noah shauf
Ofc
bc he's a god
Omg everyone loves Tyler
there's a lot
Tyler!!!
Rachna
Lol solid picks tho
Emma S
I didn't realize you were friends with these people
hmmm
Stephanie
Oh damn
Audrey
New tea prompt: any of your looser friends you wish you were closer to cuz they seem like cool people?
We all combine to form one super friend
yeah most of my current friends have several of the traits I'm thinking of
You should ideally have anyways
Which like
I feel like that's still achievable through having multiple friends
But
yep
Ok, I won't sugar coat it, cuz that's pretty damn contradictory lol
idk like I want a partner in crime who's down for basically anything and wouldn't judge, but also someone who pushes me to be better. so like, willing to indulge bad impulses but also a genuinely good person who makes me want to be more genuinely good? I feel like that's pretty contradictory
How so?
Oh?
idk if my ideal friend feasibly exists
Spill
oh right I still haven't responded to the ideal friend thing
(And Noah and Bethany and anyone else this applies to, if you are somehow reading this, no shade. Still love ya guys lol)
Same with Bethany, although she might actually just process the info and just not feel like acknowledging she's read it
I could ping Noah right now, and he won't bat an eye at the notification to realize that in roasting him in the morning
lmao rip
You're one of my more responsive friends, so maybe the bar is just set really low in my eyes lol
there is little in-between
I'm that friend who responds in either 0.2 seconds or like 4 days late
It's all about dem perspectives
I mean, at least you're self-aware then. At the end of the day, I can only speak for my own experiences of communicating with you
oops
though I do feel like it at least annoys a lot of people
thanks gene
So maybe when you do contact people, it really counts. Or maybe you're just good at getting to things in time. Or maybe it really just isn't that bad. Idk what it is, but whatever you're doing, it works, so I wouldn't worry about it too much
so............................ ???
at the same time, I love being around people and love being the life of the party
in the past it was just that social interaction tired me out super fast but I never woke up and felt like "man, I just really fuckin don't wanna deal with people today" lol
One thing for sure, I think you do a great job of communicating with other people as is
Well
idk if it's healthy, it got a lot more extreme in recent years
Don't give yourself too much crap for that
But anyways, yeah, I think that's super valid and healthy if anything
Which is honestly what made me suspish to begin with lol
lol
That sophomore from Eastside Catholic who was probably hitting on me
Well, one exception
most of the time I don't actually open the messages till I'm ready to respond
I've never met someone who's chattier and pushier over text than I am
I think it's best if I don't know if they read what I sent or not sometimes
I'm kinda used to people ignoring my shit
Part of the reason I don't have snap lol
I know it annoys some people but man it lets me live in peace
also dude the lack of read receipts on discord is SUCH A BLESSING
Sounds healthy if anything
I don't feel like that's super problematic
so I can be a total hermit
I probably said like 5 sentences to my parents per day and that was it
I mean, I will never be able to tell if you ignore my notifications lol
one time I went 3 days with basically no outside human contact
yknow I don't really know
How long does like a cycle tend to be for you?
I just flat ignore notifications a lot
really?
Maybe I'm blind tho
Tbh, you allude to the alternating chattiness and disappearing thing a lot, but I've never noticed it
yeah I was p dead 99% of the time in school
I don't feel like I saw the really outgoing part of you until senior year tbh lol
though I'm not sure it's better to be friends w me and be subjected to alternating chattiness and my disappearing-off-the-face-of-the-earth act
I get self-conscious about it and try to force a 180 sometimes, but then it catches people off-guard, and that lands squarely in "awkward"
Honestly, I feel like I do something similar
if I'm not super close with you you tend to get either introverted nerd or super outgoing from me and never see the other side lol
Chill energy is good energy
Like, I wanna be around that a lot of the time tbh
I have so much respect and admiration for people who just live in the chill range for the majority of their life
Which is why it takes time
True I get you
it's a weird balance between chill and awkward
Like, I put out a lot of outwards energy, so like I get that like sometimes other people feel like they have to try to match that somehow, but then I'm like, "wait, no, come back, I actually wanted that other side of you waaaiiiit"
Yeah, I'm really sad when people hide their quieter side, but I also get it
Although I still appreciate them as people
some people just hide the quieter side more than others and/or require less chill time
I can think of a few cases
idk if it's humanly possible
I don't think I've ever met someone who's legitimately energetic 24/7
LMAO funny enough i didn't actually pick up on that till you brought it up
That sounded way more sexual than I intended it to
Different energy levels is really awesome, cuz it's like different flavors of the same person
Just having like
I still appreciate energy (in fact, it's probably still ideal in most cases), but having it not be 24/7 is nice
They either should be outgoing but still have a quieter, chill side or just be a quieter person in general. I'm a little offput when someone manages to be super energetic 24/7 ironically enough. If I can't do it, I get a little concerned when you can
And then last thing is kinda weird but
lol
Like, bitch, ya better enjoy my antics, or idk what the hell you're gonna find funny
And then like the only shallower thing I require is that they have to have a reasonably acceptable sense of humor
Open-mindedness too
Has really different interests. Pushes me to explore some of their things but like respects my boundaries. I like talking to people about different things or explaining/being explained something for the first time, even if direct involvement never happens (although it often does)
Someone with the patience and emotional capacity to actually help me when I inevitably need it but is also open to me doing the same for them as well
Ohhh hmm
what's *your* ideal friend like
Which one?
Lmao no worries
also I forgot to answer the earlier question
aw thanks
So you're good to go lol
Not to toot my own horn, but my confidence rarely is
same but then I wonder if that confidence is misplaced
I think you're gonna do great in college tbh
Although knowing you, I'm def sure you'll meet those people
Interesting. I could def see that.
volunteering
talking politics
swimming
working out
exploring the city
eating, drinking, partying, also p typical
hiking, climbing, obviously
Out of curiosity
What kinds of things do you look forward to doing with people in college?
No, I get you lol
and it's sad
I DON'T HAVE FRIENDS TO DO THINGS WITH
but at the same time
like I super value all of y'all and the many different takes on life
I do but also don't
Honestly, that's the weird thing, but I really like friends who are into different things than me
and I really want that to change but idk if i even know how to interact with people who *gasp* are into similar stuff
Tea time, but what's your ideal friend?
I feel like I was thinking in much shallower terms lol in the sense that as of right now I have basically no friends who actually share my interests
oh rip
Like, at UW A&O, people were actually kinda becoming friends, and I was like, "dude, after tomorrow, I won't see you in another 2.5 months nor remember what you look like lol"
The problem is, I don't make the type of friends that I want unless I spend a lot of time with, cuz like I honestly don't care as much as people I won't be around for an extended period of time
yay
That's kinda what I'm saying
That
Yeah
I'm not concerned about making friends, I'm concerned about making the kind of friends that I want
I'm more concerned about making friends in college lol
I hope
I mean, while it doesn't seem like a skill, we probably underestimate its value
oof too real man
Cw was trying to tell us that IB taught us how to manage time for college, but I'm just sitting here like "IB taught me I can waste hours of my life away watching YouTube videos, do the bare minimum, and get four hours of sleep a night at the low cost of hating myself and my life, and I'm not sure how that translates to college"
I'm gonna be watching niche YouTube videos in my dorm all day when I don't have class
This is gonna be why I can't make friends in college
But in reality, I would never touch half of the shit he eats, and I just flat out don't have access to the other half
lol
He's an absolute icon tho, and I love him
But like the videos are like 15 minutes long
Nah, even worse, I watch that one dude who reviews fast food unironically now
~~I love food way too much~~
but they're like. mesmerizing somehow idk
I literally think half their recipes look nasty
Lmao
idk why they're so addictive
Reddit's dangerous cuz I'll just scroll through shit, and there'll always be relatively interesting content. I should just go back to frequenting a few important subs and stopping after it gets boring
oh also fucking TASTY VIDEOS
true
I think when YouTube starts recommending boring shit instead of what you're actually looking for is a p good sign you've gone off the deep end lol
I tend to go down weird rabbit holes of music or vine compilations
Like, some shit is like "oh, I GOTTA watch this video" and others times you're like, "wait, why am I 7 minutes into watching a video about the evolution of chicken farming over human history"
yeah
YouTube especially
same
Ok, the tricky thing is sometimes I do genuinely enjoy it and other times it's a time kill
they can be productive, I just often don't use them productively
it kiiinda does but the thing is I've realized a lot of the time I don't actually enjoy it that much, those are just the apps I open to kill time
Thank you, Cindy
It's not like YouTube and Reddit aren't productive. It counts as "me time" if that's what helps people chill.
but I think it helps
trust me I'm not much more productive than you, I too waste a lot of time on youtube and reddit
I think I'll give that a go tomorrow
But anyways, I think that's starting to make a little more sense
Lmao
just a little
2+ hours of masturbation sounds like a bit much ngl
weirdly it's easy to forget
I'm actually kinda having a hard time believing I skipped over that step lol
-read the news
-exercise at LEAST 15 mins intensely (busy days) or 60+ mins low/moderate (i.e. walking a lot or an easy hike)
-cook 2 meals (unless going out to eat)
-8+ cups or 2+ full bottles of water
-2+ hours of me time (ok I wrote that and it sounds like masturbation but that's not what I mean lmaooo I mean like doing something I genuinely enjoy without obligations or necessarily any benefits besides fun)
You're definitely right about breaking things down and detailing out what I wanna do tho. That actually does help clear up a lot of things tbh.
Just out of curiosity for the sake of an example
What do you try to do?
I don't really have a legitimate routine but I have like a set of mini daily goals I try to run through each day
But like breaking things down
Well, I'm not saying like a strict schedule
you don't *have* to make a schedule or give yourself deadlines, it might feel too school-like, but it might help if that kinda thing tends to work for you
But yeah, that makes sense. I guess laying out more specific plans is kinda what I got to do. It's kinda how I got through IB and the shitload of homework. There's less structure to my day, but I guess you're right in how that general approach shouldn't really change
for the reading, drawing, and instrument, start by picking some books, picking some specific drawings or techniques you'd like to try, picking an instrument and some basic songs or exercises
David would roast my ass for this if he were here right now cuz this type of organization and time management is like a cornerstone of game development lol
some suggestions for some of the others: for cooking, I often make a weekly meal plan for myself so I know what I need to buy and prep ahead of time
for some of yours - I would recommend organizing by priority first. what's actually most important to you? I would assume registering for classes. I read your whole thing in the college channel, I just didn't feel super equipped to respond considering I know jack shit about UW, but honestly, whatever you choose won't matter too much, just make a decision and roll w it
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense
the reason I asked for specifics was because your initial list seemed pretty vague. tons of people say they wanna do shit in some grand gesture and then never actually commit to it. one of the best pieces of advice I ever got was that vague goals pretty much always end in failure, because it seems like this huge, insurmountable obstacle if you just put down, for example, "learn to code". I guess my main advice if you genuinely want to accomplish most/all of those things is to specify each thing you want to do and break each goal into much smaller steps. going with the earlier example, if you wanted to learn to code, you could find an online course and list out a lesson plan for yourself as the steps
Not every instrument is easy to learn like a fucking saxophone lol
Yeah, I just wanted to start learning something. Important clarification lol
I'm sure you're aware that mastering art or a brand new instrument also isn't gonna happen that quickly
Idk how much I trust myself to have that level of motivation
But am I gonna do it?
Yeah, it's not undoable
Oh, I also wanted to get into DnD too
I actually don't think that's undoable
Ok, now that I have that written down, I can kinda see that that's kinda a fuck ton of shit lol
-I have a idea for a game that I should at least flesh out a prototype for, if at the very least to get some practice in on
-I should practice drawing cuz I'm ass at it and always wanted to be decent
-Register for classes
-Get through that cooking document I sent you
-Read a book or two and discuss them with people
-Learn a new instrument (although maybe this isn't possible for now because of my surgery, but I guess there is a piano downstairs if I got desperate)
-Organize a game jam for GDD club
Hmm
anything specific?
Maybe learn something new and pick up a hobby
Work on some personal projects, spend more time not lying down, reading, hanging out with friends, and getting fall quarter and beyond sorted out are the first things that come to mind
what's something you want to and have the time/capability to accomplish now
fair enough, and also v relatable
I feel like a large part of why I disliked high school was because I always shifted blame towards it for obstructing me from the things I wanted out of life, but at the end of the day, the only reason I didn't have them was cuz I'm a lazy ass, and that's not something that'll fix itself now that high school's over
Disappointment is just something I kinda gotta get used to
But like
Which is a good thing at times
I'm just really bad at accepting things as they are
Yeah
and you're self-aware enough to consider possibly being too self-absorbed
as you just said, it's a part of life
I'm probably too self-absorbed to step back and give myself some perspective lol
No idea why I keep doing it tho
Yeah, I feel like it's a part of life
and uh painful relate on the "lofty goals that translate into tired laziness and disappointment" thing
no worries rant as much as you want/need
sorry I'm back
Sorry, I'll stop my dramatic rant there for now lol
Hell, I had like a solid hour where I was like "registering for classes is hard. College isn't what I expected. Maybe it's not meant for me, and I should just drop out now" before I realized that I haven't even moved out yet
Pretty sure it's less of me actually being overworked and more of me just being a moody bitch without the ability to commit. Not like to the extent of like bipolar disorder or anything, but like maybe I set goals that were too ambitious for myself and just feel dead inside once I feel the sheer weight of said goals
"ima make an egg so that this pill doesn't make me puke and ruin the stitches in my mouth"
And this week I'm like
Shit, I was like actually spending a lot of time cooking a lot of shit last week that was cool and stuff
I don't feel burnt out in the traditional sense
maybe you're like still overworking yourself even though it's break
And then since then I've potatoed through life despite having things I told myself I would do/wanted to do
Like last week I had A&O, had that movie night thing, and organized a shit ton of things for the bonfire
Every time on a break, I'll be super energetic for like a week and then die for another two
I kinda hate it
is this a habit you actually wanna change or are you chill w it
It's a big difference
But like in fresh clothes
Then I'll take a shower and proceed to lie down on a couch or my bed again
Only things that actually get me out of bed is my phone's battery slipping away or needing to use the bathroom
Binge YouTube videos, scroll through Reddit, have a crisis, spend too much time on Discord, dread actually getting out of bed, fall asleep, have another crisis, repeat
what do you usually do while in bed?
Gets me off my phone and somewhat upright
obviously
Ironically, I think it'll be good for me to sit in a theater in a few hours
I'll prob go sometime this week I'm not in a huge hurry though
Yeah
oh nice!
Well, today I guess
I'm going to go see it tomorrow
I've heard it's p good
Cuz movie tickets expensive lol
I honestly forgot ffh is out
oh
Stop being obsessed and learn to let go of shit
Or like
Honestly seeing Far From Home is my priority at this point, but I really should get around to seeing the rerelease too
To make the big sad even bigger
Maybe they amplified the end-credit sound
yeah that's what I've heard
I imagine it's like a deleted scene and some form of a tribute
I bet it's like 10 mins
Cuz like, idk how much they added, and I'm not entirely sure if it's worth sitting through yet
no and no
Or like know anyone who has?
Have you seen the Endgame rerelease yet?
lmfaooo
Geographic luck
I discovered a while ago that my room is surprisingly soundproof
I could never do that, but I have mad respect for anyone who can
Interesting
Really
chill stuff I just sing
mostly hype stuff
Like hype stuff, chill stuff, or a bit of both?
So like when you solo dance, what kind of dancing is it?
Lol
no but I just added it to my spotify queue lol
Are you dancing to Despacito right now?
noted and appreciated ❤
And respect
Hey, I'm here all night most nights if you need to sad boi away lol
in other news, despacito is still unironically one of my fave songs to dance to
whatever that's enough sadboi for today
and they don't even know the half of it lmao
I joke a lot that I've fucked up enough to lower their expectations, but it's like. really true
And that's worth taking into consideration
I know it's not, but I still disagree
that's not a request for validation, just a statement of fact
You're doing great, Cindy. Don't let it get to your head
I'm kind of a shitty child
I can kinda see where she's coming from, even if I don't like it lol
do I though
You still deserve better tho
:/
leaving in a month and a half anyways
I'll be fine
like I said she's usually not this bad and I suspect the increased rage is bc she's on call for work this week and is tired/taking frustration out on me
Doesn't sound like the greatest spot to be in, but I'm glad to see you're holding up alright
I hope the situation gets better soon tho
Yike, I'm sorry about that
but I'm honestly over it
today my mom got pissed @ me for not wanting to talk to her
mostly fine
How've you been holding up?
Just cuz I had that phase doesn't mean I'm still in it
Lmao
sorry kidding lmao
you mean you're not?
Although I look like a middle school edgelord in that photo
oh rip
Shows up better in the mirror
I only started noticing it today
I didn't notice them at all yesterday
They're pretty dark in person
It looks better in the picture
they aren't that dark at least
it's not THAT bad
rip
Not the most flattering picture, but it's kinda the point
Idk it's weird
try an eye cream?
huh
Also, I have huge-ass bags under my eyes despite getting enough sleep every night
lol
One of these days, I will befriend someone who is a slower bitch than me and treasure them forever for the sake of my ego
no offense
most of my friends are weak
I have never not been the slow bitch
dw I don't mind at all
I have a lot of sympathy for slow bitches bc I have spent years being the slow bitch to my sister
But if you're ok with that, then maybe
I'm not great at hiking and will probably be a slow bitch
wanna come hiking sometime
I should drag you out of the house more
Either sleeping or just lying down
Like, not even sitting
I spend like 16 hours a day parallel to the ground
It's been kinda concerning
Idk if I'd go full nocturnal. I'm just currently semi-nocturnal out of laziness.
if I didn't usually have plans during the day / it wasn't frequently actually nice out I'd be a lot more nocturnal lol
At least you're actually sleeping tho
yknow how we were talking about an extended winter break
Honestly, that's kinda where I'm at too
I can’t help it.
jesus
3 or 4 for me.
Damn nice
but I got up at noon yesterday
usually
I've been rolling out of bed at like 2 these days
10-11
Cuz like
Lmao what hour have you been waking up at these days, Cindy?
And <@561219716429905920> but only cuz you refuse to sleep at all
lol
Ah, I can always count on Cindy to also not have a normal sleep schedule
00s pop is self-care
I'm in the middle of another random solo dance party
helloooo
It's kinda weird seeing so few people online
Anyone still awake?
F
i was nearly asleep when i suddenly decided to sign on and write this
G'night
B Y E
S l e e p
Many things are very neat. We just don't care to appreciate it.
also i need to sleep
tech is so weird
the fact that we can transmit information between each other through some electrons on a screen is pretty neat
BOOOOO
midnight thoughts -- a personality is basically the operating system of a human
I'm glad to hear
Sorry, I just saw this
over my angst
fine
How are you holding up at the moment?
honestly a p solid upgrade
I made a run for it and am now barricaded in my room
I might be misremembering the dates tho, but I'm p sure I'm right
Because BC was still in session
oh cool
They had a sign outside their thing when we were picking up diplomas that was like "also giving diplomas July 1+2"
huh
Also, I'm p sure Skyline is still giving out diplomas tomorrow @everyone, especially <@&532797874627543080> and <@503787499605458954>
Maybe Skyward's super senioring
Ripperoni tho when no one asks Skyward where Skyward is going to college
But having used Canvas before, it's better than Apex's UI (for online classes), and that's a fucking blessing
Now you get to do assignments on it too
we're only gonna be stuck with canvas for 1/3 the time
yea ok that's not gonna improve in college
*laughs in terrible UI*
Hah, yes, cuz Canvas will be so much better
i would feel bad about deleting him, plus we had genuinely entertaining conversations
fr tho fuck that app, that website, its shitty coding, and everything it represented
lol
Oof
?
<@!472541429130854421>
you mean jeffrey li?
Skyward is that one clingy person who always had a crush on you, but you always got put in the same group, so you had to work with them and check in on them regularly
ha skyward i deleted you first 😠
About fuckin' time
we have been deleted from skyward
Then again, we literally have a map of this shit
agreeeeee
Fair enough
no yeah same but still
For some people, I'm genuinely curious though!
ok I would like to add to the filler conversation list and say that for classmates a big one is "where are you going for college/what are you planning to study"
Awww thank you
I do not find you boring, for the record
I mean, that's more on me
oop
Gonna be honest, Cindy, the latter one was the majority of the car ride to Issaquah today sorry lol
rip
The first is for complete strangers and the second one is for friends
When I'm small talking, it's either "the social situation requires that I continue speaking with you but I don't have anything to say sorry" or "I find you interesting and want to keep talking to you, but I'm out of things to say and really wish you would say something so I know you don't find me boring"
yeah but no one actually knows shit about the weather we're just like "it's beautiful today" or "looks like it's going to rain" or "it's been super cold lately"
introducing yourself, your workplace, where you're from, etc. to someone who's merely curious and not interrogating you
I hate that weather is considered small talk, cuz the weather can actually be really interesting
and for parents, casually mentioning their kids
i think small talk is the kind of conversation you have with people that you don't know super well
ok fr this is so stereotypical but the only legitimate topics I can think of that I would classify as "small talk" are the weather and "how's your day going/how have you been"
<@561219716429905920> can confirm that I use this technique a lot
It's the only socially acceptable thing to do
it's hard to separate small talk from a real discussion
Ask somebody how their day is for the fourth time in the past hour
topics like things in life
Laughs in sales
I’m very good when I want something
what do you actually talk *about* though
huh
my mom is reaaaaaally good at small talk
lol alan
kinda both
is that a legit question or a rhetorical question cindy
My brother
If I actively don't have something to talk about, I start struggling
sociopaths
some people
ok then who actually IS good at small talk
oof
Rip
My method is that I do something embarrassing and proceed to have a conversation about that with someone
Filler conversation
i can almost certainly be entertaining to someone who barely talks though
define small talk
I'm surprisingly not great at small talk
yeah same sometimes i'm super entertaining and sometimes i'm awkward as hell
Depends on what piques interest
I can be strangely good at small talk but it tends to be hit and miss
i'm not good at small talk
close friends are a p even split for me but closest friends are all girls
It’s a good time
I’m just good at being a fake bitch
I have more gal friends
if i meet random people in a room i'm more likely to start talking to females, but more of my close friends are guys
<@503787499605458954> agreed
I have more male friends
except gender flipped of course
same for me gene
<@472541429130854421> I numerically have more male friends, but most of my close friends aren't male, so it's kinda weird
ANYWAYS my whole point was that (this doesn't have to do with attractiveness) like on an objective scale the average girl is nicer to look at than the average guy
Epitome of gorgeous personality
There's a reason why I have more male than female friends
when they suck they suck straighforwardly. usually.
Incels are a thing
see I feel like men are simple creatures
I mean
<@340319804747415553> we deduced this ages ago
Rip?
true
Girls sometimes have the least cute personalities tho
If there's anything at all we can do, don't ever hesitate to reach out
Hey
Well that’s terrifying
No worries, Cindy
lmfaooo
Shit I’m turning into Noah
And the timing of that message was a little off cuz I'm slow at typing rip
love y'all
thanks gene
Lol
Those washboard abs
Gotta have those buff arms
Cindy, I just want to say that you're a wonderful friend and human being. As yours friends, we couldn't be any prouder of who you are and the things that you do. You've accomplished amazing things and don't deserve for that to be called into question, so I just want to say that you're doing amazing and that we're here to support you no matter what happens.
I mean if you compare like a disfigured female to a male model
R I p
Why almost all?
tbh (I've said this before) I think girls are objectively better looking than men in almost all cases
Objectively it's true
girls are in fact cute
I hope it gets better soon
like I said yesterday I have a weird relationship w them
I feel like maybe my mom had a shitty day at work and is taking it out on me
I'm just glad Cindy agrees that girls are cute
honestly they're usually not too bad compared to some of my friends' situations
I feel like it's better to be on a need to know basis for that
I'm so sorry that situation with your parents. You deserve so much better.
Probably a smart decision
also I've just decided that my parents are never finding out that I'm bi until I am fully self-sufficient bc they might actually disown me
I hope ranting helped
better now than I was pre-rant
How are you holding up at the moment?
And L
well, I've locked myself in my bathroom w my laptop so I should be good for now lol
You can get it in August
If it helps, Skyline is giving out diplomas tomorrow if I remember correctly, although I understand that might not be a priority right now
Rip
Ah
You don't deserve any of this
Oh my gosh I'm so sorry, Cindy
Oh man I'm so sorry
I can't wait to be out of this house
and has convinced herself that I've failed my exams and won't get my ib diploma and that I'll get kicked out of college while hysterically being like YOU NEED TO PREPARE FOR THE WORST
now she's mad bc I a) didn't contact them today, b) that I never got my diploma, and c) that she couldn't see my final grades bc our skyward accounts got deleted, which is literally not my fault lmao
today I went hiking bc I refuse to become a shut-in just because I can't drive or text
so yesterday ended w her screaming at me to clean my room?? it was kinda strange but whatever
for some reason when she's pissed at me everything snowballs and she pulls out every single thing I've done "wrong" in her eyes in recent memory and like weaponizes it
idk man I told you she was mad at me for going to pride right so she has my keys and phone rn
man, I was really hoping I wouldn't have to actually use this channel during the summer
We're here for you if you need someone to listen
Do you wanna talk about it?
mother
<@503787499605458954> what's up? Everything alright?
I'm gonna scream
Yeah, then I don't trust this idea
No purpose at all
Unless there's an actual purpose to this
True
I hard veto this
Lmao
Dear god no
Should we make a middle school band group chat
Lol
Lmao he just reached out to me on Messenger
No one does lmao
But just going by sound I like the original more
I don't have the context to why it changed
Also I hate the new name of poll party
Hahaha
It's been done
Add him to ~~Poll Party~~ Survey Soirée
Welp, now that he's my Facebook friend, there's only one more thing left to do
Random observation but his eyebrows look really good
I hope he's doing well
Yeah
It looks like a new account
Same
I'm kinda honored that he remembers me
Same, I accepted
He moved to Idaho a while back
I just got a Facebook friend request from Luke Mcgarvey, that blond clarinet dude from middle school band
Can't relate tbh, but I can feel that
A greater betrayal is when a popsocket pops off by itself
No
What is it then?
Yes
Is there truly a greater feeling of betrayal than when the glob of toothpaste falls off of your toothbrush as you're putting it into your mouth?
Also <@261949028994908170> it's always sad boi hours
^yeah, this is where I am
I've definitely had eggs marinated with something but it was most likely other spices
cha ye dan?
Also I'm not sure if I'd had tea eggs anymore
lol
doesn't sound insane that I'd have an egg that was cooked inside tea
I've had a lot of tea and a lot of eggs
wydm "probably"
probably
new objective: make tea eggs for gene
poll of all the asian people here: have you eaten a tea egg
Yes
ok but you've had them
I used to
helen you eat tea eggs right
true
It's so disconcerting to see the spelling "sad boy hours"
sad boi hours is all hours
the answer is *delicious*

Sad boy hours already..?
da fuck is egg tea?
i've never heard of this before today
are you even chinese
alarmed
I'm
<@!258094439636008971> you've never had a tea egg???????????
If you wanna talk about it or there's anything you need, let us know
Although stepping away for a bit for a breather sounds smart
I'm sorry to hear about that
My sanity is like done
I will probably just go outside for a walk
Yike, how are you holding up?
But alas instead we have world war three happening downstairs
Someone who should have the maturity to handle situations went hulk smash on an innocent breakfast plate sitting on the table
Well
What happened?
plate death count: 1
aw
But what are you gonna do? Cry into a pillow? Oh wait, it's on your bed.
I just realized you've effectively ruined the day for yourself when you've made lying down uncomfortable
rip
lol
Five hours later, I'm considering maybe getting up because my neck is hurting and my phone is running out of battery
🤷
idk
Halfway through 2019
What am I doing with my life lol
Holy shit, tomorrow is July
I guess some tea could be seen as almost savory, but we still sweeten tea
rip
Typically reserved for survival situations or bedrooms
salt diabeetus
That has terrible implications
*chug chug chug chug*
NO
Please don't drink straight soy sauce
anything is a drink if you try hard enough
That's a sauce tho
.... soy sauce?
rip?
You ever find it weird that all of human history has never been able to make a savory drink?
S a l t y  t e a
it's like salty tea
Ok lmao good
no
Do you still drink the eggy tea though?
I feel like Alan would enjoy this
it's p good
Is it good?
you crack the shells a bit and the tea seeps in
I've never seen that
like when you hard boil eggs and just leave them to sleep in tea
Spill the tea
Wdym?
my parents just do tea eggs
rip
My family marinates hard-boiled eggs in soy sauce, and I just cannot eat that stuff
boiled eggs are prob the worst offender but i dunk that shit in pepper and soy sauce
Valid
Oh ok
Like some pepper or paprika or something else you haven't tried
sorry dude i'm lazy
Maybe you need to cook your eggs differently to get rid of that taste
f indeed
F
now i'm traumatized and i have egg issues
yeah so
That sounds really rough
I did a week of it last week. I don't think I could handle 3 weeks
i had to take that shit for 3 weeks when i had pneumonia
Your egg reading: you're a bit of a mess, but your personality has a lot of layers
and it's fucking disgusting
there's this one kind of amoxicillin that tastes a lot like egg whites
whatttt
W h a t
reminds me of antibiotics
but i hate the taste of straight egg whites
Some people read tea leaves, but I read eggs
my body is willing to accept fried/scrambled eggs
I feel like this says a lot about a person
Scrambled? Easy over?
How do you like your eggs?
C a r b o h y d r a t e s
but eggs are super hit and miss for me
potat is good
P o t a t o
E g g s
i just don't like most breakfast foods
i usually don't eat breakfast
rip
I don't usually eat lunch, so the obvious solution here is to potato until dinner time
so lunchtime is usually my boundary
I woke up at 10
well i usually wake up 8-9
That's oddly specific, but that also makes sense
4 hours is where i draw the line
How long is it socially acceptable to just potato in bed for?
lol all good
But I also told him to just come back for me later, so I was kinda aware I kinda couldn't do it
Which was silly
A degree of pride
Ok, I had like
Let's like never carry this much stuff this far ever again
noah said he offered to help but you were being stubborn
ye i saw
Jarrett basically had to run back and help me after he finished
agreed lol
Smart
i said no
noah tried to make me do that on the first carry trip
it's okay
I had trouble carrying the two bundles of firewood, so I'm p sure I'm the weak one
A bit more than that tbh
i'm just fucking weak
some guys helped us
lol i carried it for like a block and a half
Although thanks though
Sorry for making y'all carry the cooler
Oof, damn, I didn't realize
no bueno
and then we were carrying shit
noah and i worked arms friday night
:/
i'm more sore than yesterday
How are you doing?
oki
But I'm laying in bed and hugging a pillow, so there's not really much more I can ask for
rip
I'm still a little sore from being weak yet trying to carry as much stuff as Noah and Jarrett
I'm doing aight I guess
you ok?
rip
aw
I'm gonna have a fun time explaining to my roommate next year why I just sometimes need a day to lay in bed all day and have a crisis lmao
bleach
You can eat anything as long as you don't mind diarrhea
If you're lactose intolerant you can eat cheese and yogurt
It's a big change
I feel you
but i'm def sad about it
i'm just being dramatic
You holding up alright?
actual mourning
i'm in like
I'm so sorry
Damn
ice cream
but also
tbh I barely eat dairy anyways
I expect it to happen to me but it hasn't started yet as far as I can tell
damn
fite me
i will eat cheese
well fuck my dysfunctional enzymes
._.
Oh noooooo
big fucking SAD
i am becoming lactose intolerant
i think
wholesome
p sure she hasn't actually updated her website in at least a year
lol she'll be flattered
context: https://helenwang.myportfolio.com/places
she's like an actual pro
you're right
shit
she's a way better photographer than me and also does a lot of cool outdoors shit
@rhymeswmelon
you should follow my sister on insta
every weekend there's a 33% chance she's on some mountain somewhere
I think you would get along with her
oh that's awesome
she also climbed Fuji while in Japan
lol
I don't believe her
she tells me it's the last thing she wants to do before she has kids
My brain is ded
my sis did rainier like 2 years ago? I just need to be 18
fun
oh nice lol
and that recommends all the hikes to me lol
she's the one that climbed Rainier
my cousin Chin wants to do the entire PCT in like 2021
i think my knees just cried out in pain at that statement
have fun guys
then maybe PCT
damn
scratch that, all mountain tops in WA/OR states
ok I also wanna summit rainier next summer
if at all
rainier first
put it this way
valid
but a good portion of it maybe
I'm not sure about *the actual entire thing*
I mean yes but not that way
are you sure dying alone isn't on your bucket list
rip
AND I NEED FRIENDS I'D PROBABLY DIE ALONE
BUT THAT'S DEFINITELY ON MY BUCKET LIST OK
the one vB is doing
from *mexico* to *canada*
yes I know
the one that goes
the *entire pct*
NEXT MONTH
i thought you were gonna be like
oh phew
😄
*oh no*
some *month*?
you mean
someday?
and i ain't as spry as i used to be lol
but my knees can still be a bit hit and miss
i'm down for some hiking though
do you wanna do the whole pct someday
alan
wait ok
okay maybe not the entire thing
gl
.... rip
let's do the entire PCT
you have no idea
dude I'm so fucking down
Ok, go to the gym more, I would not
fuck it <@!503787499605458954> let's go on a month long backpacking trip
... and then the gym is closed all week
I'd probably be doing U101 and some game development if I weren't in constant pain
i was planning to go to the gym more
I fucking cleaned my room
I was actually being social and organized after graduation
list of things <@!478706068223164416> should do
1) Learn more Japanese
2) Work out more
3) Go outside (hike, friends, idk anything)
4) Go to work (not under your control)
but it takes a lot of effort to make myself Do Things
rip desk
I get really competitive once I get into it
same w gaming
then I get sucked in
like I know I adore reading but picking up and starting books is by far the most tedious part to me
By many I mean any
Same, I haven't read many of the books I put on my list
I feel like I'm like this @ a lot of things though
I haven't actually accomplished many things I meant to
All that means is you're not as into gaming as you wanted to be
though I've been exercising, cooking, hiking, and reading a lot
that's my current state if it makes you feel any better
Hhhhj
I was like "I'm gonna get back into gaming this summer" but I've been too lazy to clear a space on my desk LMAO
Retirement would suck
Me, prior to grad: Imagine all the productive things I could do with enough free time
Me, with enough free time: Wow, I can do so much shit? But why now? Gotta pace myself to recover from what was probably burnout. I have all summer.
Wisdom teeth: Lol no you don't
and partying a lot
given I have been doing productive stuff
I've gone to bed at reasonable times because I RAN OUT OF THINGS TO DO
now here I am barely able to keep myself not bored from hour to hour
near the end of senior year my biggest complaint was "I could be spending my time doing more productive stuff like working"
That sounds valid, but I'm being instructed to chug 16 ibuprofen pills a day, and that's funnier in concept than guessing how much aspirin I need
I personally like aspirin more than ibuprofen.
Mr. 2 day brainwave
And the day before
Well it was nice yesterday
it's nast
have you looked outside
You been outside recently?
it's been hurting for the last two days
na was hurting way before that
I feel like that was a detrimental action to take if your head was hurting
Have you tried not playing starcraft for like 2 hours?
Hopefully you feel better soon though.
Sorry, fam. Idk what else to tell you.
If it's not working, maybe drink some water and try to get some sleep
Hm
Excedrin specifically
Wdym?
basically
Have you tried ibuprofen yet?
horrible headache
no clue
How come?
my head hurts
no
<@193229269076279298>
You alright?
possible my own
I wish to end someone existence
head has felt like it's splitting open for the last two days
Not be in pain
To like
I'm popping pills
The answer is me
Hey, all. What's poppin'?
I'll be alright. I'm just complaining.
ah im sorry gene
It fucking hurts to laugh. This is the worst.
Its always sad boi hours
i.e r/inceltears
now that sounds downright poisonous
angry men hours
angry man hours
ANGRY BOI HOURS
sounds cursed
sad man hours
*man
*boi
also why sad boy hours?
and it is?
After three months of intensive research I have finally decided on one (1) piece of tech I will be bringing to college
If it's carpeted, it can be
Wouldn't it be better to sleep on regular flat floor?
On the stairs? I can't imagine in what universe that it's comfortable
I've def done it before
As long as it's comfortable at least
We stan
ngl kinda wanna try sleeping on the stairway
I love that
Awww that's so wholesome
still pretty tho
wait that's the light from the neighbor's house
the moonlight is pretty
Awww, that's nice to hear
pretty good I'd say
had a bowl of chicken noodle soup for dinner at 10
just got back from Helen's grad party
How are you doing?
sitting on the stairwell in the dark AMA
I'd be willing to bet a fair amount that he's had a similar thought at some point in his life
And before you say that this is a dumb question
If Kevin Bacon eats pork, is it considered cannibalism?
Me: Why fill the void inside my soul? Lying in bed and watching YouTube videos all day is great! Who needs human contact, social interaction, and success in life?

Me: Oh yeah...

many sites are guilty of this, but one that I find does it the most is reddit, specifically the subreddits surrounding dating advice and relationships. if you browse through the popular posts, and look through the popular comments, most of the time the solution found in those threads goes something like "break their fucking kneecaps" or "break up with them a shit all over their belongings". these comments aren't actually offering realistic solutions, those comments are drowned out by the pandering, karma-whoring drama queen comments that aim to appeal to the masses' need for vigilante justice and bloodlust for revenge. therefore, the most popular suggestions found in these kinds of reddits aren't actually the ones that will help whoever is asking for advice, they're the ones who're appealing to the audience's senses of vengeance and self righteousness.

this is one isolated case, and it's on the internet for christ's sake, but it's important to take into account that this can, and has, happened before. the horrendous things that have occurred at the hands of an angry mob, witch hunting, attacks on minorities, all of it done by the more "popular" group abusing their position as the majority to fulfill their bloodlust or need for a scapegoat. a human's animalistic instinct to follow the herd and bandwagon on popular ideology is a dangerous one, and is one that leads to extremism and prejudice.

just because something is popular, well liked, or is the most agreed upon, doesn't necessarily mean it's right.
just because you're popular doesn't mean you're right

it's a given that, in most situations, if a conflict is ever to arise, the side with the majority of people on it is usually declared as the "right" or "winning" side. this kind of thinking only works so long as the people in the "majority" aren't hive-minded dumbasses. luckily enough for you, you'll be able to find masses upon masses of hive-minded dumbasses in just a few clicks given the power of everyone's favorite idiot amplifying device: the internet!
boi
use your words
explain
😠
why can't we use this channel?
<@258094439636008971>
I'll write the rant if the channel is created
We only look back and say a popular opinion was not right because it's no longer popular
Generally the majority does
But who gets to decide right?
and my personal favorite, "just because your opinion is popular doesn't mean it's right"
***E X C U S E  M E ? ?***
"the louder a man the smaller his confidence"
other talks include "glasses doesn't equal smart, sincerely, a dumbass with glasses"
mmh death
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HIZAkDbC5g&t=1201s
Ngl I used to dislike some things for being popular
<@258094439636008971> pls
*i'm not like other girls* vibes
TRUE
Lol sure let's have a channel for rants
a ted talk
ah
with a short tangent on "let people enjoy things"
my first one will be entitled "hating popular things is not a personality"
I want an angry boi hours channel for my late night hysterical rants
That makes sense to be tbh
Valid
in that cause I'd prob just call it emotionally exhausting if both good and bad were intense and average if they weren't
I've had a pretty good day to clarify. I've just been wondering.
This is more of a hypothetical
In theory
What if they're equal?
depends on the degree of good vs. bad
oof
Is a day that rapidly vacilltes between good and bad things still a good day or bad day overall? Cuz it feels weird to call it average
Not sure if allergies or getting sick (probably the former), but today's been miserable in that regard
No worries
Thanks Gene
Hey, I know I'm over three hours too late, but I hope things are alright. I'm here for you as well, Jane.
thank you ❤
night
and g'night
well, good luck
and dream about something other than my death
i'll watch some friends and try to go to sleep again
ah no you should sleep
love you I'm here (for now, I might also fall asleep) if you need me  or wanna chat lol
and try to get some more sleep
maybe read something or watch something for a bit to take your mind off it
try to keep that in mind, I guess, I always try to just remind myself of that
but you are safe
how you feel is v valid and nightmares are freaky
it's 3:30 am and we're derping on discord
but hey
that's intense
oof
and he had one friend (who's one of my coworkers but i actually like him) who was like convinced that i had wronged the stalker and came by to yell at me sometimes
and there was one time i was by the roundabout in issaquah near target and the guy was yelling at me and then i see up ahead the stalker has come to get me
it's kind of blurry why but then the guy doing the brutalizing started stalking me and trying to kill me and he told me that i better never be by myself or he'd find me
I was in my car at night listening to someone getting beaten up
do you wanna talk about it?
ooof
i had a nightmare and i'm really freaked out now
at 3:39 am i was fucking mad that cutting out small cat eyes was a pain in the ass
lol
This is a big sad moment
God damn it why don't I live in California
It's 3:36 AM and I have a sudden craving for In-N-Out again
You guys really made my senior year everything I've ever asked for and more. Thank you guys for helping make me the person I am today over all these years and giving a year worth remembering.
I'm not sure if I made a significant contribution, but I'd say senior year is pretty special
hi i’m in soft boi hours rn so i just wanted to thank you guys for making my senior year so memorable and fun. y’all made me feel loved and that’s all i really needed this year.
dammit i didn't remember that all finals are on the same day lol
I was gonna
group final
cant
no legit i'm thinking of skipping physics
L
this is true though
thanks
It's ok you're already broken
I'm running on 4 hours of sleep and 4 shots of espresso
and did physics and tok during school tomorrow
what if I just slept
oof!
hello I am like on the verge of complete breakdown!
<@340319804747415553> everything alright?
never apparently
at what point is it too early for sadboi hours
:/
awww i'm sorry
i am a sad
my internet ends in 6 minutes
Still feel dead
I just took a nap
how is it only 9:50 I'm so fucking exhausted
i feel like absolute shit right now, and i have no idea what's happening or why
Lol
yea that's super normal for me lol
no dota at 1 is really just a daily occurence for me
o shit we up to 8 now
ah, yes. it truly is a three-day weekend
lowkey in hell over here
bruh my internet is so slow rn for some reason
Is the move to actually sleeping for once or stay up until 4 playing video games and going through Reddit?
lol i guess we're in the general channel now
im here for y'all if ya need me
yep
is it sad boi hrs yet?
Face-to-face interaction be like that
... rip?
Wow, having an hour of face to face interaction with a human just made my raging headache go away
hey, that's my line
And I usually don’t bite
thank you. i really appreciate that.
I know that feeling
Well if you need someone to talk to, I’m here
Ah
i have not been doing too great recently, but it's mainly just me being a dramatic bitch that's overamplifying my problems inside my head lol
Why?
Ah
my reflection looks like it's seen a ghost tbh
How’re you doing dude
i will indeed send virtual hugs then
i'm sorry
Not much you can do
Idk lol
Send digital hugs
is there anything we could do to help?
showing up to the ER if it continues might make sense
Mmh fair call
Avoid dairy and gluten for now
If it persists I’m seriously considering showing up to urgent care and being like yo it’s not appendicitis but I still feel like I’m dying
Barely noticeable yesterday
It didn’t get bad till this afternoon
if it's been 48 hours, that's kinda concerning
maybe you should see someone about it?
Now is the wow your intestines fucking hate you part
Prom was like the acid reflux part
damn, that long?
maybe you caught something over the weekend
It started after dancing at prom and then just kinda ramped up since
It could also just be anatomical stupidity
yike
I can’t tell
Prom food?
And I’d rather not risk it because I’ve also been feeling pretty nauseous
No
do you have any carbonated drinks?
hydration sounds smart though
oof i'm sorry
I don’t exactly have laxatives and painkillers in the house
Been trying to stay hydrated
have you taken something for it yet?
Rip
honest, i skipped today and promised myself i'd spend the day working but spent 15 minutes actually being productive
Came home and still felt like dying
Felt like dying
went to work
aww, i'm sorry
Originally meant to study tonight
And I wanna curl up and just die
I have the shittiest stomach ache rn
Sure
Would anyone like to screech into the void together?
<@520095106888630348> lemme know if you're still down for some dream analysis cuz I think I seriously might need some
It expanded upon the Gene Dreamatic Universe, but I don't remember the details of the last one, cuz it wasn't nearly as traumatizing
Fell asleep again
Oh my God today's high temperature here is the low temperature at Durham 😰
Dammit this means I need to study again :(
I fully expected and looked forward to waking up at 2
This feels weird to say but why am I awake at 11
I will absolutely analyze your dreams
I feel perfectly fine. I got like 5 hours of sleep
I'm gonna try to sleep
Sorry, I'm fucking delirious at the moment. Four hours of broken sleep and two nightmares after prom night does not leave you in the most rested state.
Everyone in the prom group was in at least one of them, so there's major fucking tea that could be spilled, but I'm also honestly just so bothered by one of them that I simultaneously feel I shouldn't talk about it but need to so I'm not scarred for life. But I also can't/shouldn't talk about it with several different people here cuz it's really personal.
Also, I just thought of this, but if you guys wanna try to do a dream analysis thing again, you're either gonna have to dm me or make a smaller group chat because I'm just not comfortable with everyone hearing some of this, so maybe I really just shouldn't. I feel like I really need to tho, cuz I haven't been this shook in a super long time.
I'm honestly terrified to go back to sleep
One of them felt so realistic it hurt. I had some intense arguments and rant sessions, and I was so ready for more
I've already woken up in a cold sweat twice from two really believable post-prom situation nightmares
I haven't been able to sleep in larger increments than two hours
Oh my gosh
feliz cumpleanos a tiiii
Tanks.
hey, happy birthday!!
I share my birthday with Minecraft?
Ooooo I'd be down to do that tonight
We should play the free old school mine craft that's online for the anniversary
Fam, Minecraft is 10 years old now. Anyone wanna play some  M i n e c r a f t  later tonight?
https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/about-us/our-work
I don't know if this will help but probably doesn't hurt to give them a call
I have to agree with Jane on this one
I would strongly suggest getting professional help
yea I don't have any more actual advice rip
rip
i probably have
she has
like in here
yeah i think you've talked about it before
i've had this problem for a solid 1.5 years now and for a while i was so angry with myself and desperately wanted to improve but didn't make real progress
been a lot better about eating since working out more consistently but there's still some bumps in the road
i'm holding up okay mostly
... oofs
to be honest, not really
ok
aww are yall like
*who needs extra mental capacity*
well it seems like you're doing fine with juggling most things tbh
rip
the thought of food takes up so much mental capacity
*time to go terrorize the world instead*
honestly i wish i could feel that way more
cool i'm not hungry anymore
i'm like
but i feel like i never really appreciated it to the level that you and cindy do
i mean food is good
hahaha
other 10% is i just love food lmao
r i p
i attribute it 90% to stress due to academic lifestyle
L
which is partially true
U H
....
true; i'll just say i paid to get into duke by getting an eating disorder
you wouldn't have gotten in
can't have everything
like if you were a perfectly average normal joe
that's fair
going to duke isn't
going to college is the norm
*coughs in college*
you're paying a lot to not be normal
well
i would pay a lot to be normal
. - .
*normal is overrated*
i guess that's fair
*no one gets to be normal*
...woo
like just average the two of us out and you have perfectly normal healthy people
good question
man why can't we all just be normal
i have to remind myself to eat
i have like the opposite problem with food
oofs
binge eating disorder
BED?
?
BED is real 😦
.... rip
as for the second part, i'm the fattest person in my family now
lol well jeremy just casually says "i'm fat" all the time randomly, it's pretty funny
all of it?
which part? jeremy or the being fat part?
lol what
and while i'm in sad boi hrs, i'll quote jeremy: i'm fat 😦
i see
the entire store is dedicated to shiny accessories, purses etc
it's called charming charlie's i think, if you want to go take a look
no i got them from a store in rtc
go amazon?
i bought them for the necklace but here's hoping i can use the earrings too
did you get a legit set or like
rip earrings tho
aw that's nice
i did get a pretty earring + necklace set for prom today
LOL what a *rebel*
i like got cheap earrings on amazon for prom so maybe i'll join you in the "my ear is ready to fall off" boat by the end
but i think it will be fine
doc told me to not wear earrings at all and i'm blatantly disobeying them
sounds like it sucks
hang in there bud
rip you
yeah that's where the lymph node is
ah
it's halfway down my neck now
anyway the infection is there now and it hurts to turn my neck too far
yes there is a lymph node in the general vicinity
ah
unless i got anatomy wrong
the little thingy behind your ear is the lymph node right
necesito saber mas
like sintomas por favor
what do you mean by it spread to a lymph node
i've had some on and off ear infections but it has never been *that* bad
i did try to wash it with peroxide though and i feel like that contributed
the infection was because of the ear piercing, but i'm not exactly sure why bc it was completely fine for several weeks
jk jk sorry love you helen
*and then it was all downhill from there*
Is everything alright?
once i got sick when i was nine or something and got prescribed penicillin
Holy shit damn
what happened?!?
actual yikes
y i  k e
.
|
.
but you prob know that
i went to the doctor and got prescribed strong antibiotics
that'll speed up the process
uh i'd say try disinfecting it and keeping it dry
i just can't with the lash band on the ones i have
i might need to make an emergency run for new falsies
.... o o f s :(
guess i probably can't wear earrings to prom 😦
i have an infection on my ear and it reached my lymph node
Thanks
hang in there!
aw rip jane :(
Try to get some rest and drink some water so you can get well soon for exams
:/
Aww, I'm sorry
I am sick
Big sad guys
me
but yes
mid-winter
F
we stan climate change
do you guys remember when spring was longer than 3 weeks?
i can't do late-night homework without hearing a bunch of annoying-ass, horny frogs outside
i hate spring
me: i just closed a bunch of tabs. wow, it's all so clean now.
chrome's screaming: *send help, i'm still running 15 tabs. i just counted*
me: life now even sounds as peaceful as it looks too. this is blissful.
F
there's also a hilarious bit of editing in the middle where she's like "lol what is mixing colors"
because it's glorious
why would you make me watch those 20 seconds of horror
it's good if you wanna relive the post-hoco party trauma
i love the intro to this vid ngl
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvxigTjnH70
youtube is a beautiful hell hole for sad boi hours
i mean
thank you tho. appreciate the effort
something to watch during not sad boi hours
i mean, that's a bit of a mood, but not like sad boi hours content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihCl_IYjrFg
try this
or something like that
i think it was the universe in four minutes
which video was it?
wasnt exactly sad boi hours content for me tho
i watched a video
what dis
start anywhere
https://www.youtube.com/user/willunicycleforfood/videos
crushing
nothing like
just a mild sad boi mood
gene, you doing ok?
what's exurb1a
idk, have you started watching exurb1a videos yet
is it sad boi hours yet?
if there's anything at all we can do for you, don't ever hesitate to let us know. we're your friends and always willing to listen and do the best thing for you
we're proud of you and lucky to have you, cindy
thank you ❤
also, idk if that helps, cuz again, different things work for different people, but i hope that kinda makes some sense
idk if that makes any sense cuz i'm not the most eloquent person in the world, but what i'm trying to say is that you do amazing things every day and deserve better, but it's ok to remember that you're ultimately still just a single person. don't be ashamed of it, but take pride in it
you work hard every day and hold yourself to a high standard, but that's not a standard that always have to be there. don't view the times when you're not feeling great, need to crash, or just are feeling sad as a mistake. those kinds of things just usually mean something else needs to change, not necessarily those warning signs
i wouldn't hold that against yourself. sure, if it impedes with your health, it's problematic, but don't assume that it's wrong when you "give up and sleep." it's usually a symptom of another problem and not something you should innately hate. i'm not qualified to give you a psychoanalysis, but just remind yourself that you do the things that you do because you're a human being with limitations and just sometimes needs a break. if that's a problem, then there's a shit ton more wrong with this world than we think there is
idk man I used to be able to just work nonstop from when I got home, half the time now I just give up and sleep
no, you don't. you just sound human. it's ok
fuck, I sound so emo
I feel like I'm still dealing with the same stuff, but my ability to cope w shit has just decreased dramatically. my day-to-day life feels so meaningless 90% of the time
I joke about this kinda shit all the time and it is funny to be like why am I like this when I can't bring myself to get anything done at 3 am
we all kinda need those moments from time to time. it's healthy if anything.
but remember that if you ever need to talk to someone who won't judge you for it, hold it against you, have it change their opinion of you, etc., there are plenty of people in you life, myself included, who would be more than happy to listen if you just need a moment
different things work for different people
it's hard. i wouldn't hold it against yourself too hard.
idk how to stop pretending I'm okay lmao
it's really no problem
it means a lot
thanks
is there anything i could do to help? even if you just wanna go off, i'm here to listen
i can definitely see why that would be a concern. a lot of parents are really detached about it, so i don't blame you. i'm sorry. this is way more of a mess than you deserve
I dunno man I tend to be super private about mental health, I've always felt that my parents never understood, tried to understand, or took it seriously
damn
“Hi u alive?”
it's bc I missed an email, they wouldn't normally, I just forgot to respond so I think they got worried or smth
sounds like your mom needs to chill tho
i'm really surprised they actually sent you something tho
yikes, i'm sorry. i hope things work out
OOOF
hopefully things will be ok
idk my mom's being really invasive about it, my dad kinda waved her off for now tho
are things with your parents ok at the moment or are they still upset?
i'm sorry. that's really shitty for your parents to lose it over that
idk how to even respond, like on one hand I know they're worried, on the other hand there's a reason I didn't tell them anything
woah, what? damn, why the hell
annnnnd that's how they found out I've been seeing skyline's mental health counselor for weeks, and they flipped their shit
my parents being my parents they opened it anyway
basically, I got a letter today that had a giant red "CONFIDENTIAL" stamp on it
uh
lol don't apologize you responded in like 3 mins
sorry, just saw this
is everything alright? wanna talk about it?
surprise
upset for reasons unrelated to endgame
I'm
welp
rip
My "quick half-hour nap" ended up being 2.5 hours
oh, awesome! congrats. get some rest then
but good luck to whatever poor souls are laboring on this fell night
gonna get some sweet sweet sleep
just finished!
nope
anyone else grinding homework on this lovely sunday night?
It's gonna work out great
Sounds awesome! Congrats, Jiayi!
I'll watch my email in case I have to do something about that one event, but hopefully my supervisor just deletes it for me
One thing off my back!
I guess in a sense I'm done with cas now, all my evidence and reflections are all done and my cas project is done
No worries. Just don't stress about it and watch your email
Thanks gene
Ah thank god
If there's a flaw AND IB chooses to randomly audit yours (so very unlikely to begin with), he might get dinged for it himself, but if you meet all the minimum requirements, cw's prolly safe and IB turns a blind eye
Cw doesn't send CAS to IB. He checks it off himself
Don't worry
The way the whole completion system works makes it feel like control of the entire process is out of our hands
This is also dumb, why can't we delete activities marked as complete ourselves
If the event doesn't get deleted and Wilder sends my cas to IB and it has one activity without evidence/supervisor review that doesn't invalidate my whole cas right?
Everything else is done and uploaded for cas
Yup I just told her that, hopefully she pulls through
Do it like now, and that's about as much as you can do
When you email your parent adviser, just say, "hey, everything done is done except this because I could get a review. Could you delete it for me and check off everything else?"
Focus on getting everything done
If you can live without it, I wouldn't worry about it
Snow shovelling for my neighbors
What was the activity?
It's an activity I can live without
I really hate what CAS does with the whole "you can't change a completed event" thing
What was it?
Nope
Do you have another form of evidence?
I hate this
Then don't worry about it for now
And I can't delete the activity when it's marked complete either
Can't go back and add the email and I can't get an activity supervisor review without the email in there
Issue is that I just noticed I forgot to write down an email for one of my events, and it's marked as complete now
Boi
Had to have it done tonight
Scrambling to get CAS done rn
That’s bc all the sad has been college related
Notice how we haven't had to use the sad boi hours channel since break started
Yeah, I'm doing better now. Just been busy. Thanks for asking.
Are you doing alright?
Lmao.
Oh boy. Everything was a mistake.
Life would be so much easier is I just never got headaches
Aw Cindy I’m sorry :(
Awww, I'm sorry, Cindy.
:(( i’m sorry
like I can't tell if it's bc people around me aren't pulling as much weight or if bc I just got that much less capable of doing things when it comes to convention planning
I'm genuinely unsure how I degenerated so much
this week has been nothing but suffering and I didn't even get rejected anywhere lmao
eh it's fine
im sorry. i have trouble not feeling sympathetic when it's uncalled for.
a lot of people appreciate that kind of support but i honestly don't care much for it
but don't worry about it, thanks
look gene, i appreciate the concern
you deserve rest too
aww, salina...
lol
rest is for the people who don't take four hour naps to avoid dealing with their problems
please try your best to take some time for yourself and get some rest
im sorry
i'm aware
that's not always healthy
and i've had my own mental health issues here and there but i generally keep my mouth fucking shut about it
try to get some rest
college admissions was such an L of so many levels
salina...
mostly
lol i'm fine
is everything alright?
maybe it's clinical depression
maybe she's born with it
maybe it's senioritis
or...
like
don't want to deal with it
but rn i just
stay strong. it's almost break
eh i think i got things under control
good luck
oof
that's a later problem tho
i also need to like... make up a business quiz at some point lol
i don't wanna deal with math and bio
i will prob skip tomorrow honestly
mood
ooof
i lowkey feel super disoriented right now, and i just want to skip tomorrow. not skip school but skip existing.
L
lol no
Who knows? Maybe you can start a new fashion trend.
O o f
i now only have half a pair of dramatic falsies lmfaoooo
and my dad just dumped one of those lashes down the sink on accident
i had a pair of false lashes that i wore to tolo soaking in a cup of micellar water so i could get the glue off
What's wrong?
Awww, I'm sorry, Salina
but like lmao i am both much sad and dying laughing
Everything alright?
sorry to be dramatic
god
my
oh
It's a university college

^_^
:3
:3
:3
this is utter blasphemy
one does not lightly use the :3 face
👀
i typed the colon then randomly smashed a key
idk why i used that emoji
:3
oh god did you really just
no problem :3
much love
thanks guys y'alls advice has been helpful
alright I don't really want my random angst to take up more of your time lmao
wao
you've had "real social interaction" for maybe 3 years
and you're not supposed to yet
lol the edit
I just don't always know how
I will try to be better in the meantime I guess
i'm not worried
sorry if it sounds bad but it's because i believe you can do it
don't worry about it honestly I'll pull myself out of it
I'm just in early sadboi hours
i definitely understand how navigating relations to other people can be difficult
ha like you said it's not your responsibility
i think i'm doing the same thing as you did, trying to help someone while having no experience myself
no it's all good, thanks anyways
but right here isn't the best place for me to operate sorry
if you want to talk about this privately, i'll talk it out with you
oof sorry
and this is just too reminiscent of other things i've dealt with
which is what this group chat is
i've just realized that when it comes to supporting people, i am terrible at it in a group setting
no, it's fine
sorry for unloading all my shit
sorry
fair enough
this really isn't good for me rn
i think i'm gonna drop out of this convo tho
ok I feel like salina has definitely seen Cindy the Trainwreck in action more lol and the reason I brought this up in the first place is bc I'm worried I do this kinda shit too often
it can be improved with practice
social skill is also a skill
it just means this is something you're currently bad at, and you can improve on it
it's like one death is a tragedy, 1000 is a statistic
there's a point where it's no longer an accident and it's just a habit/pattern
When i say "it's not your responsibility" i also don't mean that you shouldn't involve yourself in these situations, just that you shouldn't be expected to be perfect
just because it's normal doesn't mean that it's okay if it consistently happens
devil's advocate argument here
it's normal to make mistakes like that
i'm not saying that it not being your fault makes everything better. What I think is that it isn't your responsibility or moral obligation to do all of that, so when you do it, it shouldn't be expected that you can handle the situation perfectly
so my judgment on this is def skewed
then again, i don't deal with personal issues like other people do tbh
i personally don't agree with ` they're going to subconsciously expect you to only say things that make them feel better` but i think it's just an overgeneralization for the sake of explanation
interesting perspective but it takes two to tango, idk if trying to absolve me of blame really helps things lol, and that's not the only situation my general statement about accidentally hurting people applies to
correct me if i'm wrong on anything
what this means is you're often not emotionally compatible to the person you're trying to help, and this does not mean you lack empathy because you certainly don't
But you're your own person with your own way of handling things, and I agree that the way you think is not always "mainstream" or malleable to many different personalities
you're not a professional counselor, you don't have the training of one to handle delicate situations. You're a normal friend. If they are emotionally vulnerable and somehow perceives you as someone they can rely on for support, they're going to subconsciously expect you to only say things that make them feel better
??
i can explain why
in that case i don't think it's your fault
lol
anyway
maybe i should just use "hurt"
i just don't have a good word for it
yeah i get that
less butthurt, more genuinely hurt
hm "offend" might not be the right word
so generally the people you accidentally offend and feel bad about are also the people who get emotional help from you
and generally, yes
same question
1 comes to mind and that's luke brandes
well, that then
just stuff I feel shitty about afterwards
oh this isn't usually relationship-destroying stuff
are any of the ruined friendships with people you had to help in this way?
apparently I give good advice, which I think is deeply ironic
this is true
i think once you said to me that for some reason a lot of people come to you with their issues so you get involved in helping people with their drama, or playing counselor?
forget about possible sociopathy for a moment, you're a person who sometimes struggles with navigating personal interactions and accidentally offends people
seems like the situation you just described feels like a branch rather than main issue
(if this is even accurate; we don't know yet and it's probably not necessary to know too much about)
and a bunch of branches underneath
lol sounds about right
like there is one overarching issue
i'm imagining a tree of issues
I guess?
then is that a specific, if not main, issue?
I'm not sure what my main issue is
so would you say your main issue is knowing how to read close situations better?
conscience, idk
I don't think I necessarily lack empathy
I joke a lot about being an emotionally stunted asshole but the thing is it's really true, I feel like it's pretty telling when the people I get along w best are just the people it's near-impossible to genuinely offend
lol this past year has kind of just highlighted how despite being good at stuff like networking n shit, and despite generally being pretty good at reading people, I can be really fucking inept at actually navigating close personal relationships?? like I'll do something that hurts someone and I'll know they're upset but then it's kinda difficult for me to pinpoint where exactly I went wrong, I often need someone to explicitly lay it out before I get it and can correct it, which pisses me off/make me feel like a piece of shit bc I always feel like I should've known better I guess
i agree lol
i think shes typing something very long
it is lack of conscience or empathy or like something in between
what are you specifically concerned about
but i'm with helen
if you think something could have a negative impact, it's good to clarify
and part of it is being assertive about it
nah I'm fine w it being here
actions have consequences and even though we can take things/impacts for granted, it's good to stay keyed in to what those actions can mean/do
and you canmove to a private chat if you don't want everything here
not just "sociopathy" in general because we don't know much about that
that at the bottom line, it's important to have respect of both other people and your own actions
like an example of a certain situation
first of all, what specifically are you concerned about?
i think
bc I'm kinda at a loss and that's the part that scares me
throw it out there, I'm not gonna be hurt/offended, I just wanna Know
i keep thinking of things to say, but i don't have the right ways to say them
I don't know if this applies to your situation specifically but i know this is generally true whenever you're trying to stop a certain habit in your mind
it takes practice to catch that thought and stop it
the thought is very small and takes a fraction of a second to process
every time you do something seemingly automatically, you do have a conscious thought go through your brain that tells you "I'm going to do this"
but eventually you might end up better at considering your actions
you'll probably fail a lot
it's hard to fight against instinct
i don't know specific examples of what you do, but the general idea is try to notice when you're about to do something compulsively and eventually learn to fight against it
how do I improve on that though
not just you, but just general context
something about this deeply bothers me
i would love to be supportive, but idk
no I really appreciate it
i'm sorry, just trying to be honest
and i don't know if i would say you totally take charge of it either
i don't think you are totally conscious of the implications of your actions
yes
If you're not, and you care about it, you can work towards it
do you want an honest answer
sorry guys I'm having one of my first public existential crises rip
...
am I though?
I think what matters more is that you are conscious of how your actions affect other people and take charge of it
A lot of people who are completely "normal" have a lot of despicable traits. Being a sociopath doesn't necessarily make you a worse person because your sociopathy would be a mild version, within the acceptable range of normal personalities
and regardless of what you've done in the past, we're still here to support you
that's an understandable and respectable fear, but remember that you've also done a lot of good things in your life too
you're right but the possibility still kinda freaks me out, idk man, I've accidentally fucked w a lot of people and my own life is lowkey a flaming pile of trash so
In what way is it not part of personality?
well idk if i agree that it's a personality thing, but it ultimately doesn't change who you are
It is only a description of a trait, it doesn't create any meaning itself
Try not to think too much about it; it's just a term to describe a certain kind of personality
regardless of where you're at, you're still our friend and a wonderful person, and nothing can really change that. we're here for you
I think an estimated 4% of the US is sociopathic
have things been fine
^
A lot of sociopaths live completely normal lives, so I think if things have been fine up until now there is no reason for having that definition to change anything
no it's all good lol to be clear I visited for mental health reasons and not bc I wanted to ask if I'm a sociopath
i'm sorry
ah
she's there for mental health not psychological evaluations
I've talked to summer
again, there is the skyline thing that would be free and really lowkey (like no parent or skyline involvement)
but i'm not surprised
damn actual rip
we're here for you to talk to
it's alright
I'm being a dramatic lil shit sorry y'all
so I guess I'll just have to wait and wonder
there's no way my parents would agree to fund this kind of thing
rip?
and also v busy
poor
lol u right but I am
it might be best to consider speaking with a professional or someone more familiar with this kind of thing if you're concerned?
are you a sociopath
hm
ah silicon valley
ok I'm aware that I'm not in the best headspace rn so this is probably a dumb freakout but I've thought about it before and it's very possible. does that actually mean anything? idk
what if I am???
am I a sociopath?????????????
this is super random but I've kinda been in depresso mode and I was reading about the elizabeth holmes case and now I'm super paranoid
L?
-Gabe
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee why kid play game 😠 😠 😠 😠 😠
Fortnite's a decent game, and I respect it for what it is (despite being flawed, it has a lot going for it). However, it's a meme, and the Fortnite community is the Fortnite community
you've played?
y'all are just mean
fortnite is fucking fun
Very true
at least it's not fortnite
I occasionally get the urge to play Minecraft
however i occasionally get the urge to play webkinz
no i do not get the urge to play hide and seek
1. Where's Waldo is hide and seek for people who don't have any friends.
2. Does anyone else ever get the sudden urge to play hide and seek but then remember they're going to college next year?
idk!
but still
I just called and they said I'm probably fine
Deadline is time received or time postmarked?
in time
I have no idea if he actually sent them
2 weeks ago
I asked wilder like
How do they anticipate your ib grades
the deadline is tomorrow
they only take them by mail
but
basically I need to send them ib anticipated grades
Lol
I meant to put this in college apps lmao
Canada?
oh wait wrong channel
bruh canada is stressing me out
L
For a while earlier this year I had a nasty habit of just passing out at my desk at some point
Loool
Sometimes late at night I'm done with everything and am really tired but am too lazy to move to my bed
If I were that tired I would never be able to get my ass up to exercise
We live sad lives
Last time I went climbing I also almost fell asleep while stretching after
At home
at home or at the gym?
(This was like 2 days ago)
One time I was taking a break to exercise and I fell asleep on the yoga mat
i feel asleep on the floor again. i think i have a problem.
(terrible joke feel free to murder me)
once ya attend UCG, the only math you'll be doing is getting people's numbers
it's ok. it'll all work out.
damn
um
(I'm just being dramatic)
it's brutal and abusive and I want out
what kind of math are you guys learning?
uhm

^
You're already a better adult than most
also bc this math hw is stupid and contrived
terrible
how's it feel to technically be an adult
also if y'all wouldn't mind, pls don't let parents and shit get wind of this bc parents talk and i've already gotten my ass kicked for saying certain things
so
thanks
lmao
<@!503787499605458954> i'd rather not. i already have gene #2 for that.
happy birthday!!
beat me to it
fuck you gene
also, happy birthday
i mean, it's an option if you need it
tbh leaving the house is just fanning the flames
yeah, if you're in a pickle, i'd be more than happy to try to help out if you needed somewhere else to stay for a bit
yea you can come stay for a bit if you need to get away
tbh if you want my parents would probably be chill w you staying at my place for a while
if you think you want/need to, that's completely valid
debatable
salina do you need to get out of the house for a bit?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68c2M4r9oQg
if you wanna talk about it, go for it
so why do you think mcmansions are stupid
the last part is quite entertaining actually
to say the least
sounds like a hot mess
that
yikes, i'm sorry
i can now tell you why i think mcmansions are stupid and houses can look like screaming birds wearing hats
on the other hand
so life is fun
mom's her own self-victimizing basket case
dad's doing his best
there's really not much to say or do or just anything
oof
yay
at this point i might as well live on r/raisedbynarcissists
^cindy just said what i was trying to say way better than i ever could
we love you and if you wanna talk more we're here, if not that's aight too, I just hope you're doing semi ok
but that doesn't excuse any of the other shit
I don't think anyone ever knows what they're doing in life but adults are supposed to get better at faking it lmao
sorry I went to do something else but salina I'm so sorry you gotta put up w this bullshit
hopefully they dont?
well
things either burn or they don't
at this point it's trial by fire
there's nothing to do
no
should we be doing something?
ok, that's not the right way to ask that
well
are things ok?
but like yeah
i'm joking
lmao
damn
i'm so sorry
yikesicle on a bicycle
unless someone's family is willing to straight up adopt me lol
and i'm afraid y'all are too
i'm stuck watching the fireworks
😦
nothing to do here
no
it's cool if you just wanna vent or talk about it tho.
is there anything i could do to help?
idk fam
ya tru
it's like holy shit why have you not grown up
*kinda* doesnt' cover it
people can just kinda be dumb
but i'm still sorry you have to put up with that
that's good to hear
true, that's valid
but i'm just waiting on other decisions to trickle in
i already have an opportunity lined up
meh
i hope you get that opportunity then
im sorry
and i really wanna go out of state for school
i'm sorry
life is dumb
but like yeah
i'm being vague
lol
i guess?
head desk
just more stupid
no, not really crazy
that's crazy
damn what
i'm just here to judge the supreme amount of bullshit stupid
and it's not even directed at me
more stupid bullshit
but noooooo
i thought it'd be over after saturday
oof
my weekend was dominated by that kind of stupid
im sorry
yeah
sigh
like a frying pan to the face
really get ya
almost always
like the supreme levels of stupid just
yea
that adults have no fucking idea what they're doing
do you ever get the feeling
wanna talk about anything?
oof im sorry
are you ok?
speaking of which, my life has been going up in flames and everything is *peachy*
not bc of the relationship
i'm a smoking trash can fire bc of other factors
oh, sasha and katya are p functional. i forgot about that one
jane and cole are honestly great
jane and cole and p functional
tyler and rachna seem like nice people
then there's these two seniors from my freshman year
and salina and noah would've been my fourth, but i was like "well, her nickname is literally smoking trashcan fire, so idk"
but i could be totally wrong
tbh i feel like there's more like... normal relationships in the normal level kids
who's in your count lol
yeah i can tell now
i meant romantic
lmao
nah, plenty of solid friends
wow
i was like
oh
lmao
i thought you meant friend relationships
oh
`i've been stuck here for 4 years, and i can count on my hands the number of relationships i could point to and be like "that's not a dumpster fire"` is decidedly untrue
how many can you guys count?
well, ok
ergo
your claim does not hold up to scientific testing
i think this speaks more volumes about how few relationships i know about rather than how few arent trash
yike
don't be nice
yeah, romantic
i could make it 4 if i'm being nice
wait romantic relationships or
include the obamas
granted, i don't know all the relationships in skyline over the past 3 years
oh well
laughs in this whole group
wow
damn
or maybe i'm not
im massively overlooking something lol
shit, i'm at like 3 right now what
lmao
count
i've been stuck here for 4 years, and i can count on my hands the number of relationships i could point to and be like "that's not a dumpster fire"
i guess we already all go there huh
that's skyline
maybe just gu
what if the g stands for "cute garbage university"
sign me up for one of these
go get whatever you need
sugar daddy university
and sdu
damn lol
cgu is a grad school tho
rich daddy university
and so does rdu
cute guy university
cgu exists
but
(aside from the united church of god as i showed earlier)
UCG does not exist
also, guys
STOP
<@!520095106888630348> dashing beginning
hahaha jane
but i just wrote a math problem answer as 4sis(pi)
maybe noah survived because he got a _running start_
also very random
i don't know her
what's that
hahahahahaha danger
i mean, i don't trust ib students to know how to run away from danger
it's a damn shame :p
unfortunately
maybe noah's gonna survive this one
SHIT
finally i will live in a world without noah
he's a faster sprinter than me
actually maybe not
take solace in that
noah will die before u
it's okay
imma die in 2 minutes
<@!271149039020408843> or, ya know, you could just say hi to me like a normal person instead of repeating things i already know
also if survival depends on running from predators
same
hahaha
lol
You. You should not have survived
we have beaten evolution with our massive brains
there's so many people who should not be alive
Sometimes i see people and I'm like
we've kinda fucked the whole natural selection thing
laughs in can't swim
true
<@!520095106888630348> *taps forehead* can't die of swimming in polluted waters if you don't know how to swim
The problem with the gene pool is that there is no lifeguard
well i'm sorry i don't hit your levels of risque lol
oh that's tame
i'm sorry sorry sorrrrrry
but it still can make you wet
much like the dating pool
shit
something something fish fucking
the sea is also polluted with lots of trash
<@!340319804747415553> D E W  I T
my degeneracy has limits
nope!
do it
sorry jeesoo
a bad joke to be made there
there is
Theres just so many fish in the sea
do you speak from experience?
you'll get ass I promise
jfc jane
don't go to school in the middle of nowhere and get on tinder
guys
uhm
tbh just
lolll
university of cute guys?
is there a UCG?
i blame noah
i'm sorry my humor has just gone downhill
i think so lol
prob emi
was it emi
find yourself a daddy on campus
wasn't someone tracking what schools had cute guys
lmao
some people do
so if dream schools and crushes are equivalents, shouldn't we just be basing our college lists by which students we find attractive to kill two birds with one stone?
my dream school can give me 4 years of stability and top tier education to prepare me for a long-term successful future. what can your dick do for me
lmfao
assian excellence
both would be good but I get what you mean
true
this human better appreciate my ass
school/personal achievement >>>>>> boys
but also the letter
its a matter of whats realistic and what is now
<@!271149039020408843> get that natem
i do want both
meeeee
i want all the shirts
i change my mind i want this one
<@!271149039020408843> why not both?
I know we collectively use him as a punching bag but be nice for now
and the internet really does have everything
damn
if you can get a custom "FUCK NOAH" shirt, you can get anything
tbh ill be more excited to get accepted by my dream college than some boy
the internet has everything
fair enough
the internet
lmao jane
yeah fr where'd they get it lmao
yikeroo indeed
can i get one
yikes
*on a shirt
C I N D Y  W H Y
i had a friend who had that on an shit
oh g o d
call me a slytherin bc I really wanna slither in
also rip
IM SO SORRY
OOF
hahahahaha
S A L I N A  N O
and thats the tea
LOL
sorry
this guy is hardly a dream school
i'm
dream schools are crushes in college form
you can say that you really wanna get in
LMAO gene
i guess it wasnt a good one
are crushes just dream schools in human form?
it was a double entendre
im talking both
porque no los dos
lmaooooo I meant the guy but it applies to both
damn
i ask completely unironically
both
<@!503787499605458954> are you talking about college decisions or the guy, cuz i literally can't tell
i dont feel as terrible
i appreciate the support
thank you guys
yeah good luck Jeesoo
you're great and i'm sure he can see that
who knows it might not be what you expect
best of luck
but we all hope it goes well for you jeesoo <3
we just joke about it
im sorry
lol it's all good
F
sad
esp since a certain idiot went silent on me lol
regardless of whether you come crying or laughing, we'll still be here for you
i'm always down to talk
and life will go on either way
ill either come crying or ill come laughing
thanks
well, we're here for ya
want all my acceptances/rejections by April 1st :))
alright
yeah ill know by the end of march
but DAMN sadboi hours are real
our problems are way too universal wtf
Is that bad advice
"Just see how it goes"?
im sure im just sat bc its the nighttime
😦
just don't let it keep you from having new experiences
^
well then don't throw it out the window
i dont have the power to be a bad bitch and just say forget about the past lets get some college ass
jk love you jane
wonder who
*cough*
i think it's doable for some people
the future is full of shit
and it's a tricky situation
i've honestly been turning over the same dilemma in my head
yeah, that's understandable
regardless of how it goes
but ill miss them haha
if this goes wrong then i dont have to deal with long term consequences
you have backbone
im half glad and half sad its senior year
true
closure is nice
at least then you'll know
shoot your shot
it happens
when the results probably will be less than stellar
but im just unhappy right now because of all the effort ive put into thinking
i respect that
respect
alright
damn
regarding when ill tell them very matter-of-factly, clearly, and in person
ive set a deadline for myself
and it's okay that it matters to you
you're stressed over what you're stressed over
it doesn't have to make sense
^
but it matters to you and that's what matters
i think we've all been on emotional lockdown over "stupid" shit before
it's okay to be bothered by it
but idk why im bothered so much and its hitting really hard
like i know i shouldnt be stressing THIS much over
what's the bigger issue? Men?
oof?
thats the bigger issue
i mean im straight but
i thought you'd specified gender already but wow i'm an idiot
yikes sorry sorry
yeah thank you
he can stay anonymous, i respect that
don't worry, i won't try to sniff him out
ah
i'm sorrrry
:/
dont expose things like that i was being ambiguous on purpose
^
i don't know who this person is but i'll be as involved or uninvolved as you want
i'm coming in with the crazy expose
(i meant the hitting on other people thing, not advice. i'm here to support you)
lol sorrrrrry
wow rip
but no one does in that class tbh
😦
im just
yeah i know
I dont know him at all
i'm joking
I'm mostly joking
we'll respect that
and if you don't want us involved
i'm not good at that kind of thing. don't ask me unless you want me to fuck shit up for y'all.
its another reason ive been super hesitant to bring too many people into the details of the situation
i dont want to pressure this kid
i would be so down
I'm excellent at hitting on people for other people
prepare for hitting on people at parties in college
guys we should be wingwomen/men for Jeesoo
brb
get me a cap
am a dunce
no it's true and you should say it
can confirm: some people are very oblivious
i don't mean it
i just did it for the pun sorry
:p
sORRY
you can really be a blockhead sometimes
exhibit a
some people are just oblivious
agreed
lmao
..........this is me
ok but
they're walking around with a block of wood on their shoulders
loool
lmao
i think its a matter of brain density
i make it as obvious to this person as i can that im attracted and they dont catch on but others definitely do
some people know
a couple of classes
school
if my hunch is correct
or person
cackles in wtf are emotions
true. where do you see this guy?
indeed
amen
humans are hard to understand
it's ok to feel exhausted
that's ok
im exhausted yall lmao
you're just trying to process how you feel and your situation. it's what any sane human being would do.
it's not empty or pathetic at all
hey it totally makes sense and is okay that you feel that way
"the opposite of love isn't hate, it's indifference"
i can see where you're coming from
im just sad and frustrated like ive said 80 times in this chat
and i feel like sometimes apathy is a lot more hurtful that straight up hate
mhm
to know you're constantly thinking about something and how to remedy a situation but you know that the other person hasn't thought about it twice
empty and pathetic
it's a rough situation and i'm sorry you're going thru it
and it feels like
that is honestly way too relatable
and its senior year and ive got other priorities and responsibilites but im thinking about this a lot
i just feel stupid because ive been trying hard and making a fool of myself and everyone around me has noticed but not the person that matters
say what's comfortable for you
don't feel bad
that's our priority as well
what matters in this situation is how you feel
that's fine
that's ok
i just feel bad because im not being very clear
okay then
talking helps
do you want to keep talking about it or would you like us to just shut up about it
that's ok too
aw rip jeesoo
oh, oops
i have no clue what i want
all i can say is that good friends appreciate openness and honesty in a friendship. they understand that that's sometimes hard, but good friends will be there to support you. the last thing they want for you is to feel uncomfortable because of feelings.
do you just want to vent?
and im not necessarily demanding advice from you guys
but the reason im frustrated is because even after all that im not getting anywhere
oh L
im not a dumbass like ive tried every method
messenger pigeon is your option after that lmao
lol
email?
again ive tried multiple times
rip
L
we are never together alone and they do not do social media
if you can
i'm sure you have your reasons
find sometime to do that
alright
no
i know you said you've thought about it
im just sad
jeesoo, have you talked to this person in explicit terms though?
no dont be sorry but like
(kind of regretting jokes before reading all of this)
i'm sorry
i'm sorry Jeesoo
and you feel like a clown and idiot because you arent getting to anything
it doesn't mean you've done anything wrong
that honestly sucks
i'm sorry
and nothing has changed
you know when youve been working at something for a long time and put a lot of thought into it
it's been a long day
it's valid to be exhausted
im just exhausted
lmao
yeah do it with *consent*
just don't do it in a sexual harrassy way
you should ask them if you can do that
i don't judge
lmao
alright well you can live by that motto too
google says "seize the ass"
what does natem mean
if it doesn't then you won't see them anyway
carpe natem 😉
if it works out great
lmao jane
and they might as well not use social media
carpe diem was made for times like these my friend
rip
oof
except it doesnt work that easy because our schedules are so grossly misaligned
that's what i was thinking
yeah
they might just not be getting the hint
^
yeah multiple times
have you thought about talking to them privately and laying it all out in explicit terms
even if you don't want to pursue anything
if your friend values your friendship as much as you do, they will appreciate openness and honesty.
huh
and others around me have noticed but not this person
because there's no visible progress or change
oof
the thing is like i have been rather open and i feel like a clown 24/7
in my own experience, just playing the long con makes you fucking miserable
idk
honestly, i think it's better to just be open with that person?
im just frustrated and its sadboi hours
yike
then what the hecko do i do
and its senior year and we arent gonna see each other again after graduation and its just a casual fridnship at the moment
if you dont mind
what's your current relationship with this person?
we're all here for youuu
so it comes down to like if theres a rpospective person im interested in and theres a hyperlow chance itll ever come close to working out
what cindy said too
or is that also off limits
what makes you comfortable is what's best for you right now
if you wanna dm someone any of us are down
and why you think that would jeopardize what already exists?
we're ok with broad terms
can we get some context as to what you want to ask for
dw bout it
theres just a lot of people here and i can talk only in broad terms
<@!271149039020408843> Fair game
^
it's okay
you're not being frustrating
yea it really depends on the situation I'd say
L
i just dont want to self-incriminate
yeah ik im being frustrating rn and i appreciate you all dealing with that
oh whoops gene beat me to the punch
but you dont  have to
elab would be nice
i think
would you feel comfortable elaborating on the situation? if not, that's ok
should i ask anyways even if it means risking things that already exist
aw :(
if i want something really bad but theres a 0.1% chance ill get it
h g u ?
u g h
mood
im just frustrated and have no clue if whatever im doing is right
aw :(
i cant stop it and its like an endless cycle
even though i know its not the way i should act
have no clue why im acting the way i do
you're not a clownnnn
hey, y'all deserve the world
but anyway oof
every day. im like why am i such a clown
mostly bc we keep hearing it from dsong
i think that was the least pretentious use of whomst i've heard in a long time
cindy
<@!258094439636008971>  almost
I'll fight them
whomst
oof
😦
<@!261949028994908170> it's almost as if we're not supposed to have an insane workload rip
mmh that's fair
human relations are difficult
or do you want us to shut up
it isnt even necessarily thw rokload either like
we're here for you
or do you want to just talk about it?
aww
insane workload -> less sleep -> mood changes and increase sickness -> miss/skip school -> more insane workload
do you wanna talk about it?
can we help in any other way
but there wasnt anything anyone could do to fix it
oof
everything was not alright
is everything alright, jeesoo?
till it sucks out your soul
im a tired, frustrated, sad, hurt bitch
life sucks and then it sucks some more
awww, i'm sorry
c
b
yeah
why is every ib kid mentally un-okay
also life is busy
aw i'm sorry
just a bunch of frustration
que paso?
aw :(
some men suck
r i p
today is just a shit day for everyone I guess
oh rip jeesoo you ok?
I'm also in that sickness purgatory where I'm not really sick but I feel like shit and have a sore throat
aw jeesoo what's up
im a fuckin sadboi yall...
yeah I napped from like 6-8:30
i died at 5 and got back up at 8
lmao
already crashed for 3 hours
get sleep if you can
as for <@!340319804747415553> , that is truly unfortunate
thanks guys 👍
what a delightful time
random but i think i'm getting sick
stay alive dude
much love
good luck
I'll get through today and see what life throws at me tomorrow
thanks guys
i hope things turn out ok. let us know if there's anything we can do to help. we're here for you, dude.
take things one at a time and split each task into smaller sections
^
same advice I gave gene yesterday, make a list and prioritize, how I do it is by time vs. impact i.e. the things worth the most points per time spent I do first
hang in there
aw david
just do only the things you absolutely have to do and get as much sleep as you can tonight
it's gonna be alright
and I came back home pretty much at 7 pm, so yeah... I'm going to stop here
maybe try taking things one thing at a time so you can work your way to getting enough rest?
yikes
yeah, hopefully
hopefully
oof
This evening it's just been a bad one in general, maybe things will calm down tomorrow
L
The thing that ticks me a little, is that:
I have to take notes on Calculus
I started multiple pieces of homework for Physics
I worked on one of DigiPen's scholarships
and I've got a socratic seminar tomorrow for Dystopian fiction.
i remember trying to umpire a lot last year, and it ran me into the ground when i loaded up on too many hours
^
but things that require you to be active are like... more of an L
bc when i worked boutique retail i had pockets of quiet time to do random shit, like i could prob do hw
also, salina's question is still valid. i pushed it up further than i intended
finding balance is still really important
make sure not to push yourself too hard
which, my point is
probably unhelpful, but relevant
what do you do for work?
so yea, i could see that being disruptive
after i quit, schedule cleared the fuck up
i used to teach tkd 3 times a week
that's enough to be annoying tho
yikes
i can easily see that racking up really fast
2 hours Mondays, 2 hours Tuesdays, and 2 hours Fridays
It might not be that much
how many hours are you trying to work?
the less sleep thing isn't going to help anything
which means less sleep, and it becomes a cycle
awww
yikes
But the homework I got today was more than a regular load, so I'll be awake farther into the night than usual
o o f
I'm trying to work more hours because I feel like my net spending is going negative
if you're comfortable sharing
anything in particular bogging you down? what kinds of thing you got on your plate?
oof
I'm starting to feel that way
I'm just afraid I'll get there
i'm here to listen if you need someone to talk to
you doing alright?
i think that's called burnout
Have you ever felt that maybe you are doing too much, but gotta keep pushing through no matter what
fair enough
All my musical accomplishments can be traced back to Pokemon
Fam, I grew up listening to only one genre of music: Pokemon music
Okay so it's not just me
I have
how many of you have heard this song???
https://youtu.be/iqvBT9fSEHw
OK I need help guys
oof
also my body can’t decide if it wants to be hot or cold
honestly not really i’ve had a pretty consistent fever for like 16 hours but i still gotta work on my chem ia bc it’s due tonight!!!
you doing ok?
o o f
not to add on to the “we’re all dying situation” but guess who has the flu
That's the plan
30 minutes ideal
Don't let it turn into long nap
1. I was being a pissy sad boi (which in hindsight was kinda dumb)
2. I'm in bed and about to take a short nap
get some sleep
you looked like death in bio today
dude speak for yourself lol
Hopefully y'all can get some regular rest soon as the year winds down. Y'all deserve it.
I'm sorry guys
Awww
I oscillate between sleeping an absurd amount and flat out not sleeping
but mood
oof
me as hell
lmaoooo
Sorry bad timing
I don't really let myself dwell on things so instead I just feel kinda empty and tired and contemplate the pointlessness of life, and it usually culminates in me giving up and going to sleep or me giving up and working on something I actually care about (read: not school) to snap out of it
idk like I've realized I'm legitimately super unemotional compared to most so me not doing great doesn't manifest itself as like crying or actively being sad
rip
mmmhm
honestly I might have said this before but I really suck at being honest about my own issues
I'm ok right now
laziest outfit, puffy dark circles, raspy voice, slightly gross hair
Awww, you doing alright?
to be fair, I genuinely looked like shit today
Flemer reads minds
L
"you look like shit"
lmao she was just like "are u ok"
You doing okay?
What happened?
Oooooof
well, I got to skip physics I guess
tfw asking your counselor for additional stuff for canadian schools turns into a 40 min conversation about mental health and me being on the verge of collapse
minutes spent talking are minutes that could be spent working
sleep consistently
this isn't a time for technicalities
look gene, just get the work done
I've been sleeping
get sleep
once again, ignore wt1, take things one at a time, it should not take long
i'm sorry to be blunt
now get off discord and get to work
okay good
I know it is
but it's the best route at this point
i'm sorry it sucks
just face it head on rn
that's the only solution at this point
just get the work done and go to sleep
In extreme general discomfort
I'm just
don't stress about any one specific thing
I'm not particularly stressed
I believe in you
you can do it
if you specifically want emotional support we're here for you but otherwise the best way to beat stress is to just get shit done
I do
have a water bottle/glass of water by you at all times while working
well drink more
good
I've been drinking water all day
dehydration is one of the most dominant causes of headache and fatigue
drink lots of water
you're gonna get thru this
talking to us doesn't get work done
you got this
just focus on work
^^
and also just turn off discord
Also, the last time I yeeted an Advil down my throat, I just had a worse headache for the rest of the day
don't even think about it till tomorrow + you already have one from last year to fall back on if this one ain't as good
and don't waste too much time on wt1 to begin with, since you're already stressed
do french before wt1
That's nice
Oh is it?
If I'm prioritizing:
-Stats cuz holy shit I'm behind and I need to get caught up
-History cuz group project
-WT1 cuz a big lot of points
-French cuz I think I have a C-
[A lot of space]
-bio
bio onepager is due tues
take an ibuprofen
and i can send you some notes on the circ system that i have from SAT
bio is fast btw
That sounds like playing with fire
i would say do history presentation
get the other stuff done
yes bitch
W h a t
it's due 8pm
^ i agree with that
Yeah, I have an idea, but my head is hurt hurt
ignore wt1 do it tomorrow
wt1 is fast if you have an idea and don't give a shit about writing style
I'm like glued to the floor right now
what's gonna get you the most points for the least time?
ok from that list prioritize
rip i guess
Just making a bad joke
Ik
wt1 = written task 1
bio is fast
Wtf indeed
wt1
Written Task 1 (or is it 2?)
French busywork that I have to do lest my grade keeps tanking
Half a stats assignment I should probably just finish
Some work on a history presentation, but it'll only take half an hour if I'm functioning
Maybe having some bio notes done would be nice
oof
I thought I would be past this by now
what do you still have to do?
My homework isn't doing itself
I haven't even been awake for 11 hour and I'm already tired
My head feels like a brick, and it hurts to think
take care of yourself
well, we're here for ya
aw :(
Not entirely
what's up dude
L
u ok?
I'm an incoherent mess right now
I want to hug them
rip the gator man
Depends on the number of sting rays and how pissy they are
but then if you're rescued before you die you'll get charged by the state
it's super fun tho
surfing is really not that dangerous
in a semi-dangerous area
or go surfing
yeah lol
easiest way to drown, probably
look for a riptide
live it up before you die
take a trip to hawaii
Forget how to swim
But then
Go swimming
I'll just like
Good point
in that case there are much more straightforward ways to achieve that
That's the plan
unless you want to drown
you better be certain it's not going to flood
What if I went in lived in a valley below sea level
they thought mountains were divine simply because it's close to the sky
remember classical is the one few people can practically do because it requires uprooting your whole life and moving to the mountains
classical vs folk daoism though
in china it's sometimes difficult to separate buddhism from daoism
there's plenty of religions in the mountains and good lord it all turns to mush
I don't want to be the super happy go lucky woman in the mountains
actually
well there's plenty of buddhist monasteries in the mountains
she daoist
remember the video of the super happy go lucky woman in the mountains
no it's not
p sure it's buddhism that's out in the mountains
lol
Geneism
idr
or maybe it is
Then maybe
Oh
that's not daoism
wait
No
do you want to be a daoist, gene?
that's basically what a daoist does
Ceased to exist
Or like
Dropped out of high school and went to live in the mountains as a hermit
Guys, what it I just like
You do? Impressive
✋
Does anyone remember the last time they went to bed at a normal hour the Sunday before a school day?
Oof, I hope you start feeling better soon
Get better soon DDD:

Damn rip

i'm sorry guys
taking care of yourself is important!
mood
i just can’t
i have so much to do but i’m heading straight to bed
but i end up spending too much time on one thing
or i intend to half ass everything so i have time to touch on everything
at this point i am halfassing everything
hopefully it won't happen again
oof im sorry, david
everything of this FOA screams pretentious bs
So I started doing homework around 9:30
Worked from 3:45-6:00 and then went to pick up mom from the airport
im thinking about pulling quotes from the rules and looking at how objectives and mechanics of each board game reflects their point in history
I'm fine, although I did have no time today to do pretty much anything
are you guys ok?
rip
why the actual fuck did i think this was smart
i'm literally analyzing things that don't use words for their language
my FOA is murdering and im feeling burnt out
I'm going to be awake way farther than I should
wanna talk?
oof!
far from it lol
are y'all ok
I'm joining you in sad boi hours today
I feel so close yet so far
when you get picked up, can you try to sleep in the car on your way back?
get dropped off
yeah i think she’s in the orchestra next door
did you drive yourself or get dropped off?
oh hey!
i saw audrey qiu here
im sorry
i just wanna Sleep i’m still in bellevue
then focus on that and not TOK. one of these matters more than the other
it speaks Volumes that i’m carrying out my chem IA all the way through when my classmates are making up data : ‘)
the best prep you can do for yourself is sleeping
_have you met me_
w h y  a r e  y o u  p r e p p i n g
if you and your partner did the outline, you're fine. the rest of it is kinda just finessing. maners specifically stated it was a space for practicing
yes
were you here today for TOK?
only the outline is graded tho
but i have a partner i can’t just leave her in the dust
it's really chill tho??
but i’m presenting tomorrow??
maybe don't work on the tok presentation tonight?
must study for math...tok presentation...Chem IA
please try to get some rest
also hugs and words of encouragement if you can't accept sleeping
well that sucks
sleeping is your award
😦
sleeping
yes, actually
is there an award for playing a 20min piece straight through on no sleep
hahahaha emi
_now let me mansplain it to you_
the whole thing is like hey i got this epiphany about paradigms!
Stay strong
thomas kuhn
Me too, fam
tired of his bullshit
can the little fucker not use normal comprehensible vocabulary
why the FUCK kuhn talk that way
^
just let me know
alright well we're here if you need anything
oh i see
already did
do you want to rant?
thanks though jane ❤
my real problem is that I'm only done w like 40% of what I gotta do tonight
I'm just pissed off but I'll be ok
can i help?
are you guys ok?
good times
another night of everyone dying
much love
Also, Emi is right
I mean, I don't blame you. I would feel exactly the same.
for real though breathing helps refocus your concentration
thanks guys idk every time this happens it just puts me in a "middle fingers up idfc" mood but like I KNOW this is no bueno and I Actually Need to Do Shit tonight
I'm so sorry about that. You've been really busy recently. You do not deserve that in any way whatsoever.
Holy shit what the fuck
sorry bout that
well that's fun
nothing like being called useless to make me more productive am i right
lol as y'all know I was already like really fucking unmotivated but then she decided to visit and yell at me for a) sleeping in today b) not finishing stuff c) being up "late" (this is not late) and then bitched a bunch for not doing the dishes she left in the sink earlier today
^
bc either option is perfectly valid
do you wanna talk about it or do you need some space
Is everything ok?
aw i'm sorry
my mom
what happened
oof
^
I'm gonna scream
yeah, not okay
but rn
i'll be okay in a bit
Idk
i just need a few days to recharge
yea, me too
I guess none of know how to find motivation
is TOK pres a physical turn in or tii
Damn
So you too huh
so we gucci there
and i figured out what i was doing wrong in normal proofs
i just need to skim the proofs stuff
and i should study for math but part of me is like.... ehhhh
i still have bio
i barely finished kuhn
My lack of motivation is kinda making me hate myself, and that's probably a sign something's wrong
mood
And back/shoulder/neck pain
90% of me is just dread and wishing to not exist
But like
Like, I can probably finish my bio IA in an hour or even half, and then I could finesse Kuhn and finish it in class tomorrow
I feel like I'm close to being done but also kinda screwed
What do you guys do when you're lacking energy and you really need motivation
i want to just insert a few days between now and monday
I wanna sleep
fuck everything
still true though
cuz of how much of a cycle this has become
i knew you were going to type that before you finished sending that tbh
same
i kinda wanna cease to exist right now
and she probably did too
I honestly forgot until just now
lol then no
Also she didn’t upload prompts from what I can tell
There’s nothing on her website about makeups?
Idkkk
is that due tomorrow
fuck
Are you gonna make up the comparative essay for Matheny
Also Cindy
giggity
it's like
so not ready for buddhism soc sem
i am
L
saame
FOAs in English
I haven't paid attention in like at least a week
in any of my classes
what is happening
So idk
Then again, Anthony seems about as done as I am
Unless it was someone I don't have to worry about pissing off cuz they know I'll do the work
sigh
that sounds like we probably will go through all
I didn't want one
but
I don't have one, yeet
I don't wanna piss off my partner
5?
how many chapters are there per group
'cause I feel like maners would just do a big "fuck you"
but that's like the only thing stopping me
ok mood
I wanna skip the rest of the year
and skip tues
but i will go tomorrow
do you think we'll actually get through all the tok presentations
i want to skip tomorrow and tuesday
I REALLY wanna skip tomorrow
That sounds like my bio IA lol
he wants to sound smart so he throws in a bunch of words that are hard to understand and makes him sound smart
But I'm not forcing the world to read it
kuhn is just pretentious
But a bad one
My bio IA us a long-winded text too
i don't really consider kuhn to be one
jk i just talked about onions
Heheh
whoops
laughs in bio ia
gah i hate long winded science texts
especially for science
prefer concision
90% of the time though
^
for as much shit as I gave it and as often as I skipped the homework, I actually enjoyed tindall & shi
True
it depends
i'd rather it be short
That might just be me though
I will gladly sit down and read something that takes twice as long if it's engaging even if it only has the same amount of info
it was dense but like in a good way
yeah it was a lot of info
But you have a point
He was dense af tho
Sophomore history book dude
i thought keylor was to the point
I liked keylor
who is keylor again
damn
i like keylor too!
I can ramble for 10 mins
ok
lmao
Kuhn makes Keylor sound interesting
of bullshit
10 minutes
or send the outline i have
for the presentation
i can tl;dr it for you
what are the actual requirements
Fucking shit
tbh probably 90 minutes
Shit
hm... i did it over 2 days in segments so not sure
How long did 9 take you?
this chapter in particular or all of it
rip
It's supposedly the big L tho
Haven't read yet
<@!258094439636008971> lmaoooooo
I have 9 too
mine is "nature and necessity of scientific revs"
The way he wrote it made it sound like he didn't intend for anyone to read it
I didn't understand the first 2 either but we're past that so idc
rip nevermind
9
what chapter did you have
also to be fair i'm sure his intention was not for it to be read by high school students
"it has limits and the way we investigate shit restricts our learning"
"it exists"
which part?
Hell, even if it's not succinct, do us all a favor and make it enjoyable
"science"
it's like
^
because i don't get it
i agree
please ELI5 it to me
if you understood most of it
"succinct"
"to the point"
Bearable
More like
Ok, not coherent
idk i understood most of it
^
True, but you can at least make your writing coherent
but in the words of drag race "if you have to say it's art, it's not"
i think it's hard to be very intellectual without sounding pretentious
This book is a shining example of why I typically dread reading nonfiction tbh
i would argue intellectual pretentious is stupider
I respect it, but it hurt to read. There was definitely talent though.
instead of intellectual pretentious
I def got annoyed @ her
but it was artsy pretentious
but
she actually had talent
eh that's fair
woolf was also super pretentious
also *collab
i'm hurt
i actually liked woolf!
He and Woolf should do a collab
mood
facts
He reads like a dead guy
because i would like to send him a real nice go fuck yourself
which is a shame
also he's dead
fuck you kuhn
while i appreciate the term paradigm shift
I haven't started, so rip me I guess
i was doing a partner chapter but because of deca did not work with them so i did it alone
also
ah yeah that thing took me a good while
Oof
it also doesn't fix the TOK reading
but it doesn't fix life as it is
good news is nice
I mean, idk, but I just figured you could use some good news
Well
even if i get into schools
i think that might just stress me out more
honestly
L
Hopefully we can all take a collective sigh of relief once decisions roll in
so we'll see how this goes
scores might've been tallied wrong
because logistics were fucked and uh
but that might not actually be the case
riperoni
we didn't qualify for state as a team tho
disease detectives
yo congrats!
anatomy and physiology
medaled in two events
scioly was okay for me tho
Although Salina def sounds way busier than me
I haven't played Smash since you guys came over that one time
it's just a rush to the next thing
oof!
because there just has not been time
i haven't played overwatch for 3 weeks
I'm sorry love 😦
Not whatever that stress boi we just had was
Like a legitimate break
I mean, you even sound like you need a break
Damn
and my math grade is doing a big sad
jfc school and competitions and home and ahhh
Oof I'm so sorry
and it's like
plus i had so much stuff this week
like i was working thru the snow days and break
the last 3 weeks have actually been hell
need a break
i just
same
Hell, I really just need to make it to Wednesday
Honestly, if I can get through this week, I think I'm in the clear until exams
4 hours
lol no worries I'll be up for another like
brb
whoops
i need to send my business ia over don't i
anyway cindy
okay
L
i don't have shit laid out as far as i know but i might
ahh ok good to know
but i had everything laid out already
i took 45 minutes
depends on how much research you have
helen: UH
while not *quite* my least favorite book (yet; if I was forced to read all of it it might get there) this is definitely the most pretentious thing I've ever read
but i don't need a 10 page chapter of garbled bullshit dancing around a point
<@!340319804747415553> do you think i can do Criterion D in the WR IA in an hour
i understand the argument of something like this requires nuance
like yes
it all feels like stalling
agreed cindy
yup
Oof
and my will to read this has died faster than noah driving on a familiar road
This is bullshit, and he's wasting way more time and words than he needs to
honestly
I don't think he understands the nature of scientific revolution either
<@520095106888630348> can testify
me neither
It took me 30 seconds and 3 circles to model chapter 2
don't understand the nature of scientific revolution
i like
Ok, this book is so bullshit, Maners told us to model it in a diagram on Friday, and believe me
quality
it's time for the businessman bullshit
so
is that both me and my partner are in deca
the good news
i don't know how i'm going to fill 10 minutes with this bullshit
why is this book popular
but in the VAGUEST AND MOST INCOMPREHENSIBLE TERMS POSSIBLE
truthfully
mood
I haven't read my chapter yet, but I feel like I'm not going to have to, cuz he just keeps reiterating himself
and just say it straight
can you like take a chill pill
if there's restrictions to "normal science"
like dude
idk if I've ever had the displeasure of reading an author with his head this far up his ass before
Never trust anyone named Thomas
or whatever his first name is can't be bothered to check
god FUCK thomas kuhn
More eloquent than the book
That wasn’t eloquent at all but okayyy
L
Took the words right out of the mouth but said it more eloquently
No, I totally get what you mean
Sorry, rant over
It’s a book for the people who think they do the big think
I don’t understand how this got popular?
Keyword is effectively
And this is a big ass but
But
Sure it has a “point”
Effectively communicate a point
The author fails to do what writing is meant to do
It’s such a self indulgent book
I was sick of it ages ago
There’s formal writing and then there’s I like hearing myself talk fancy
Like dude
And I’m so sorry but I’m getting so sick of the author’s pretentious bullshit
I’m in a two partner one
L
3
What chapter?
Oof I'm sorry
fuck this chapter
I can’t get thru the TOK
Kinda bad
how do you people do
boink
yoink
anything got anything interesting to say? cuz i'm feeling kinda fatigued from doing my bio IA and want to distract myself
you'll be fine lol
Hopefully I'll be ok lmao
I turned in my physics IA to turnitin on time but never gave her a hard copy before yeeting myself to deca
Also
I really need to just grind it out tonight tho
My bio IA is late, and I'm doing it tonight
this is a final deadline and it's on turnitin...
And I told sherm that and he was like lol yeah just do it after state
lol
Lol I straight up ignored the econ IA that was due last week
and then math test on tuesday
Oof
just found out i have WR soc sem tomorrow and i can't prepare since i have to do WR IA as well
Much love hmu if you wanna talk
Get some REST girl
!!! Go dad
Take that break. You've more than earned it.
Awww, I hope you feel better soon
But like yeah I need to take a break ngl
Less consequences long term and also dodge that test real good
I’m prob skipping Tuesday tbh
nice
damn
Did not expect that response
Me: my mental health sucks rn and wow I hate school
Dad: so when do you want me to call school to say that you’re not going
no worries. i hope things get better soon. let us know if there's anything we can do to help.
thanks
yeah that's right
am i interpreting that correctly? i don't mean to leap to incorrect conclusions.
i understand that it's difficult because he's kinda disconnected from your life, but as long as you're being supportive of your parents, you're doing well
i think that's valid. you're allowed to feel whatever you want to feel in this situation.
its just kind of a weird situation
i don't know if i should be sad? like im mildly sad i guess
its just kinda like
are you mainly concerned that you know that it's hard for him/your mom but you don't really know what to do? because that's completely valid, and you shouldn't fault yourself for it. sometimes, there just really isn't anything that can be done other than supporting those around you
i'm really sorry to hear though.
unless you think actually communicating with him would help
i would mainly try to do your best to be supportive of your mom
but i don't really know him
it seems that my grandpa on my mom's side is like At The End Of The Road
is everything alright?
like how do you Act
idk what you're supposed to do when someone you distantly know is dying
that's rough
but sorry that happened to ya, helen
twas an L for my savings
my parents made me pay for all my trips this year
oh
ooooof
huh
Yo, shit, what?? That's dumb
My mom just made me pay $100 for my Deca trip without saying I had to pay for it before I went
Lollll
Shit, they ordered broccoli while I was asleep on their own? They grow up so fast...
<@258094439636008971>  be proud
Specifically
We ordered broccoli
We will be fine 😊
Yeah lol don't worry about us
Have fun, but don't push yourself beyond your limits
Well
I love the idea of shopping but dear lord it tires me out mentally and physically
I'm a Bellevue square right now
Ok, sure, but take care of yourself
Going to live it while I can
possibly my last
I'm at D E C A
S l e e p
For fun
W h y
Probably going to be up for another 10 hours from now
Omg get some rest and eat a vegetable
My skin is glowing for someone who slept four hours and ate junk last night
It's only been March for 40 minutes, and I like just now felt some allergy symptoms kick in
Did break make anyone else forget what it was like to be sleep deprived?
I guess it's ok to indulge myself every now and then for a week straight
Um
My fist maybe not yours
Like the size of a small fist
I don't know how much that is but rip
if you eat more than a cup every day then yeah
a week is basically the same thing, right?
oop
i’d say a month
Ideally
How long should it last me
like last you or last in the fridge?
how
like
uh
How long does/should a gallon of ice cream last?
otherwise, drink some water or tea
if it's not too important or immediate, maybe sleep
<@!460689096646590465> how much do you have left to do?
start being productive when all you wanna do is nap
how do you uh
Don't worry
It's going to be okay
Haha I'm glad?
I haven't seen it, but I believe in you
unrelated but jane saying we can fix it was the most relieving thing i’ve ever heard in my life
I guess
I don't know her that well, but I don't think she'd want to work with me or Anthony
And all the solo spots were gone
Eh, maybe she probably decided you were probably the most responsible out of the remaining people
I don't have anything against her just thought it was odd
IDK why she asked me
Yeah I didn't want to work with Noa
I don't honestly think Anthony likes me all that much lol
Yes
Shit, I need to talk to Anthony. When's this due again? Friday?
I might be wrong
6?
For the tok jigsaw
Do you remember what chapter I was supposed to read
Yeah?
Hey gene
It's alright
I'm sorry
Although I guess in some ways, it's one last time since this is the end of IA season
I just wanna not have to for once
With some effort I'm sure you can
Listen you can get through this
Aw I'm sorry
Although I suppose it's feasible
I've been going back and forth between crying in a ball in the corner and just being a dead boi for the past hour and a half or so tho
But you can
Turn off your internet if you really have to
Yeah
Can I though?
You can do it
Alright
vB is probably willing to explain. I imagine she's counting on it if anything
But that might take longer to explain to him
You could also possibly come ask Gillespie before school
I'm sure she'll understand
Reschedule your meeting
Alright then
Hm
She usually shows up right when class starts. Idk if it's enough time to explain my problem.
Hm. Ask her before class?
Shit, I gotta put in some AP stats this weekend too before they threaten me with probation again
For the Viva Voce, I know it won't take long, but I'm scared that if I go through tomorrow, vB might leave before I can talk to her?
Rough and final draft
2 sessions of 1-3 hours
French is a couple hours
Uh
Haha no don't sweat it
oh ook
David Kim sorry
Me?
Viva voche will take like 10 minutes don't sweat it. FOA shouldn't be too long, do you have a topic? David and I can also figure out a topic if you're too busy
Is French going to be time consuming?
You can do this
No
I don't exactly believe in myself, so this is why I'm asking lol
Is it too much tho
Ok your bio ia is not that bad. Don't worry. We can fix it. Turning things in late is okay
i’m turning in my IA almost an hour late haha i’m gonna kms
but you know you can do it
a lot
that’s
I hope I can get my bio IA done tomorrow afternoon, but I don't trust myself to not be dumb
Does that sound feasible or too ambitious? I don't know where I should be taking Ls in here.
I'm thinking:
Today: cry for a little more, read through the rest of the reader, read that 4 pages of history hw, and clean up my bio IA so I'm not a complete embarrassment when I go beg for help
Tomorrow: reschedule Viva Voce to next week (I should probably just send an email tonight), do any TOK stuff in French (work period), hope the saint that is vB saves my ass, make the fix at night, finesse my French external assessment rough draft, and cancel my plans to go see the PLMS band concert
Friday: continue getting bio help if needed and sleep. Maybe start FOA
Saturday: FOA or bio grind. Pick your flavor. Start planning out TOK presentation ideas.
Sunday: FOA or French grind. Pick your flavor. Grind The Reader journals.
Monday: French grind, maybe present FOA
Tuesday: present FOA if haven't already, turn in French assignment a day early cuz I won't be there the next day, go home and cry
Wednesday: band trip, sleep is for the week cuz fuck Mercer Island's band program for making us arrive at like 7, come back to school, cry
Thursday and beyond: FOA presentation into full gear (idk Maners's timeline for this, but I can start this earlier if need be), Viva Voce hopefully done by this point, get shanked by colleges, cry
Possibly
Can also assist
L
Anyways
I had an edgier answer, but then I remember the dipshit squad made a most emo category and put me down for it, so maybe I should just not help there case there
I would give it a hug
the void screams back
what if
I'm mostly just thinking out loud. You can just pretend to listen. I just don't wanna seem like I'm screaming into the void
okie
Cease to exist
So I just need to plan out like the next approximately one week of my life so I don't like actually
Hi thanks
estoy aqui
hi
All I got is IB Physics, so...
Does someone who has somewhat similar classes to me have a moment (preferably in IB bio in one form another)? I need to think some things through but not get stuck in my head again
if you combust, you'll be the hottest out of all of us
well
aw :(
Awww I'm sorry
thanks i’m going to combust
i hope things get better for ya emi
rip?
anyway
i'm in two paper events for deca
wha
why the fuck i wrote two papers
i don’t want to talk about it
Awww, I'm sorry
i question
in the same boat
so yeah we’re all doing pretty damn terrible
Do you wanna talk about it?
i’m going to throw my phone into my laptop screen just so i can break something and feel the satisfaction of doing Something to release the rage i harbor quietly inside
Everything ok?
i’m on the brink of tears
Or maybe just me and Noah. Idk.
We all doing the unhealthy here
No, but I have hoped for one that would hospitalize me until just after senior year ended or beyond so I could get pity to graduate and just let it all stop, but I'm not a fan of long-term health consequences enough to go and actively wish for that
current mood
wow it’s really sad boi hours out here
you know that feeling when you hope to get in a car crash tomorrow on the way to school, but not a bad one, just enough to get pity from your teachers and have your deadlines extended
also, sorry you had to read through that.
ill try to get through this asap lmao
Yeah ofc
thank you so much
but i'll just attribute that to it not being fully ripe yet
and the red one for some odd reason
it's in the green one cuz it's not ripe yet
If chlorophyll isn't in your peppers then it's not useful to your investigation
Yeah
oohhh, i suppose i could compare the stuff that showed up to the carotenoids only and not worry about the chlorophyll since it's just not there anymore?
but how do i do that if some of the peppers only had 2 or 3 bands?
that's what i'm thinking
Because if it's your control then you should be comparing the peppers to the spinach
cuz i actually know what the pigments are cuz vB told us in class
Why is spinach your control?
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hoc7wNcymbqGcBxNwVhManRQVTe_QHygQcYAXeFbsZc/edit?usp=sharing
well
it's not readable at the moment. you sure?
but some colors had more bands than  others
Wait ok <@258094439636008971> send me your ia I'll look at it
i'm comparing chromatography of different colored bell peppers
You need some way to say which hypoth is right
What are you comparing?
yeah, you have to prove either alt or null hypothesis
Yeah
<@258094439636008971> do you need a significance test??
<@!193229269076279298> what do you mean
it's really fucking wack cuz each category has a different number of measurements, and they're not numerically aligned, so i either have to figure out what all the pigments are (can't find any info online) or just kinda compare everything against everything, which doesnt feel procedurally correct
idk
or maybe it should be an ANOVA test cuz categorical data
i isolated a bunch of pigments, but i don't have a reliable way to tell, so my current plan is to just gonna run t-tests on them and compare them to my control group, which i think i fucked up the measurements for anyways, but it's something
i dont know what significance test to use for my data cuz my data is super wack
it depends on how long it takes me to figure something out
so how fucked are you guys right now
Thank you for asking. I'm in a bit of a better place now.
Yeah, I just woke up a bit late. I'm just staying home to finish my bio IA.
You good?
oh my gosh that was a mistake
but i get what u mean
it's not *that* late
None of us should be awake rn
im not thinking clearly. im getting distracted. im stuck pondering a choice. if i sleep, i won't have a choice (aside from skipping, which is kinda valid i guess). im sleeping and setting a shit ton of alarms
yeah, idk. i felt like i got 2 hours of sleep last night despite getting 6.
but you're clearly not productive rn soooo idk
i would stay up and marathon it if it were me
mmh
can someone either validate or shut down my idea
im not looking forward to the reading
agreed
less is more
im thinking i should just sleep now, wake up at 5, and do my work then
like holy fuck
because the boi is a pretentious bitch
why is it so d u m b
i just got thru tok reading
mood
rip
i kinda wanna collapse, but im really feeling dead on the inside
im not sure what to do
where i have work but im just looking at memes late at night again
also, im doing that thing again
no problem
thank you love you
you deserve it. just be sure to take care of yourself and not overeat.
cereal
what are you eating?
who wants to validate my late night stress induced eating habits tonight by saying "emily you're allowed to eat bc you deserve it"
it's a big oof
omg i saw that thread
thats a lowercase L
l
I realized that the SL business IA structure is p different from the HL one today
Me too
It’s okay
i’m currently brain dead
only 3 of my brain cells are functional at any given hour
My brain ded
its truly sad boi hours
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
printer smell good
ravioli are dumplings
<@!520095106888630348> S T O P
i'll get the calamari and the onion rings
<@!258094439636008971> dumplings are ravioli
lmao
That sounds like a waitress telling you to order appetizers
what do you mean?
do you want me to get you started on something
I would say things, but I don't really have a lot of things to say lol
Thank you
Yes
Is it valid to have sad boi hours when nothing in particular is getting to you but you're just feeling sad cuz you're an irrational moody boi?
screech
good question
No, we're not
Aww, I'm sorry
are we elderly
i just stretched and my entire spine popped in different spots
I tried to take a half-hour nap, and now I'm stuck living with the reality that I accidentally took a two-hour nap
awww
i took a nap and now the pain of being alive isn't dulled by the feeling of nonexistence
Although I wouldn't complain about a week off.
Honestly, every time I've seen Duke on the news/in memes these past couple years, it was one of the highlights of my day. He's so precious. This was kinda saddening to hear.
this is tragic i think we should all take another week off school out of respect
Guys, I have very sad news
I only know her because we were in the same second grade
Where even is she now
So I guess it must be right
The first looks more familiar
Is it katy Ellis or Katie ellis
Is Emily Tang a real person, or did we just make her up in our heads
no i had a moment after typing that where i was like is katy ellis a person or did i make her up in my head
"katy's not a real name. that's one of those things where someone just spelled their child's name really poorly. wait a fucking second. wait, no, that is how you spell it. what the fuck."
i stared at that message and was like
how long
you would not believe
i have No Clue why katy ellis was in my dream
Jk
Katy Ellis = gang
and then a bunch of tall and buff men came out of the limo and shot me and i woke up as i tried to dial 911
Lmao
and then after i threw a tantrum i ran away and ended up at this parking lot and then i saw katy ellis scooter by like she was running away from smth and this limo showed up and somehow my brain processed it like "shit it's a gang"
i mean, houston's supposedly p nice
i had this really weird dream last night where my parents were like "we're moving to texas" and I had this whole public break down about it bc i didn't want to move to texas because i thought i would die as a person of color
thank
ye i'll be at your place in 10min
cough a few times into a bottle of water and deliver it to me or something
just like
give me some of that too
hey, could you like
my throat hurts oops guess im sick can't go to school oh no tragic aw man that really sucks
tragic indeed
well thats tragic
my brother is 30 years old, and he still firmly believe ib diploma was the hardest thing he's ever done in his life
idk man adulthood sounds stressful
hopefully by then, we just wont be as stressed
GROWING UP IS SO SAD I CANT STRESS EAT WHEN IM OLDER
lmao

h
^us trying to submit our IA due at the end of the period
my brain cells
fattest mood
wait hold on
that episode is basically ib diploma
college
also
well, it was for the sake of contrast
when ib diploma gets too overwhelming
i Don't know what you're seeing
that picture is adorable
first of all
but in reality we have us a this:
how i thought my senior photo looked:
self explanatory
girls walking into school with their starbucks on wednesday mornings (im one of those girls)
my senior photo
why are there so many moods to be found here
when maners makes you do reflections at the end of class
my math ia
we need to all get together sometime and watch spongebob
lmao
yes?
jane coming out of the womb
I've had senioritis since kindergarten
IDK what you're on about
me at graduation
F
me coming into freshman year walking into period 1 for the first time
it's too real for me to wear to school
i do sometimes at home
why haven't you worn it
please do
hang on, lemme send you a picture of it
you know exactly what im talking about
my sister-in-law got me this shirt for christmas
holy shit
dude
i came to high school looking like the shiny round spongebob and im coming out looking like those grossly detailed spongebobs
we were never freshmen
first semester
more like freshman year
not even
sophomore year maybe?
when was that
remember when things were sort of normal?
god life just Knows when to hit us
So
After being calm for like 6 months I suddenly sprouted like 5 giant and painful pimples
i hate Everything
DUDE SAME
also i am so sad because my skin decided to break out and it was looking so good for such a long time
Sounds about right
me: wow so much time and no school! I could use this time to catch up on work and even get ahead! 
me: doesn't actually do shit
Hope yall are doing semi ok
Also my sleep schedule is well and truly fucked and tomorrow's gonna be miserable on all accounts
But it never ends
I keep telling myself like just a few more weeks
Mood
it was almost as if i actively thought about doing it earlier because i knew it was a good idea at the time but then didnt because im fucking incompetent at having self-discipline
ayheyhey
I've just ignored it the whole time and now I wanna die
It's been a week plus like six snow days and for the most part I've had a great time but in the back of my head there's this like looming reminder that wow! I actually have shit to do
dont be
im sorry for making you feel sorry
is there anything i could do?
its okay
oof im sorry
thanks for asking
pushing through
not too well
so how are you holding up?
and somewhere to cry
i want to cease to exist
ay
i was just thinking the same thing actually
you know when you have to be productive but you're too sad or stressed to be productive but the root of the negativity is the thing you need to get done
If you wanna talk we're all here
Huge same on school fuck everything
Aw emi
please let us know if there's anything we can do to help. we want to be there to support you.
thanks
cuz you deserve them to be
well, they should be a happy few months
theres only a few months left in the year
its okay
uh
oh
i've been trying not to go
i think i saw her once last year
well i haven't gone back to her since sophomore year
hopefully it's been helping a bit
awww, that's good to hear
she's really nice
i've been
yeah her name's summer
i don't mind feeling bad for you as long as it means you have someone to feel bad with you.
and a therapist is p valid. i know there's a few options (skyline even has a thing where they can like lowkey source you out to a swedish hospital(?) therapist without letting your parents know, and i think it might be free)
hopefully tomorrow is a chill day for your sake
i should invest in a therapist
yeah i mean i don't really Like making people feel bad for me
just because it's not my fault doesn't mean i can't feel bad for you
its okay its not your fault
awww i'm so sorry
or have to think in depth about anything
or work on my chem ia
or take notes
or turn in anything
i don't wanna go to school tomorrow
its fine
i'm sorry you have to deal with this right now though
things will get better
fam, i'm just here telling you the truth is all
thank you the real mvp
and soon too
just know things are going to get better
no, it's alright. i might not have direct advice, but i'm here to support you.
you don't have to have advice on hand lol i know its hard helping people with emotional problems when you yourself are not in the emotional place to
its cool
i'm so sorry
D:
top 3 things on my mind 1) every time my aunt and uncle come over i have a whole religious identity crisis 2) i don't know what i want in a college anymore i hate school 3) my bio ia can go to hell
<@!460689096646590465>
wanna talk about it?
everything alright?
_eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee_
not to be dramatic but
We're here for you if you need someone to listen or support you.
<@460689096646590465> Is everything alright?
i might just unload a ton of emotional baggage here later tonight
That's one way to describe it
My life is just so interesting
What can I say
It's the roommates hypothetical again lol
I saw this without the context and i was like what the FUCK sort of sitcom is jane living in
Oh my god
F
That's some inception shit I can't tell you anything about
wait, i can wake up from my life then?
Nightmares are dreams too
you might see it in your nightmares
however
that's physically impossible
Does seeing it in his dreams count as seeing it
i would hope not
It will stay that way, I'm not inviting you to watch
although you did video call us that one time without having pants on
<@!193229269076279298> you're right, i haven't. let's keep it that way.
that was not as bad as i was expecting
So how can you judge it
but <@258094439636008971> you've never seen me have sex
don't you fucking say it
i just thought of this
don't fucking say it, noah
no one should be subjected to dreams of noah having sex
i would hope not
None of you were in the orgy though
with how often we joke about orgies in this server, it was only a matter of time until it popped up in someone's dreams
Cole and my brother? They were going at it
A lot of people were
Who was going at it
So were they going at it or just chilling next to each other
well then
i don’t know why i’m laughing so hard
cole and my brother were _in bed together_ and then my parents invited a bunch of people over and the people invited started stripping and having an orgy in my bedroom and my sister walked in so i went downstairs and was talking in spanish with Fran and then my parents yelled at me for speaking a language they couldn't understand but the room filled with glittery smoke so i had to leave
and then Cole and I went on a triple date with some people from the orgy and one of the couples left because they hated me and we went to visit the other couple's parents only to find out that the girl did not love the guy so he tied her up with some vines
and then i went to class where i had to present about how to make an inflatable raft with a sheet of plastic and nickels with Mrs. Bennett grading me. And my 5th grade teacher also gave a presentation that was, according to Mrs. Bennett, "too long" and she skipped it
Now we know Jane really wants
Thank God
yes
Please tell me that these two things were separate scenes
I mean, the second half of that sounds like what physics was
which included an orgy in my bedroom and Mrs. Bennett judging my ability to make an inflatable raft with plastic and nickels
tell
a very weird dream
i had
hahaha
brb, sending to cw
....not too far off no
<@!520095106888630348> is this what you meant earlier by us all being in this together?
portables 9 and 10
1st and 3rd monday of every month
oh
not what
oh I said when
the explanation i give to people who i can't say that to is "it's an exploration of french culture open to all students, even if they don't know french"
well then
im the president, and i have no fucking clue
when even is french club
we made crepes that one time but noooooooooooooooo
that's why i would go
i mean
it's an extra snack day
or, as russell roberts calls it, "free food club"
ew
***J O I N  F R E N C H  C L U B***
*clears throat*
_sign me up_
7 sl and 2 hl
sl and hl combined
it's literally 9 people
IB French is only a few people?
it's a different form of misery
when there's a lot of people, you're not as comfortable around everyone, and it's just kinda isolating
i mean, you feel like you're all in it together when it's a small squad
Wait what
even french isnt stressful cuz it's just 9 of us telling each other that it's bs. if there were 60 of us, we'd be dying. i think it's just a social factor.
14 person class, sign me the fuck up
omg  y e s
I LOVE THE SMALL CLADS
and pop quizzes are less threatening
i feel like the smaller class size is a large part of it rather than the content
History is less stressful than last year that's for sure
Okay fair enough
Sounds legit
honestly, i dont mind history that much. gregory doesnt give us that much homework (barring that one project), and it's one less IA. i think i would legitimately be broken right now if i had another IA to worry about.
i get that different people have different views regarding it tho, and i definitely understand the other line of thought
french 3 is yike
sl is standard Ls
hl is higher Ls
french 1 and french 2 are the move
French doesn't seem like the place to be
Yike
look miserable as all fuck
the hl french students in our class
let me tell you
as someone in an ib language still
I should've done hl Spanish
I hate history
Ugh
i'm just citing some *evidence*
but i'd be more than happy to listen to your *perspective* on the issue
Stoooop
skyline has a *history* of doing well on it
again
well
Ib history might be an L
We'll see
Oooof
never forgot ib math sl exam 2018
if we could survive the math exam from last year, everything else will be a cakewalk
you're gonna do fine
o o f
also, i can hear the teacher saying something super generic like, "would you care to explain what's so funny about geometry?"
I'll end up making a mess. It'll be symbolic of what I'll do on the ib exam
but i approve
that's not what i had in mind
w h a t  t h e  f u c k
No you're right
https://youtu.be/cRYMOIn45uE
that's probably just me being totally off the mark again actually
is it like where you just take the water bottle and just chug it but like you also squeeze it so it comes out really fast?
but no?
but also yes?
no?
You know what I'm talking about?
Is it like that super fast drinking of a water bottle
one lorge sip
let it all go down at once
c h u g
No one else can have apple juice
Just for me
lmao
request whoever is doing snack day again for apple juice again to be safe or something
As long as I'm better by snack day
It's okay
ah, i'm sorry
It's ok
Worst thing is I might have to bring mashed potatoes for lunch a few days
alright, but be sure to take care of yourself. that comes before any one day of school in second semester of senior year.
It'll be fine
I don't know
i'm sorry. that sounds really rough.
I don't know
oh damn
Still not on normal food
Stitches come out on Tuesday
do you need to take a day?
Still in pain
Not sure how I'm going to get through school on Monday
btw, forgot to ask, but how are you feeling?
oof i'm sorry
I am on too many drugs
Damn
lmao
SOMETHING
... watch someone?
I don't know if that'll work for you
Myself? Read a book or watch someone usually
what do?
Perpetual mood
i only mention it to partially get my mind off of things lol
you ever get that feeling when you really wanna get your mind off of something and think about other things but you know you probably shouldnt?
thank you
Everyone is in a bit of a funk atm
You're not alone Gene
that came out wrong
Oh
ok, that
the fact that we're all suffering together
Snow?
nvm
What?
thank you. knowing that actually helps a lot. almost forgot about that.
Going back to school will be... difficult after 3 weeks of sporadic snow. But we'll get through it together ok?
we were kinda promised ib would just be over and that like 2nd semester would be it, and our lives could proceed as normal, but it doesnt feel like it's slowed down on us.
i guess we're all kinda in the same place at the moment.
thank you. i hope so.
Don't worry
Things will look up
I get that though
Aw I'm sorry Gene
idk if that makes any sense
ehhh, i'm not really feeling like i'm in the greatest of places at the moment
it's a little silly now that i say it out loud but like
i just have a lot of things i need to do and no motivation to it, and my life overall is just kinda at a weird point where it doesn't really feel like it's moving anywhere.
Do you want to talk about it?
not really 100% at the moment if ima be honest
<@258094439636008971> are you doing ok?
are we though?
i guess we’re lovable and capable
Have we actually lived like this for four years?? How??
But holy shit
And maybe a hug.
I want to cease to exist.
My homework is just rotting over here. I can already feel the sleep deprivation on Monday.
it’s the lack of socialization
I've slowly gone from "let's accomplish all my dreams in a week" to "maybe I can get some homework done" to "I despise existing" over break
Same tbh
it’s been like that for a few days smh
Anyone else feel really dead inside right now?
I'm kidding.
I don't feel any pressure to be in a relationship whatsoever. I'm not going to enter one unless I feel the opportunity properly presents itself, and it's a situation where I feel comfortable in. It's very unlikely I jump into a relationship unless the relationship is something I truly want.
^
Gene if you want my advice
Ignore social pressure to get in a relationship. Do it when you want to and then hopefully you won't regret it so much
That came out wrong. I support y'alls' relationships. Relationships are good.
Eh, if I ever get  T H A T  desperate, I'm sure I'll find a relationship in college or beyond that makes me regret ever wanting to be in one, so it'll work out in the end
eh
That's a p high bar to clear tho
school stresses me out more than being in a relationship tbh
rip
I've never been in one, but relationships just sound stressful 9 times out of 10
Idk how I feel about it either. I just kinda am.
which is understandable tbh
you just seem simultanously a bit down about it and proud to be single
no, no you're fine
damn
Shit, do I act that desperate?
I don't talk about it that often
Wait, really?
and on the topic of relationship (being single) you and Em are talked about the most
Salina, me and Jane talk a lot though
Katya and Sasha barely talk
ok fair point
Damn indeed
damn
Thus creating the illusiom that a vast majority of us are single
Alternatively, maybe it's cuz I make up half the messages in here, and I'm single
when in reality 38% of us are in relationships
I mean more it feels like most of the group is single
eh
You have a logical understanding that each relationship is made up of two people, but you're subconsciously viewing the relationships as units on their own
It's a matter of perspective
?
She is, but you're demonstrating you're not viewing it as such
Katya is a unique person from Sasha and vice versa
but that's not how it works
But it feels like four people instead of eight people BECAUSE YOU'RE VIEWING TWO PEOPLE AS THE SAME UNIT
If we were to include the hypothetical relationship, that's still only 4 relationships
rip
You see, each relationship holds 2 people
You've simply fallen for the trick of relationships
No, it's not that
and Katya and Sasha have tact
but then Cole isn't around
it feels like mostly single people
it doesn't feel like that much of the group is in a relationship
so some reason that really surprises me
d a m n
No worries. I don't blame you for not keeping track of previous messages, especially considering you already can't keep track of when you agreed to hang out with your friends.
Oh yea
>50% if you count me and Gene #2
What do you mean lol
oh are we counting them?
i'm just giving gene shit
8/16
emi and cindy
katya and sasha
jane and cole
me and you
no
37.5%
6/16
F
i vote fail at math
Unless I'm failing to math
If Cindy and Emi actually start dating, that would mean 50% of the server would be in a relationship
#NerfTheFlerf

pls nerf

I'm like Kirby in Smash but with the inhaling ability buffed to be instant and cover the entire horizontal length of the stage
How long will it take you to escape my range
*long enough*
Depends
_for how long_
for how long
So you just starve for a while
but most importantly, the 4 inches you wish you didn't have on your waist
Just be around me for a few days, and I'll eat all the food before you get a chance

drugs: solution for losing everything
Wrong
think of it as an investment
L
the key to losing weight fast? drugs
it was part of a drag queen skit
^btw that is one of my fave lines of all time
inb4 "the coke keeps me thin and the booze gives me a personality"
That's not concerning at all
the wine gives me personality
D:
Does she tho?
uh
she lovesss us
yes
does <@!460689096646590465> really want to be around us when she's sober though
just be sober and able to give consent
you hear that emi?
Cya
byeeeeeee
K bye
Gene #2 stole my phone there for a sec
I'm down
Oh it's this meme again
Sorry about that guys
Ahabhssjdnanjsnsabbs dn
Holy fuck
Why have I been tagged like 10 billion times
I'm simply happy for Gene #2
do you accept <@!460689096646590465>
so <@!503787499605458954> it's all up to you
you must be thrilled gene
lmao
This is great
Wow, Gene #2 and I are a model relationship now
<@!460689096646590465> do you think you could do that with <@!503787499605458954>
sounds like things are going great
Ikr?
And we really feel for each other when things aren't great
And we're also just so happy for each other's successes
sounds glorious
wow how nice
We're both busy people, but our limited free time somehow always seems to line up
We share a lot of common interests
It's just a very natural fit
such long-term commitment
how do you make it work
i envy you guys
damn
Step up y'alls' games
Weak
Gene #2 and I have been dating for  y e a r s
hmph
well we were by the time the party actually rolled around
we weren't together when he roped me into being his gf
hey hey hey
hahaha
pull a <@!193229269076279298> and get an airbnb for me and my “girlfriend”
<@!503787499605458954>  go get some lol
this is a mess <@!503787499605458954> just go out with me
*cough*
shut up
*wink* not Cindy
*it was Cindy*
it's not gonna be Cindy
Well
if you say it’s gonna be cindy then i’ll know
Then what's the problem
but still
okay true
I don't think it means you can't have met them before
well blind means you don't know who it is
it’s not blind if i Know her
Rip
Wait, does it have to be a guy?
Cuz we could just drag <@503787499605458954> into this and call it a day
got any ideas <@!271149039020408843>
yea
<@460689096646590465> did
Did someone say blind date
Bethany and I spent a solid half an hour bitching about you lol
I told you to go to sleep at 2
NOAH WHY WERE U UP THAT LATE
Wait wtf
I mean, not at the right time to pick up my phone calls
then passed out again
hey I did wake up part way through
I don't know how one sleeps 13.5 hours, but those were the wrong 13.5 hours
Didn't wake up until 7:30
The boi went to bed at 6AM last night
Can we all encourage <@193229269076279298> to go to sleep soon?
Now that it's almost ten
Also, guys
Can I make Common App my sugar daddy considering how expensive app fees are?
Lmao
do it
At that point, you just buy common app
maybe you’ll be the global sugar daddy
who knows what’ll happen in the future
you never know
I mean, I know I can. They have nothing against me. My identity ain't worth shit.
can we really trust common app
Common app has my social security number, so that's probably the more concerning one
Yeah, ik lol
i’m sure it’s Fine
L
Also, I'm moderately concerned cuz NYU Tisch technically has a picture of me on file forever even if they rejecc me lol
USC is like the cheese on a mousetrap for me.
Great programs for game development and game design
One of the best marching bands out there
Big school with a pretty campus
But then it wants to snap me up with tuition, fears of heartbreak, and whatnot
It's a reminder that the system as a whole sucks, yet we all have that school that makes us keep blindly walking into the trap
Ah the sweet embrace of death
But that's not a  h u g e  deal
"if I make a wrong turn at night, I might die"
My biggest gripe with USC aside from tuition (which is something for all of them, so that doesn't count) is like
L
I have major gripes with all the other schools I've applied to tho, so idk
there will be better schools who will treat you like the king you are
Rip
gene it’s an emotionally abusive relationship
IT'LL WORK OUT THIS TIME I SWEAR
cycle repeat
that one ex boyfriend you still have beef with but get back with once in a while before breaking up all over again
I'm just aware of the stereotypes
I mean, I'd jump all over an acceptance lmao
Shit
Bc that’s exactly it
why do i feel like USC is like that one ex boyfriend that you still have beef with for gene
USC has dramatically transferred from rich kid party school to actually good academics with some oddballs kinda there to party in like 30 years, so everyone assumes that I'm trying to go there to party, but I'm just like "I'm way too socially awkward for that lol"
Lmao rip
Something something probably USC in a nutshell
y ik e
O o f
“The beer gives me a personality”
Apparently NYU has really strong stereotypes about each of the schools
at least they’ll have a personality
Lol
can’t go wrong dating someone from tisch
Still tho, if anyone here ends up at NYU, date someone from Tisch for the memes
Rip
Yeah Princeton
Princeton?
OOF
You can smell it in the air
Oof
Yeah people drink... a lot
If you have to date someone from NYU, date someone from Tisch, cuz your appearance is part of your app
She was like
My Princeton interviewer was a hoot
Dude
Lmao
it’s definitely not a party school
ALSO
And if you're going to NYU and are going that far out of your way to be in a frat, idk what to say
Most of the people there won't be in frats
Not into frats
NYU is very uh
i’ve been stalking NYU fraternities
Shit, is it?
sadly NYU is closer to the bottom
i’ve been ranking them by cute guys
Like someone out there needs to make a list someday
Can we rank colleges by how good they are for dating?
Rip
ain’t a problem for me but they’re not usually my type that’s all
<@340319804747415553> sums it up p well
Rich kids flexing with daddy’s money
Sammamish just has a lot of dipshits in general
There's also just nothing in the area
Big facts
I KNOW TOO MANY PEOPLE HERE
But probably true
O O F
Lol
no tinder is only good if you move away from sammamish
Hahaha
okay i vaguely remember this now
Oof
Like "WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING ON TINDER"
what was i talking about
You mentioned it, and Willson was just kinda horrified
no i don’t remember please
Last year
what
i
really
-_-
Also, I remember that one time Ms. Willson overheard you mention using Tinder <@460689096646590465>
This is both true and false
Can I go catfish guys on tinder
okay Noah is but that’s it
Yo Noah
I feel insulted
Rip
I am emotionally considerate
Good riddance if this is true
Good
good riddance
i think they broke up
Yeah rip friend's friend
R I P
yeah i guess so
Huh
he didn’t know me so i swiped right and we matched so
Was he like actively using it?
anyway good men don’t exist
Damn
O shit
i ran into this guy who was dating one of my friend’s friend on tinder
mostly bc there is So Little to swipe right on
Lol
i have not
Have you ever actually followed through w a tinder date
no no
Guys are a myth
Guys just don't exist in general
tinder had nothing left to offer
Lmao emi
T H E Y  D O N T  E X I S T
once i ran out of boys on tinder
🎧 where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away 🎤
Specifically Skyline
tragic
Rip
ah that’s high school isn’t it
Yeah same lol
Most of the single guys I know are dipshits (unless you wanna count some juniors)
I'm not really friends w anyone who fits that criteria
I don’t know anyone
Jk I’d be really bad at it
Emi do you want me to set you up :p
Rip
he just happened to respond
i didn’t ask noah specifically
Noah is the last person you ask to set up a blind date
Also, Noah's definition of "emotionally considerate" is very different from ours, so the bar is probably scary low
I mean, considering what the majority of his single male friends is like, I'm kinda concerned
Lmao
I'm concerned that Noah is actually taking the blind date thing seriously now
now I want to know
nvm
<@!460689096646590465> what info?
Lmao
I think I *am* one
Rip
I am... almost a 6 ft tall dipshit
Oof I'm sorry
I'm so bitter
wait what’s your current info <@!193229269076279298>
From the floor
Tall person hop
And can just grab it
And then this 6 ft dipshit comes along
I TRIED LIKE 6 TIMES
And then I'd be too tired/weak to finish it
I was trying to do a route earlier but to start it I basically had to run jump grab the first hold and then do a pull up
Different giraffes for different folks
Depends on angle of elevation
Again, at what point is someone considered a giraffe?
Sorry?
Rip?
TALL PEOPLE ARE SO UNFAIR
Btw this is only tangentially related but I just had a resurgence of rage
Though fine I forgot the giraffe thing
Oh, I thought it was solely an appearance thing
He's not soft enough
He might be pretty but he is not a flower boy
Lmao
Noah is a pretty flower boi
He's a sugar daddy
And he's not a giraffe
Lmao rip
1/4
How
<@193229269076279298> To be fair, you hit 3/4 of those requirements
Salina has questionable judgment ability when it comes to dating
At what point is someone considered a giraffe?
my current information says otherwise
wait she does?
I gotchu girl
salina knows what i look for in a man
^^
*probably not a giraffe
*sugar daddy would be nice
*emotionally considerate
*pretty flower boy
what are you looking for in someone
first we need a list
alright <@!460689096646590465>
Also *blind
But that’s me lol
I’d be hyped :p
Damn
Imagine someone sets up a bling date for you, and you get there all hyped, but it's just Noah sitting there
Lol
Lmao I'm sorry lol
That’s my job :p
You don’t get to pimp him damnit
YOU ARE NOT HOING OUT NOAH
i think i know him tho lol doesn’t he have a girlfriend
GENE
actually rich sugar daddy is good too
I hear he gets people laptops
His name's Noah
So I know this guy
Hm
Damn
does anyone ANYONE want to set me up on a blind date i’m only half kidding
<@460689096646590465> I mean, we trust humanity to fuck shit up if that counts
Lol all good
sorry about your things cindy 😦
can’t trust humanity with anything
Loool
so i thought you meant you walk with your phone in your shoe
And my credit card n more important shit I hide in the case
also, i didnt realize what you meant at first
I take my phone w me
thanks for the info
but I've started putting my valuables in my shoes actually (wallet, phone, etc)
It's my dad's microsoft one tho so it shouldn't be too hard to replace
we always do that when we go there
im sorry
oh, so you rely on people's good nature as well
oof
My fault for being too lazy to grab an actual locker
L
So
And asked the front desk
I even went back and looked after leaving
Idk, I've never had an issue w people going through my shit before but it was in my coat pocket when I got to sbp and it was gone when I left
You drop it?
wait how did your card get stolen?
did you cancel the card yet?
i hope your nail heals soon tho
ooof i'm sorry
Lol I'm in PAIN bc I basically tore a nail off and someone stole my orca card but I had fun so it was good
how've y'all been?
I'm glad
and that's a W
Anyways I don't deal w anything well either so
Well, worst-case scenario, I suppose it's been a good day overall
Though I guess napping counts
/keep myself occupied w less-than-productive things
I kinda just force myself to not think about it
Ooooof
Like I was having a p good day up until 4, but I knew I had nothing but homework to do for the rest of the day, so I just took a large sad boi nap
Y'all ever have like a really good start to your day, but then like you know the rest of it is gonna be like shit cuz of what you have planned out
aww thank you cindy
sending virtual hugs
aw jeesoo!! I just saw this. and hey, definitely relate lol. just wanna say that you're awesome, brilliant, and a ton of fun, and we're all here to love + support you if you ever need. literally what this channel is meant for. sorry I missed it earlier and I'm sorry that all that happened to you but I 100% believe in you as a person, it's okay that you don't really know what you're doing w your life, big huge same on feelings @ going back to school, and I highly highly doubt you're not gonna be extremely successful in the future
any time
thanks
what's most important is that you know that it's there so you know you're never out of options
at the end of the day, it's just another option if you feel like you still want some additional help
another thing is that im a busy human much like all of you and really dont need another schedule thing added on to my to do list or to have to drive places or hold appointments etc
but then again im not the professional
i feel like i do a fair amount of introspection and wonder what the therapist will have to add to anything
cuz training
and they're just also like good at giving advice too
it's kinda like having someone to talk to without having to deal with fears of it maybe affecting your day-to-day interactions
from what i've heard, it's basically like having someone to talk to and sort through your thoughts.
and i wonder if itll do me any help or good
i also dont really know what seeing a therapist is like
i haven't gone through it myself, but i know that's there, and i can send you the info if you want that option available.
of course, it's ultimately your decision, and you should do what feels best for you, because you're ultimately the most important person in this situation
skyline has a thing set up where they can source you to a swedish hospital(?) therapist for free without making a huge scene over it or alerting your parents
i know of some ways to get help without involving your parents
also, if your parents are the concern
but i appreciate the offer
just because it's "not *that* bad" doesn't mean it doesnt deserve attention
and this isnt something im willing to communicate to my parents about
it isnt so crippling that it impairs my daily life
not really
^
have you considered seeing a therapist?
getting it out of my mouth has helped organize my thoughts
i just talked a lot at people
ive tried a lot to remedy it
i dont really know myself
is there anything else we could do to help? it's really terrible to hear that you're feeling like this when you're still recovering, and we wanna do anything we can do to help
well, we appreciate you
i appreciate that
we're always here if you need someone to listen
don't thank me. i'm just stating what i truly believe you deserve.
aww thank you gene
i know whatever we say or do can't change the past or how it may haunt you, but i want you to know that the people here love and support you. no matter what happens, even if you are feeling alone, remember that there are now people by your side. while we can't change the past, if there's ever anything at all we could do at any time, please let us know, and we'll do our best to be there for you, because you're a wonderful friend to us, and someone like you deserves to have similar friends by their side.
thank you for listening nonetheless though
all i can do now is work to remedy that
it happened and it affects me
no like it isnt anything to be sorry about i
i'm so sorry, jeesoo 😦
thank you for coming to my ted talk
and i get the depresso
when i sit down and think to myself about things i suddenly dont seem so different from that 7th grade girl crying on the public bathroom floor surrounded in a pile of her soiled clothes
and even though im in a completely differetn place now then i was back then
but the littlest things that are normal and shouldnt be obsessed over make me cry and get ver very upeset
i literally dont know what im saying
but i just cant...like theres so much anxiety and uncertainty
and try to fix it actively
which is obsessive and ridiculous and a clear issue i am 100% aware
like solitude
even being away from the group in that sort of physical sense often makes me cry because it gets me thinkin about
and everyones talking in the living room and i get up to go to the bathroom or get food or smth
so lets say like it isnt even peoples fault
the most mundane and trivial things can make me really sad and give me a traumatic replay of the stuff that happened like 4 years ago
i have an extremely hard time trusting people and taking their word for things
but i still cant shake off all the things that happened that affected me back then like
and glow up happened etc
but in 9th grade i got my shit together and suddenly ppl liked me and stuff
it was just rough
i, as a math path and science path 1 peasant,,,,,
and also felt super distanced from my friends and stuff who were in advanced classes
and also i was a literal dumb ass in middle school i had straight Cs
aw D:
so thats 1 thing
i told my parents everythin 8th grade and they immediately yeeted outta there but the insecurity and the sadboi still stayed
and there was lots of depression anxious scare harmy things going on
physical
not even just emotional manipulation like full on fucking
anyways it was some hardcore messed up shit
like what sort of bitch ass move
and i just about had it when we were at church camp and they literally took my clothes from my cabin and threw them on the bathroom floor and the proceeded to call my first (real) crush over to witness me running in my underwear to get my stuff
so it was like 3 years straight of this absolute bullshit
like...theyd take my pens and stuff and throw them in the garbage and tell me i looked terrible and laugh at me when i tried to talk to them
it started with little things like ignoring me when i was trying to speak to them or pushing me aside off the sidewalk when we were walking in a group and then got progressively worse
but i think they wanted some sort of scapegoat bc the bullying was incessant man
which is fine
we were all in the same grade level and were grouped together 24/7 and i was the odd one out bc i didnt wear shorts and makeup and all that jazz and apparently that was enough to make me an outsider
a bunch of cliquey girls you know the classic trope
and it was a really harsh lesson to learn
the simple days
ya know
either people gave me food or they didnt and i just talked to ppl
back then i didnt know shit. like i was 100% oblivious to the entire world and its social workings
no one deserves to be treated like shit
i used to go to this church and it was the hell of my life (hehe thats pretty ironic)
aww D:
the severity when i think about it now was really unacceptable and horrible but back then it seemed like i derserved it somehow
i had a really hard time making relationships with people because of some incessant bullying that happened in my middle school years
alright, well, we're here to listen then. go for it
to get things out somehow
talking
and you dont necessarily need to comfort me or like fix things etc im just
i'm sorry...
i just suffered a lot from shitty people who were big bullies when i was younger than i am now
there are deep rooted things
your problems are valid regardless of who else suffers the same thing
although i try not to make it apparent
i end up crying a lot in social situations like parties or get togethers or lunches/brunches etc
cuz you still deserve to be happy
well, alright, but don't let that get in the way of addressing the problem
im aware its commone but alas im a common simpleton and suffer from those things
yea i just want to acknowledge im not being like "im the onLY onE111!!!!!! and nNO one else underSTandS mE"
im sorry 😦
i get you, jeesoo
but like i just have trouble talking to people and trusting them and just being around them  a lot ya know like all that social anxiety jazz
but that doesn't make you any lesser
there's prob carbon copies of ppl like me or you or whoever the fuck we want to think of
like
just because you might be the specialest person in the world doesn't invalidate your capabilities
just cuz it's not unique to you doesn't mean it isn't an invalid feeling
i'm gonna be real for a sec
look
im not special
damn
not saying anyone else doesnt
but i flounder a lot when it comes to human relationships
this is not a topic i talk about a lot usually i think
like i jsut
like the only word i could use to describe it all is "pathetic"
jeesoo, for what it's worth, i think you're a great person, so i have to disagree
false?
im just a not fantastic person
and i realize how much introspection ive missed
yeah okay thinking does shit to people
i wish shit was easier
whether it's hard or not doesn't invalidate your feelings right now
its just that ive had a lot to think about while being in bed sick
damn i envy you
i felt the exact same way
it isnt that my life is particularly hard right now this moment
i know how you feel with the college stuff
like you know
aw jeesoo i'm sorry
because of crippling things
😦
im going through shit
but anyways
my oral cavity is useless
fuck what now?
fuck that
fuck that
first of all im still. a chipmunk
yea
wanna talk about it?
so you're welcome here whenever
i have chronic shit
<@!271149039020408843>
fuck
like yall
mood
well
bc 10:40PM can still be sadboi hours
I'm bad at noticing change I suppose
in terms of radio music 2009 had the best bops
2009 feels like an entirely different era
ok ngl I have no idea what you're talkin bout
we'll miss you too if that helps
:’)
it'll be like a new home
you'll do great in college tho
in college, we could organize times to get together when we're back for breaks so you have something to look forward to
aww i'm sorry
im in canada but for no reason i’m home sick how am i gonna deal with college
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UcZzlPGnKdU
oh Gabe wanted to add more, neural networks and image recognition
Gene editing and smartphones had some precedent prior to 2009, but touché
and <@!258094439636008971> acquiring his 3rd braincell
oh yea
electric and self driving cars, space exploration, 3d printing, streaming video, robotics (Bostan Dynamics), gene editing, smart phones
I guess I'm thinking more in terms of technology now that I think about it again
That's kinda the big one tbh
We went from Obama to trump
Uh well
Weird thought:
When we think of 2029, we feel like the world's gonna be dramatically different place from right now, but right now doesn't feel all that different from 2009. Like, there's a few major things, but not as many as you'd expect.
You don't have too apologize. Again, most important thing is there you're now well and doing better. I would recommend more caution in the future, but remember we're always here to support you. Please take care, and don't push the not getting hangovers thing, because vomitting is big concern.
sorry for being a mess i appreciate the concern and advice that you guys gave
h e y i’m alive and peachy and i don’t get hangovers for some reason
I'm gonna pin this for visabilty in the morning:
Emi, you are a wonderful human being and friend who we couldn't be more grateful to have in our lives. We want to help support you through this. Please be sure to take care of yourself, and try not to drink too much in the future. We all love you and don't wanna see you get hurt. If you ever need us, feel free to contact any of us (several of us have already offered calls and hang outs in the other channel). We're all here for you, so know that whatever happens, there is a healthy outlet and things will get better. We believe in you.

only drink ethanol alcohol folks
oh i forgot that it made formadehyde from other forms of alcohol
i was thinking anti diuretic
yeah
https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/13
i need to shut up
whoops
dehydrogenase
oh wait
not enzyme?
wait adh is hormone
so like
it's not great that she's drunk to the point that she's poisoned herself and has to like eject it
but like if it's not a common occurrence and she's being responsible while she does it
aldh is breakdown
adh is for water level in kidneys iirc
i just don't remember much else lmfao
okay i knew that part
ok you have ADH and ALDH enzymes that metabolize ethanol alcohol
i forget which one is which but one of them metabolizes ethanol into a molecule that makes you sick and have hangovers and the other one metabolizes that one
i don't have as much experience with this side of bio
jane, thoughts?
but if she's throwing up, she's at least expelling some out of her system?
idk how safe they've been
yeah...
that's a lil concerning
i stole her alcohol last time
in the past I've just confiscated everyone's alcohol
she hasn't thrown up in the past
no
Idk, but my guess is no
wel
no
is it normal for Emi to drink this much?
just stay safe
alright well I don't control you
alcohol can intensify those problems if you have them already but it shouldn't cause anything else
you're fine unless you already deal w ibuprofen side effects
that article, as well as p much anything you'll find, says what I said
fair enough
hangovers are a bitch, I'm just tryna help
but anyway, don't do anything stupid folks
but there's a reason why oral dosage is so much higher than IV
alright then
i know
do not
please
I took a neuropharmacology class
I can't say I know much about this, but please take care of yourselves
just so we clear
THAT DOESNT MAKE IT OKAY
BUT
but first pass on oral drugs tends to minimize a ton of impacts
https://www.verywellhealth.com/can-you-drink-alcohol-while-taking-ibuprofen-4122470
i don't mean this as enabling
also um
a normal dosage isn't gonna do that much unless you already have problems w ibuprofen
it can also fuck up your liver or give you gastrointestinal problems
Alcohol can cause irritation to intestines and stomach and ibuprofen numbs the pain when you need to know if you're in pain
as a general rule tho you are correct
w alcohol
ibuprofen is safe
with dilated veins you lose a lot of heat in cold or get a lot without noticing
or extreme cold
Drink water and get some rest, guys
Also do not mix alcohol with hot tubs either
_Do not mix alcohol with other drugs ever_
Alcohol does a lot of stuff with dilating veins and as a depressant it doesn't mix well with even harmless drugs like caffeine
^yeah, that's what I was thinking
EVER
DO NOT MIX ALCOHOL WITH OTHER DRUGS
Doesn't Advil go bad with alcohol?
you'll thank me tomorrow
if y'all have any
take an advil
We love you, so please take care of yourself and get some rest
alrighty then

^
we can put the guy behind us
truth
why waste energy on an asshole ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
but i think i’ve wasted enough of my concern on him
you guys i love y’all
I don't have words to describe what a dick move that is
I am angry on your behalf
i think we’ve established that he’s not worth any of our anger or time
you know what guys it’s okay
I'm extraordinarily concerned cuz this is borderline sociopathic
What the actual hell. No one in there right minds does that. What the actual fuck.
<@460689096646590465> ok, I just saw this, but that is the shittiest fucking move that bitch could have possibly pull out of his ass, so fucking fuck that son of a bitch
yes right???? hes purposely being a shitbag and im not here for it
Ok I thought at first that he was probably just oblivious but no this is like targeted what the fuck
thats such a pathetic move i literally cant
why the hell is he a trick ass bitch whats his motive
if you want to talk to him go for it but like
i doubt he'll be very helpful
fuck that shit
emily
you can create private stories
how does that work wtf?
and whut?
WHY?
WAIIIIIIIT
<@460689096646590465> why???
Wait what
only i can see it?
he posted another video of the girl on snap but the problem is
he
we're always here if you still need us
alright, but be sure to get some sleep and stay hydrated when you can <@!460689096646590465>
thanks
i’m going to shut up and watch a lot of netflix now
that's why we're not obstructing your actions
we trust you
so trust me guys i can make rational decisions
and the last time i got aggressively motivated and productive i got a job and volunteered at the library so i know where to put my energy
of course, it's worth giving yourself some time just to recollect yourself before you have to do it, but that's super valid
that's valid
but i do have to call off prom and siv and i’d rather drop him before he drops me
besides i’m too self aware and aware of future consequences to Actually do anything mean or dangerous or Major Bitchlike
lmao i’m too soft to actually do anything
<@!460689096646590465> if you're emotions ever derail, we'll let you know and help you work them out. for now, it's fine (as long as you're not literally slashing tires as we speak), and it's healthy to acknowledge how you're feeling in the moment to better understand the situation
goodnight
i'll talk to y'all later
ultimately my decisions are reasonable and well thought out
just don't mind me
idk
but i think it's just turning into a potentially unhealthy cycle?
i'm not tired of it
I get that it gets old after a bit Salina but you don't have to listen if you're tired of it
<@!460689096646590465> you feel what you need to feel right now. your emotions just take time, so give them time.
give me 12 and i'll be better
i appreciate the concern. i'm keeping an eye on it.
its been 4 hours
do what you guys think is best
don't mind me
idk
i know, but you can see kinda a sin wave progression in this chat
i dont expect it to be a continuous thing, but it's valid to acknowledge anger. this is something that happened literally hours ago.
idk sorry
on the other hand, i don't think getting continually riled up over it is really healthy?
on one hand, i get it
idk
"productivity" is a little vague in this context, but that's ok
i don't know if there is a productive thing to do rn
it's an expression of support
<@!340319804747415553> it's not necessarily productive, but it doesn't necessarily need to be at this moment
i don't think it's the most productive
as much as i love y'all and as cathartic as this is
uh
H
<@!460689096646590465> robots dont usually have lungs either
at the end of the day, ya dodged a bullet
_suffocate_
i can still crush his lungs
if he doesn't have a heart
hey
seeing is believing
cut him open and see
only one way to find out
sdfjklajdaf
<@!520095106888630348> i don't think he has one, but it's worth a shot
make him have heart eyes for you and then _crush his heart_
that's a good thing tho, right?
...okay i've reached the stage where i get aggressively independent and motivated
as usual
and im gonna look hot
im going
oh no
that's what we're here for
oh ok i thought you meant you were just straight up not going
thank
<@!460689096646590465> we support every decisions you make and will always be there for you. we're always happy to listen.
yeah that
she's not gonna go with him
wait what?
but uh yeah my life is in shambles thanks for listening
im calling off prom and siv tomorrow with arya bc i don't trust myself to be rational over text
that's a super fair point
players
fuckin bitch
what kind of jackass puts videos of girls on their snapchat with hearts anyway
in case it wasnt clear
i hate this as well
fucking bitch
i do too
i hate this
i will fite this guy
<@!460689096646590465> cut him

Im 100% in support of you whatever you do emily
Forget this irrelevant boy and date a college MAN who cares abt your feelings
Humans, as blastopores, develop assholes first thing in the womb. Some people never move past that stage and remain an asshole theoughout their sad lives
y i. k e
hard to yeet something up his ass if his whole being is the ass
What a scumbag
Maybe he can take his head outta it for once
better
Yeet it up his ass
i’m gonna yeet one of those stone lion things through his window
jeesoo
Im sorry about this bullshit emi you deserve the entire universe not this fuckboy crap
Guess assholes never change
Oh man just read this channel.
I will bring turtles and a blanket to any friend in a time of need
we're here for you Emi!
No, no, it's ok! That's what we're here for. I'm actually glad to hear that we're able to help.

food fight where we aim for our mouths
Eat food like normal people

<@520095106888630348> ok, then maybe just a food party in general, cuz I don't think anyone can eat this many sweets
i can throw flour at you
i can't bake sorry
<@460689096646590465> I will shower you w cookies
Yes!!
Yo I’m down for whatever
Whatever you need to feel better
If that's something you'd want
<@460689096646590465> We can do a baked goods sesh to cheer you up sometime
And I've never done cake
I used to be super good at macarons, but it's been a while, so idk

Ooh I'm good at macarons
Although I wanna do macarons again

I'd be more than happy to bake things with y'all
Did someone say cookies
Hi

Damn

he lives near jeesoo
How many eggs is the real question 🤔
I have leftover eggs from baking

we _can_ egg his car
can we egg his car
^
<@460689096646590465> We're happy to talk to you whenever you need our help or support
maybe don't listen to me
i told you to fuck morals and smash in his windows so
if you listen to anyone probably listen to David
i mean
lol
Don't think I would be able to do that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
actually i’m stubborn i wouldn’t actually listen to you
from now on you guys can make my decisions for me
<@!261949028994908170> speaks only the truth
are so right
you
Easier said than done, but the faster you can forget about him in your life the better
He's not worth your time
fuck him
_what the fuck??_
_Don't wanna lose you_
There are a lot of thing he should have done differently, and I am so sorry you had to deal with that
Yeah, that's kind of an ass move and p oblivious on his part
“you should come to the party” so i can see you make out with a girl yeah i’m so down
him and his stupid “but you are different” and “i don’t wanna lose you” bullshit fuckface stop playing
That doesn't make what he did any less of an oof, and your emotions are definitely still valid
it wasn’t like he cheated anyway i’m just gonna die i guess
you know what fine he had the right to besides _we were never together_ so what the hell
Fuck him indeed. I'm so sorry.
it’s Whatever i shouldn’t give a damn he can make out with the world for all i care fuck him
fuck morals _I'm_ going to smash in his windows
_he did what_
so fuck it all
we’re not together
but then again
invite me to a party (i didn’t go) where he made out with another girl
You're a wonderful human being, and you don't deserve this
<@!460689096646590465>
what did he do?
I'm sorry.
What's wrong?
there’s nothing to talk about i’m stupid he’s an asshole fuck him
Morals are good
when you’re angry but you also have morals
<@460689096646590465> wanna talk about it?
Oh, ok
Ok, maybe don't destroy property
okay i won’t
i’m great i’m gonna smash his car windows in
i hope you're ok <@!460689096646590465>
i'm so sorry i didn't see this, i muted this channel
Hi, sorry, I just saw this, but I hope things are getting better. Please remember we're always here to talk and support you if you need to listen.
And rushing doesn’t really help
It takes time
Just let things cool off
But yeah, take your time and take it easy
That’s totally valid
Fair
ok i’ll probably talk to him eventually but right now f u c k h i m
We’re here for you <3
no fuck him
Agree
And men do suck
Either way we are here for you + love and support you
Unless you decide you're totally done and it's just not worth it anymore, which is also valid
I still recommend talking to him about it, I know that sounds like the Worst Idea Ever right now but you should figure out what he thought, whether he knew what he was doing etc. It'll help him do better in the future and it should help you get closure, bc as shitty as this seems, there's still room for doubt; he did try to invite you, for example
fuck him fuck this fuck everything love isn’t real i knew how this was going to be and i did nothing to stop myself i’m done whatever
they suck
i hate men
h
after consulting my best friend i’m feeling better but also
(whale groan)
Alright that’s perfectly fair
i’m in the angry phase
I’m sorry D:
Emiiiii
Oooooof
You ok emi?
wat
Oh noooo
i don’t even know what to say
I'm here to talk if you need someone to talk to <@460689096646590465>
Do you wanna talk about it?
no
Are you doing ok?
<@460689096646590465> I'm sorry...
turns out he was making out with someone at the party
okay
Puppies are very well defined symbols of precious happiness
Cuz puppies
Ok true
clearly defined boundaries
that's not a gray area
like when i texted matthew bellevia something about puppies and he sent me a heart
but gray areas exist
When?
yeah
sometimes you just know its platonic
and it's the most awkward thing of all time
I've had to clarify that a few times
No
are you making fun of me
good god
❤ 
(For the sake of clarity and comedy, this is a completely platonic heart)
we're here for you no matter what lmao
it's fine if you are sad
i swear im gonna come to gene's tomorrow composed and normal and not sad
❤
for real tho
anyway im feeling significantly better so thanks for that
Aren't we all
what a mess
Well
I should maybe go do that right now
Uh
Oh
managebac
essay reflections
oh god
What were we supposed to upload?
lmfao
did all 3 of us fuck up?
Uh
see kids boys are distracting
Oh shoot
I FORGOT TO UPLOAD
I forgot to do reflections
its how i think okay
oh FUCK
ew
😃
like writing a TOK essay
that makes sense
so like. be careful, be guarded if you need to be, but be as straightforward as possible, don't leave room for interpretation
(I lowkey feel like that's what happened when noah asked me to hoco)
That's valid, but your comfort in the situation also matters
idk I'm pushy about that bc I feel like it's worse if you ask but he misconstrues it and lets you down later
like
and no uncertain terms
Well, glad to hear you found a way where you're comfortable
noted
as long as you're direct
yeah no
bc thats
without being completely vulnerable that is
Hey, that's awesome!
I'm glad
to him i mean
well in the course of this conversation i think i kind of figured out how i can bring this up
we love you
That's what we do best
that makes me feel better actually
okay
big facts
Caps lock came off more aggressively than I intended
EXPRESSING, SHARING, AND UNDERSTANDING EMOTIONS IS LIKE THE DEFINITION OF MATURITY
to be able to express that and know when you could use another opinion
and imo, it's a mark of maturity
that's literally the point of this channel
don't feel bad about talking about and seeking help/advice regarding your problems
^^^^
that's what we're for, no?
also yeah this isn't particularly petty. people are complicated, fragile creatures, and your emotions are very valid. you're not bringing us down just bc you're a bit torn up about this, and even if you were, we help each other up in times of need
(what you are worth is having someone to always talk to regardless of the situation because your friends are willing to help. And yes, I will keep stressing this, cuz this is important, and I will say it until your head hurts)
you're worth more than that
but he's not worth 4 months of quiet suffering
the obvious and practical solution is always scary
1. you will likely inevitably get more attached because you haven't severed that connection yet, you're still going on those maybe-dates with the question lingering in the back of your head
2. if you're right it'll hurt like an absolute bitch after that + you'll feel way worse about letting it sit; if you're wrong it stops you from fully enjoying the moment, you'll spend too many nights agonizing about it all
3. you'll just never know for sure. which, honestly, sucks the most. and chances are he won't learn anything from this whole thing.
This is not petty. Just because it's not productive doesn't mean it doesn't matter. Very few things should matter in your life over your emotions.
And you should never have to worry about me. I'm happy to talk to you about these things. If anything, I'd be more concerned if you didn't come to me with problems every now and then, because I know we all have them.
all this energy could go into something productive. that's what makes it petty
it's a petty problem just shush
This is not at all a petty problem
gene i know you'll always be there but im reluctant to burden people with petty problems ( this is part of the reason i mope around for hours before eventually giving in and throwing my baggage all over you guys)  and make them feel down because im down
3 problems w suffering in silence
(not that I disagree with Cindy tho)
But ultimately your feelings and you having someone to talk to matters more than the logistics
but I really really do urge you to just get this over with
that too
Honestly, I can't speak for anyone else here but I'll try so correct me if I'm wrong, but if you did choose to wait the four monfh, it doesn't mean we're suddenly not your friends or people you can't talk to about this. We're always here to listen and make sure you're doing well. Again whatever you do, do it for you. We'll be there for you regardless.
good advice i will take it
^^
do it for you
we'd much prefer you to suffer a day or two, get over him, and be happy
don't think about us
i mean the only thing really stopping me from suffering for four months is the fact that i end up dragging all the people i care about with me and i really don't want yall to suffer but if it was just me and i had no choice but to quietly be in pain all the time i would take that
but as your friends
no
It's not weird.
is it weird that i honestly feel like i'd rather suffer for four months
It's a separate point but worth restating
i know
And just to reiterate this, because regardless of our advice, this is the most important thing, remember what happens, we're always here for you and ready to support you. If the uncertainty is getting to you, remember we can at least be a certainty you can rely on if things go wrong.
thats a fair approach
history doesn't have to totally repeat itself
be the girl who might be disappointed, but points out to him how his actions can be misconstrued and how he can maybe improve in the future
ofc not
don't be the girl who screams at him and shit talks him to others
I'm hoping that our unanimous advice will get you to maybe follow through
Your feelings are completely valid here, but we don't want you to be suffering in uncertainty forever
I know you're not dumb, I'm sure you've ended up at the same conclusion
And if confrontation is what's holding you back, again, work up to it
closure is important, you know for sure, you can move on
look you guys are making good points and it's the same point i keep reaching whenever i think this through alone.  i know you guys don't think im dumb. you know that im thinking the same things as you guys. but when i do consider bringing it up to him, i feel like im a replay of what happened with that other girl. so like what's the point. and you're gonna be all "but it'll give you peace of mind" and im gonna be like honestly? i don't see that as a gain. in fact, i feel like if i were him and that whole scenario just happened again but with a different girl i'd be pretty fucking annoyed. because he doesn't see how he leads people on. i think that this is just how he treats female friends and he just doesn't know. maybe i should just stay quiet and deal?
With any relationship, be it romantic, a friendship, family, etc., communication and understanding of problems between both parties are vital
from the other side
all I know is that that story was painfully familiar to me
I don't know enough to say
and again, he might genuinely be into you
I agree with everything Cindy just said
but it will hurt so much less in the long run
^^^^
work your way up to it, plan out what you're gonna say if you need to
that's not a good metric
❤ 
We do this all the time in here
without any flirty intention
I send heart emojis to people I consider good friends
and I know it seems like history repeating itself
and I know it's terrifying
I know we've all already been saying this
It's a hindsight thing, but he's not working with hindsight
just get it over with
if that's the case
he's aware of what happened w the girl NOW
I'm aware of it NOW
i have reached that conclusion
I totally have been
HE MAY BE COMPLETELY UNAWARE
at least you're aware of it though
the main issue I guess I'm trying to point out is that
I am 100% guilty of what this guy did to that girl and I've done it by accident multiple times. I've been accused of leading people on, and I've felt absolutely fucking awful about it afterwards because I can totally see where they're coming from. but I also do have, for example, male friends that I will link arms with and hug all the time and hang out with one-on-one in public
If you need to
here's the thing
god ok this is awkward
Allow yourself to get acquainted with the fear, and then you'll be more comfortable and less affected by it
Which is an emotion
love that song
^n
ah that one
it's called the fear of the unknow
That's ok. If you need some time, you need some time. Emotions are valid.
enlighten me
I do
i don't know whats stopping me
Would you be comfortable sharing an example of a text?
*but*
then...
noah everything you're going to say to me and you're saying to me right now is exactly what im thinking
ask
this really only has one answer
anyway
no one asked u
... sh noah
why are you roasting yourself
<@!340319804747415553> I don't trust your opinion on attractiveness
look okay last time, I tried to give you advice from the perspective of the guy
rip
sometimes you just have to jump
then he'd better be really fucking hot because all i'm getting from this is lukewarm
because im stubborn and dumb i thought we talked about this
uncertainty is worse
why, you'd rather drag it out?
yeah
you need to
considering what happened with "the other girl" im not sure i want to ask
but he's cold and im not used to that kind of attitude
but ask in no uncertain terms what you two are
I WOULD
<@193229269076279298> not now
listen i would normally ask
sh
no its helpful
NOAH
I'm sorry I'm blunt
noah's being mean to me
If you're comfortable
noah, shush
sigh
can you give an example of something he's said that makes you think that?
just ask then
-_-
Flirty emojis?
and the things he says to me makes me think he's playing me
he sends me heart emojis and flirty emojis and shit
Oh boi
T
i know what flirting looks like
i can't screenshot them but uh im not stupid
oh boiiii
text messages
Alright
BUT THEN OH BOY
makes sense
i interpreted this as okay we're friends that's chill NOT A DATE
rip
and basically this led to two conclusions: he doesn't have a lot of girl friends (friends of the female gender) because of this and he didn't want us to walk by the store together in case the manager was there and assumed he would be doing the same thing to me as he did with that other girl (if that makes sense)
so he takes 30 minutes to explain this to me
and this girl is pretty tight with her manager at that store and her manager knows him so he's kind of scared of being around that store when he's there bc the manager apparently hates him now (much like most people he and the girl were mutual friends with)
oof
but she did not think so. so anyway they get into a huge fight and she gets pissed off at him and tells everyone that he's an asshole he led her on (honestly i kinda agree with her and i told him that but whatever)
he thought they were just friends
you guessed it
and he was like
L
Ok
shhhh questions later
then one day she asks him how he thinks of her
Linked arms?
like they'd do most things together they talked a lot they linked arms when they walked around together yay power of friendship blah blah blah
apparently there's this girl that works there. she and him used to be super close friends
er rip
thus begins the story
and i was like "????? what?"
eventually we just walk by the store like normal persons and he's like "okay that wasn't so bad"
so we were at bellevue square and we were walking by that korean make up store. out of nowhere he stops in his tracks and im like "are you good?" and he's like "can you walk in front of me i'll catch up"
can't be worse than noah insinuating anything and everything about his dick anyway
Forgot about that
Oh, or the nsfw channel
If it is, we'll just move to the video call chat literally designed for TMI stuff and keep listening, cuz it's still important
mmk
stop me if its TMI
i'll be up for a bit too
So we're all ears
I'm here all night if you need me
oh boi
alright buckle up i gotta get on my laptop for this
I'm sorry
well now I'm curious
and it was not a good story
this scenario is oddly reminiscent of something he told me the first time we met in person
Don't hold it against yourself
It'll come in time
People's personalities are contradictory
look. all i know is that when i feel like i figured out something about him he does or says something that contradicts that. i don’t know him at all
Also, what Cindy said is valid as well
He'll never learn to understand you (or anyone for that matter) if he can't try. Even if it goes poorly, it's a two-way street, and you'd be working with him to solve a problem.
it's okay
people are complicated
okay great now i’m contradicting myself in my head
what if i don’t think he’s an understanding person
But he'll at least understand that if you're not feeling well, it's a concern
There's nothing wrong with that
it doesn’t make Sense
he’s not like you guys or any of my friends exactly i don’t even know why we’re friends if we wanna talk about personalities and compatibility we are polar opposites
he’s so closed off and blunt
Don't worry about boring us. That's not happening.
If he tells you he prefers it straightforward, I would also say he would hope/trust that you have the ability to talk to him about your emotions because he acknowledges it's not his strength and therefore may need your help
to be tmi, I ask Salina a stupid number of questions all the time about how she's feeling
what
like noah
or be annoyingly detailed
bc i just don’t wanna bore you guys to death
tell me if you need more details
L
but then that got confusing over time bc Mixed Signals
but he also told me a long ass story that i interpreted as “we’re just friends”
no gene you’re right i mean he Told Me he likes things straightforward
a lot of people suck at it
Granted, very case by case, but point stands
^
^^
If he isn't very emotionally literate, sometimes that means it could help him too to be more direct about them
he can’t read emotions
read
are you saying he's not sure how to express his emotions?
Mb
i was joking
Ok, that isn't the reason, but I get what you're saying
oof!
Oof
what can i say he’s on level
It makes sense
that’s part of the problem. he’s not very. emotionally literate if that makes sense
you know
The fact that you can recognize and acknowledge is meaningful
rip
uh
harder to break me
i was thinking a brick
exactly
salina i’m small
Oof
That's ok
throw me
hey
i have an overwhelming urge to throw something and break it
And don't let yourself feel bad because of your emotions. Trust me when I say that they're a strength. I'm friends with y'all cuz I believe you guys are actually able to recognize and interpret your emotions, and that's the most helpful thing in this situation.
we have limits
but
we're sappy
trust me
it's true
lol
<@!340319804747415553> I feel like this is untrue
suck it noah
consider yourself special
you guys already know i appreciate it
i'm not even this sappy with noah
❤
we really do
we wuv u
<3
ah yes cue the waterworks
synchronized affirmation
great minds think alike
hah
If it matters to you, then it deserves to matter
it matters to you so it matters to us
but it does matter to you
we've got your back
this shouldn’t even matter
That's what we're here for
you don't get to feel bad
like gene said we're here for you
no
don't
i feel kind of bad because you guys are so helpful and taking this so seriously
Also, emotions are a strength if anything
Cindy's right. If you need to work up to it, do that. There's nothing wrong with having emotions or feeling reluctant. While asking him is helpful, your emotions come first and are the most important thing.
is not a weakness
being emotional
hey
but that’s just me so what can i do
it would be easier if i weren’t emotional like this
it's never an easy thing to do
then try to work up to it I guess
If it makes sense but your emotions tell you not to, it's ok to give yourself some time to just let yourself feel more comfortable first
i don’t know if i can be vulnerable like this around him yet
yeah vulnerability is hard
i’m reluctant to
all I can say is be honest and open
Whatever happens, just remember that we're all always here for you whenever and wherever you need us, no matter what happens.
the thing is i know that asking makes complete sense
I'm saying it's best to just be straightforward here I think, don't try to play games or "test" him etc, that'll just prolong the uncertainty
no i know dw
Alright, just wanted to check
<@!460689096646590465> your feelings are extremely valid and that wasn't what I meant
I'm not saying they're not
I wouldn't call this bullshit though. Her feelings are valid.
proceed w caution
if he says he's for real
could save you a lot of hurt
cut the bullshit, get to the point
Cindy's right that asking him could be very helpful, but if you're not comfortable with it right now, it's valid to try to give yourself some time if you're worried about this being a sad boi hours thing
I think, though obviously it's easier said than done, that you should just ask him
or he could be using you or whatever
he could just want a senior-year-fling, but is genuinely into you
he's already asked you to siv and prom, yes? he could be for real, 4 months is a p long commitment for someone you're just toying with
that sounds like you're not sure and that, imo, is the issue here, uncertainty will kill you more than an answer either way
you said you think you already know, but you're also questioning whether it's just your sad boi hours speaking right
If it's still bothering you
Yeah, that makes me think it's not a one-off sad-boi hours thing
so valid i guess
well it sprouted from last night
rip
Granted, slightly different situation, but I think you mentioned/alluded to it
why yes i was concerned last night too
i’m just gonna listen and think
and it doesn't have to be
Well, weren't you concerned about this last night as well?
I feel like you're describing this like an inevitable cycle
rip
i don’t know just keep saying what’s on your mind
yeah i would know
assumptions are full of shit
what if it’s just my sad boi hours speaking
interrupt me if u need to correct me
emi seems really torn up overall
Valid
i think the "just ditch him now" is the challenge
^^
if not I'd ask
if you're really sure about what he's like just ditch him now
Are those four (three?) months something you really wanna commit to this if you're gonna feel this uncomfortable about it?
it's not worth it to drag it out
especially when emotions are involved
four months is lot of time
save yourself the pain of getting increasingly attached?
why should i ask when it’s all going to be over in four months anyway
but i feel like i already know the answer
Having emotions, doubts, and fears isn't immature. The fact that you recognize them is mature in itself
but better now than after dragging this out
and you said the confirmation is what you're scared of
but like chances are you'll get your answer
of course, he could lie
we're all the same age
to be very honest I think my advice would just be to ask him outright what he wants from you
you're not being immature lol
alright, so then i'm sorry but i want to get down to the crux of things
it’s just petty teenage drama
You're not being immature at all
I'm sorry though. It sucks that you have to go through that.
idk i’m being so immature and i hate it
it’s fine i’m comfortable with you guys knowing things
you don't have to disclose if you don't wanna
no it’s okay
second option
sorry, that's kinda prying
is it the thoughts themselves or the idea that they could be confirmed
what part of it gets to you
or rather i guess what i'm asking is
it’s just me
yeah i think so
is it the overthinking that really gets to you?
and it’s just something i do
unnecessary drama
it’s just
There's nothing wrong with that. Don't hold it against yourself.
i’m over dramatic so ofc i overthink
and then i overthink
in the moment
^^^
i’m not uncomfortable. it’s just weird bc when its just me and him i’m okay and he’s a relatively nice person
There's nothing wrong with being emotionally attached, and you shouldn't hold it against yourself, but you also shouldn't put yourself in a position where you're uncomfortable
more of the implications, rather than your relationship itself
i don’t know
i don’t know
you seem very fearful and uncomfortable
bc i’m annoyingly emotionally attached
Don't do anything you're uncomfortable with though
because you really seem to be agonizing over it
i don’t really have a reason to say no
are you sure you want to do this?
:(
and i don’t know why
and i don’t want to say no
and then it’s gonna keep happening for the next four months because he’s my date to siv and he asked me to prom
aw :(
well, there's nothing wrong with being soft and squishy
and i know that in the morning i’m going to be okay again and i’m gonna keep rolling with whatever he’s playing at
i saw this coming and it was avoidable but ofc i have to be soft and give everyone the benefit of the doubt
i have been in the same corner before and it really does fucking suck
Hindsight is 20/20. Don't kick yourself too hard for this (or at all really).
because it really is tough
i’m so much smarter than this and i totally saw this from a mile away
We're here to help. You're not hurting anyone
i'm just sad that you have to go through this
no you're not hurting me
i’m a wreck sorry
i don’t mean to hurt you
i’m sorry
even now i don’t know what he wants from me i don’t know his intentions he’s confusing
this is breaking my heart :(
I'm so sorry...
like
aw emi im sorry
and i’m dumb i thought it would be fine i thought he would just ghost me and leave me alone but he didn’t leave me alone he kept saying things that sound nice but maybe they’re not so nice
everyone told you what?
Well, I have to disagree with "everyone" here then
but it IS because everyone told me so
do i need to shank him?
it's not your fault, hun
i'm with gene
it's okay
It's not your fault
it’s always like this
Don't blame yourself for it
i’m so fucking dumb when it comes to boys
no, just human
i’m dumb
delightful
it’s Fine i mean i shouldn’t have let myself get so attached
ah, and the capitals come out to play
it’s about The Boy
I'm sorry. You don't deserve this.
is there anything in particular that you want to talk about/address?
i think we've all been there
and it isn't
but it’s not bc i was right
and i tell myself it’s in my head
and then i let myself believe
like people are like “emily it’s in your head you always do this to yourself you never let yourself be happy” and then i’m like yeah you’re right i deserve to be happy i shouldn’t torture myself like this
and it happens and it sucks
I'm sorry
because that's human nature
why do i always have to be right when it’s something bad
it's really frustrating
i know
i hate it though
Is there something that set you off?
i like the humor
if you trust your gut, go with it
h it’s k
sorry i'll stop
out of a sample size of...?
i mean i don’t Know but i have a gut feeling and my gut feelings about men have a track record of 100% correct all the time
dis bitch be a real bitch
Who dis bitch
and i'll win
have you ever been played by a guy who’s just Bored
i'll fight him too
Boi what
I'll fight him
bitch what'd he do
do you want to talk about it?
aw :(
i am being played like a violin and i know it
Or just someone to listen
^^^
We're here to talk if you need some help
you seemed a bit out of it with some earlier messages too
you doing alright?
jokes aside
jk
Is everything alright? <@460689096646590465>
you set yourself up for disappointment
because
why do men constantly disappoint me
agreed. i have other points, and i'm sure you do too. let's just walk away from it.
doesn't matter
but anyway
i didn't move into the chain until you actually fucked with a lot of what i did
i didn't realize they were chains until i was almost done deleting tbh
i thought it was really funny at first, but eh
i'm not saying that this makes it any better, but you also destroyed my chains
also, i spent a lot of time cleaning it up cuz it was funny at first, but then you went into the actual chain and destroyed it
we were in a swing and had a mutual understanding that took some time to establish
and so is time
and effort is really subjective
i wouldn't say almost at the end
it took time, effort, and collaboration. also, we were almost at the end.
shrug
look it wasn't necessary but tbh it also wasn't necessary for you you to take it that seriously?
thank u
ceasefire
but yes
you don't think we were annoyed by your pettiness??? why was ruining the group effort necessary smh
now bye
so i will fight for it
i'm getting p annoyed by the pettiness
but it does
this means way more to me than it should
and if you want an explanation, it's because salina destroyed a beautiful moment that we all worked very hard on
but anyway
i was content to leave it there
when i cleanedit up
im v tired of this
tbh

good call
if you're any indication of what dating noah does to a person, i think i'll pass
you sure want me to fuck him
for someone who's also vying for noah's attention
you know
someone needed to take it away from you
good
<@!340319804747415553> i had one dream in life, and you took it away from me
delightful
i love the smell of desperate copying and pasting in the morning
ah
thank you?
and a challenge
at least fucking noah would be interesting
copy+paste motherfucker
surprise bitch <@!340319804747415553>

the point is comfortable silence and the spilling of tea once every three hours
I'm down but idk if I'll talk much
Sure, but for a little bit
we still wanna video call @here?
Again, I think they're just grateful I actually have friends
It wasn't even Netflix lol
<@!258094439636008971> your parents like us because you went back and deleted it from your netflix history
*concern*
<@472541429130854421> as the porn connoisseur you obviously are, do you have a better suggestion
we're delightful Gene
Again, I truly wonder why my parents actually like you guys
lmao I'm down
Somebody pull up 50 shades of gray and have a watch party outside Gene's house
I will boot out anyone who tries to watch it this Sunday
like porn with no real spiciness but a lot of production money to spare
we already agreed it is subpar porn
didn't y'all already do that
We should all get together and watch it properly
<@520095106888630348> 50 shades of grey has a movie ya know. You could just watch that.
it's like an awk book to read in public
i'm reading a book for bio ec
Ok
I'm down gimme like 10 mins
Or play music together?
@here anyone bored and wanna video call?
it's ok. if i can finish some more french before school starts and not get shreded for being behind in english, i'll probably be fine.
oof i'm sorry
yeah i'm gonna take a lot of Ls today
sorry guys it looks like we actually have school today
Fuck
Welp

I'm almost there
mood honestly
g'night, guys

I hope you're doing ok now
Aww, I'm sorry

it's sleepy time
oooooo boi it's sad boi hours
Get that sweet sweet hit of dopamine
I'll talk to ya later
I gotta go eat dinner, so maybe food will help
True
Need electrons
Retrieve 2 H20 for photolysis
I'll try my best
Hahaha thanks
A B S O R B
I'll go see what I can do. Thanks.
Maybe I'm just a bit dehydrated
Yeah, that's fair
Water?
It's 7:00 and not really an option
Go to sleep
I have like the weirdest headache right now
<@193229269076279298> what's that?
I have no fucking clue how to get through my life, and I'm astonished you guys seem to at least kinda know
With the same organization strategy as the US military
Sorry for being super dramatic all the time but like
Like life in general
Semi-serious question but how do you people do *this*?
T h an k
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETy6NQSiPx0
Do it already
_hard reset_
I've embraced my fate
Hold nothing back
* takes out baseball bat *
looks like we're going to have to do with with brute force then
Damn
And when I say a few, I mean everything
Wait, I think I deleted a few things on accident
you're gonna see the lil 💤 icon
Alright now what
go to settings
My body is shutting down. How do I restart and check for updates. I'm still on v1.0.0.
They ended up very much hospitalized
But it also shuts down your kidneys
I forget who, but someone told me they knew someone who actually drank bleach
Antifreeze works too
that might keep you down longer than a year
<@!340319804747415553> maybe that's what your body is trying to do
Or a bottle of bleach
<@!258094439636008971> idk however much the drugs cost
But the trial is the lead in to the purchase to the real subscription
No like a full year-long subscription to death
Yeah
`free trial of death` means it's free
also
idk 8 hours of time ideally?
How much does a subscription cost?
What a great free trial
yes
ergo
sleeping = free trial of death
Rip?
Well, I, for one, do not feel much of a difference, but my opinion probably has significantly less value here.
but do you feel dead when <@373181327916269568> is around?
Does that mean it helps you sleep more? Cuz in that case, his advice just leads into yours.
Rip
i never nap more than i do than when cole is around
<@!193229269076279298> lies
<@520095106888630348> I'll make sure to get my share of temporary death tonight then. Thank you.
<@193229269076279298> That sounds both fundamentally flawed and highly inaccessible, but I guess it checks out for some people.
relationships
sleeping?
Feeling dead
Uh
Not
Do you guys have any recommendations for like
Night then ❤
G'night for reals this time
I would try to explain in depth, but my brain is a little bit of a mush right now, and I should probably sleep. Maybe some other time. Besides, y'all need to sleep as well.
I'm doing a bit better now thank you. It did help tho. I need to do that every now in then.
Much love + if you wanna talk I'm still up
Glad I could help (??) Hope you're doin ok
Aw gene
Anyways, g'night, people. My dreams will be really interesting after all that sad boi music lol.
One of these days, we'll invent self-charging phone with small, built-in generators, and I'll never sleep
<@503787499605458954> congrats, you got a sad boi to do that thing where you kinda just lie down in bed and do nothing but listen to music, reflect on your life, and cry for over an hour until your phone is about to die. Thank you.
Well, I love listening to music and getting recommended music, so I'll take it, hahaha
like to an obnoxious degree

I have a swipy thing on my phone, so my typos tend to be pretty bad
Autocorrect big dumb
Whoops
Yeah
*mean?
Oh, ok, I see what you mean now, hahaha.
but they're all very relationshippy
i def have some lean into the feels music
i just have a lot of very sappy music
Well, alright. I respect that if you think so then. You know if better than I do. Thanks anyways.
tbh i really don't think you'd like my music
I'll take whatever I can get?
Uh
depends on what you count as sad boi
eh
Anyone have some good sad boi songs?
I guess I'll just be productive tomorrow and feel dead on the inside lol
At least I made some nice friends and had some good laughs along the way though
This was not how things were supposed to go lol
mood
I don't know how I do these things to myself
I'm really unproductive
Wow
I just looked at all the things I need to do, and I realized
That's an L
F
i know parts of bellevue are out
rip?
Which is odd, cuz we usually go down first
Not a flicker in sight
Pretty steady over here actually
got some flickers
mine almost did
Nope
did anyone's power go out btw
Hmmm
so he's having a fun time
he got dc'd out of a few matches earler
oh rip
idk if he's sleeping or internet down
understand
yeah I do not
That boi doesn't sleep at normal hours
but that's no surprise
Well, I wish the best for y'all nonetheless.
And no problem.
quiet bc noah's off the grid
how's everyone else's sad boi hours going
thanks gene
lol i don't do anything
I hope things do ease off soon so you guys can take a break from it and get some rest though. You guys work so hard, and y'all really deserve it.
I respect, but I'm also sorry for that.
but d r a m a r a m a
Fair
doesn't affect me really
eh
Also, drama is an L
Well, just because it might not be the biggest thing in the grand scheme of things doesn't invalidate whatever you guys are feeling or going through. So for that, I'm sorry you're having to deal with that.
but I think it'll be ok
oh me too
oh well
it's mostly simmered down but i still have concerns
but it's not really affecting anything
lol tea
other drama underlying it
also
don't worry bout me lmao
I'm p much fine
again though
we've still got 2 months to go and I'm already a bit tired of it all
and I'm also worried that it'd crush him to lose
bc I feel like that's the main thing holding him back
basically my co-president and good friend is running for lieutenant governor, I'm serving as a campaign manager again, and I'm both a lil frustrated by how slow things have been moving and a bit worried for his stress/anxiety/mindset
I mean, it sounds like you're trying everything you can to help
Hmmm
I keep that in perspective but idk if others do
in the words of a wise former college sophomore, "it's a high school debate club"
it's honestly not a big deal in the grand scheme of things
If you're comfortable talking about it
Everything alright?
I'm just worried for someone else
nah like I'm fine
Is there anything I could do to help?
lol it's all good
Oh, I'm sorry
I already kinda ranted to salina
campaigns are stressful
kinda just some jsa stuff
What's making this sad boi's sad boi hours sad this sad boi hours?
Oof
sad
How's everyone's sad boi hours?
So
Same
just busy
no
he's slow
damn
u wrong
the knife has been in progress for a month
uh
Noah spent 3 weeks making a chocolate dildo. He also spent 3 weeks making Salina a knife. If i end up dead. You know who did it
wait I'm confuzzled
but that's how long it took him to find this one
You'll find a chocolate dildo
no
"any new laptops" has there been another
If you open the CD tray
what??
complete coincidence tho
i kid  u not
getting me a laptop
ok what else has noah spent three weeks on
"I'm still single, and this relationship serves as a cautionary tale as to what might happen to those who enter one. So whenever I get lonely, I think of these two, shudder, and am chill with being single another few years."
And that'd be it
WOW
GENE
That'd be my speech
LMAO
"Noah made a chocolate dildo as a gift once. He spent three weeks on it."
gabe prob can
because  the best man and the groom are gonna run away together
eh
LMAO
I totally can
they can't make an embarrassing wedding speeh
are you not worried about that Salina
boooooooo
You think Jarrett will make it another 5 years alive?
but also you're right
righi bros are a LOT more likely ngl
kidding
i don't think that'd happen
damn
if he makes jarrett best man or smth leave him at the altar
Can I not be invited to the wedding?
10 bucks says it's gabe or nicholas
if you last i'll give this speech as a toast
ask noah
can I be best man
lmfao
I lack words
i will spitefully make you the maid of honor
Wow
I
if we end up lasting
Wow
jane
jesus lmao
damn
DAMN
best - eventually dumping noah
t e a
worst - dating noah
Tea time
What is her worst, and what is her best?
F
lmao
that's noah's problem
don't want you at either
Hahaha
obligatory ironic *if you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best*
the cold does bother me tho
i'm not
<@520095106888630348> I'm so sorry you have to put up with this while sick
okay i'll stop now
sure things could get frosty, but everything turned out okay
i wasn't really a flake
but i wasn't snow bad
maybe a lil icy
and i was a chill kid
because when things are frozen, they are cool
Why would you do that
cool
For 12 years
oh
Annoying for a year
Dealing with you has been like living through the Frozen craze 12 times
also
that's how long the frozen craze existed
so give it bout a year?
mmh
<@340319804747415553> considering the quality of you puns, you make me want to let you go faster than a frozen movie
if noah was here he'd say why can't 1 and 2 be combined bc they're basically the same thing
no one wins
so
2) that's jane abuse
1) that's animal abuse
And then we will have stuffed animal day, and I'll throw a million turtles in your face
You will drink some water or tea, and you are going to like it
let it go
nah gene
I won't allow it
N O
hopefully death takes me first
because jane's gonna murder me next time she sees me
this is what we call living in the now
<@520095106888630348> If we school Friday, we'll have stuffed animal day so you can feel better.
*i hate me too dw*
you can't have present without resent!
don't forget
I'm sorry
i have never been so resentful
....
that's the tea
^salina right now
then you're gonna need to bless me
and yes tengo agua
salina im going to sneeze on you
if so, wat-er you waiting for?
Do you have water on you?
don't cat-ch any more colds
If there's a time for that, it's probably now
i'm reduced to watching cat videos in bed with a box of tissues
Oof
S T O P
running away from you
you could really say that things are...
RUNNY
Is your nose stuffy or runny? Just curious
Being sick is the worst...
I'm so sorry
Oof oh my gosh
i am drowning in SNOT
Is everything alright?
i am dying
i crave death
I literally fell asleep waiting for <@193229269076279298> to respond. I just wanna put that out there.

Damn, get some rest

September 2019
Speaking of Minecraft, Helen was still talking about setting up a Minecraft server for the group lol
really excited for MW5
I'll take your word for it
Alright, that makes sense
the core game just *feels* so good
That's oddly specific
no better game
but if you want to feel like you're walking around in a building size mechbot
the game has many flaws
most people haven't
Hm, never played it
Mech Warrior Online
MWO?
for different reasons
both amazing games
or Minecraft
MWO
You guys have a favorite video game?
I'm sure it's somewhere
That's ok
idk if i can find it again
oh geez
Which one?
what about the one of you hugging ray
Also, Jane, don't you dare use that middle school photo of me with a jacket on my head
But I also appreciate a big deep blue with hints of purple
Especially very pale blue
Icy blue is nice too
hm okay
_Is it icy blue_
I like purple-ish blue sometimes
_Tell me your secrets_
Phthalo?
And how edgy I'm feeling
Depends on my mood tbh
Also, I'm scared now
Periwinkle?
dark?
light?
Blue
what's ur favorite color
_i will dig up old dirt on you_
i'll find somethin
that's ok
No one really has a lot of photos of me tho
I have an idea for a gift for you
Hm
Oof but true
Photo albums are always super nice, but I don't have the effort for it
Noah because he killed the rest of us
Oh, that's so cool!
I'm a physical copy person
Who outlives everyone else here?
For our anniversary I made Cole a photo album
Back to the late-night question
Oof
Thanks
disposable, like you
And the baby birb photo is from a disposable camera
I have a memory box that I put photos in
<@193229269076279298> that's how people did things back in the day
I like having physical copies
So cute
why are they printed out?
B I R B S OMG
And photos of the baby birbs
F R A N
Well I found two strange photos of fran
And how old do they live to be?
Who's the last person in this server to die?
Next late-night question
Idk why but they are
They're hoppy meme animals
birbs are super dorpy
Birbs are derps and I love them
Yes
i'm not sure i have any
do you want photos of the birb
Birb
rock

Jane, stop sounding so much like yourself
_he has a lil smooshy snout_
_look at his lil squishy noooooose_
Omg
Awwwww
i spent a day watching Kitchen Nightmares one time and i spent the next hour with all my thoughts read in Gordon Ramsey's voice
Help
Complete with the occasional stuttering
Like, even my own
I'm doing that thing where I'm reading every message in everyone's voice, and I'm stuck, and it hurts
but Herc acts like Gabe
nicholas is more likely
*Nicholas
have we considered the idea that Noah is in love with Gabe
the Gabe dog?
Herc?
it's all fair game
true
and noah said that herc is cuter than me
It's p valid
<@!193229269076279298> she sold you for a dog, how does that make you feel
You can't steal another trainer's Pokemon
i love dogs more than noah
It's like Pokemon
you don't need to be so offended
Especially Skye
rip?
that's what happens when you steal someone's DOG
i feel attacked
sigh
I haven't even kicked Noah out of Cole's house and into the streets yet
LOOK
you don't care about them
Look what happened to Noah tho
you sold off your last animal in a heartbeat
i take good care of noah
YES
Are you now?
i am a good animal caretaker
woah woah woah
rip theobromine
she's gonna die in that amount of time in your care
uh that's not too good for her
it's all good
She ate like 5 chocolate cupcakes in like a minute
i'm crazy too
yo
i get my freedom
Skye is crazy
lmao good luck with that
so i get skye
and that's noah
it's what's *my* bitch
which means he still has skye
and you get skye
yeah but it's not just any bitch
then he gets you
i didn't sell myself into bondage for this trade
if you're a bitch
wait what
and also apparently you <@!340319804747415553>
Rip
then Cole gets Noah
but noah's my bitch
oh i'm a bitch
Noah's dog is just Gabe in canine form apparently
yea are you sure _you're_ not the bitch <@!340319804747415553>
Noah does
That's so mean
does no one else have a dog???
You can't just take Skye
Why Skye????
Wait wait wait
What
Wait
<@340319804747415553> cuz he's your bitch
one dog for another
bc you're my bitch ;)
DAMN
i'm ruthless
he gets your boyfriend then
:D
D a m n
no strings attached
and i have no dog so
i want cole's dog
Oof I'm sorry
hmmmm
uh
lol
i wouldn't saddle noah with my family
wait
Go
Anyways:
-you get what they have
-they get what you have
-if someone has nothing, it's a straight-up give
Oooooof
bc they're prob the least dysfunctional family
For example, I can trade Noah for his hair
can i have noah's family
You can trade 1 thing with anyone in this server
No
how big are your boobs?
Ok, time for another late-night question
G'night!
goodnight Helen!
you'd have to like not make yourself a spectacle if you want anyone to believe that <@!193229269076279298>
goodnight for reals lol
Valid
i make everything my entertainment
we are not your jester to dance for your entertainment
Encourage him
Don't
-_-
please continue
this is hilarious
sorry i meant to say that in a funny way
Same
i apologize
goodnight Helen
G'night
goodnight y'all
also i'm going to sleep
why can we never have a conversation without going down the route of dick sizes and the like
<@!193229269076279298> maybe _you've_ culminated but i don't think i ever will at this point
can't stand the truth
i hate everything about this
i don't like this
your life has culminated in this moment
what did i ever do to deserve this
why did i need to see that
I have one upped you
move your tree to the middle <@!258094439636008971>
Masterpiece
or like i rooooooooooooooooo my boat?
like kangarooooooo?
rooooo?
ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoo
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
fuck off lily briscoe
like to one-up that
i would
<@!340319804747415553>
you're prettier than I am :)
happy
*with close proximity
my chair is prettier than your chair
fine
fine
fine
just like noah isn't fucking his house
i had to one up him
that doesnt mean the firefly is fucking the jar
so sorry
not like
it surround it on all sides in the way that putting a firefly in a jar does
i hate all of you
heheh
puns
can
it
heh
`it can`
the can does not surround thte dick on all sides
<@!193229269076279298> there's a differences between enveloping something and fucking it
?
it barely surrounds
it does not surround on all sides
i regret
<@!258094439636008971> pls help get me out of this conversation
it surrounds it on all side it can
uhm
yes
does the pringles can really _envelop_ a dick
we don't have like socks attached to the front of our underwear where we put our dick
it doesn't "envelope" it
then are you fucking the underwear
two underwear just pushes your dick up against your body
one I have underwear on thank you very much
two points
no
like your pants??
does that mean you fuck anything you put your dick into?
just check the cardboard for how high the water went
you're
fill the pringles can with water and you're good
yea it's basically that
does this roughly fall into the "fucking a pringles can" meme
what, it's amazing
also
why did you pick this one
salina
.............
I drew it myself
here
the thing
``the thing``
i keep laughing at Gene saying Cronch i can't
the thing will not be fully submerged in the water
not where i was going with that
.........
*shave*
no then it's inaccurate because you can't submerge it all the way in without getting some extra stuff in there
no I can just lower my dick into the water
<@!503787499605458954> sorry, i found my actual twin
we're thinking on the same wavelength
<@!520095106888630348> i was already in the middle of typing that
***C R O N C H***
<@!258094439636008971> it's cronch time
so Noah we gotta cut off your dick
you fill up a beaker halfway with water and then put the object in and measure the change in volume
what's legendary is how you managed to spell legendary right
oh i know how to measure that
pfft
*legendary*
????
YOU'VE ALREADY DONE THIS IN POLL PARTY
NOAH NO
NOHA
NO
but measured in volume
dick size
now my time to present my legendary idea
ok then Gene?
y me
<@!340319804747415553> ?
who's the judge of that
^ also a good question
like do you have to bundle them together or just add the individual numbers
how would you add up girth measurements?
if someone has multiple penises do the lengths add up or do you take the average
hm
<@!520095106888630348> why stop at one?
ok well just wait until my back penis grows in a la Vicanti Mouse
yet
i'm not that much of a ho
nah
then she has to say yes
<@!520095106888630348> say it louder and with confidence
no that's why i'm asking
u sure bout that?
but you've seen noah's?
not in my good Christian Discord server
what the hell is happening
i haven't seen your dick jane
<@!340319804747415553> i call youas a witness
Idk do we know anyone that has seen both?
damn
probably bigger than yours
how big is your dick?
hmm
late-night questions
?
any new late-nights?
nvm
I am confused as well
^
i was invoked?
hi
you should not say that when your girlfriend is present
it's all transparent
also
you can view the code
so the name fits
hey i call out corruption where corruption exists
so I had to give it a name or it wouldn't let me share
I didn't think I'd need to share it until you were an ass about it
ok calling it "fuck you jane" doesn't help your case
;-; i ded
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QRPiasRT7n2t8nhWVmHMmOA_s5KIAMUERCoeEfVb33E/edit?usp=sharing
the code is the same for all them
ded squad best squad
it saved everyone he likes and killed the ones he didn't
i feel like this was rigged
shit, both salina and noah survived
9 vs 7
The new Minecraft Hunger Games
lol
should be
that everyone?
Noah
Cindy
David
Helen
Cole
Jane
Jiayi
Ken
Gene
Sasha
Salina
Alan
Jeesoo
Katya
Em
Zoe
I need a list of everyone's names
i didnt work last time

I recorded myself playing the Avengers theme on a kazoo once as a joke. That should be the theme.
Wholesome Degenerates: Endgame
I'll see ya all in the soul stone
let's decide what happens next
Nice
now we know who is alive/dead (let's go with Jane's)
<@520095106888630348> Helen and I were just talking about how we were opposites
<@!258094439636008971> i'm the reverse of you
i am dead in <@!193229269076279298> 's sim but alive in <@!520095106888630348> 's
nice
i was spared
<@193229269076279298>'s sim has me alive
<@520095106888630348>'s has me ded
<@472541429130854421> sure
<@!258094439636008971> wanna trade fates
Cole
<@193229269076279298> no
Jeesoo
dis dick
Gene
Even Thanos can't give me what I crave :(
Katya
post the photo
Noah
no go yourself and give the result
I was spared
big sad
i apparently died
Kenneth
Zoe
http://www.didthanoskill.me/
tell me your fate
F
Sasha
okay first person to die
<@!258094439636008971> also true
;D
NO
Do it, and we'll make a story
should we do hunger games simulation again
oooooh
<@520095106888630348> good idea
<@193229269076279298> I thought you said browser history for a second there
let's do a random generator
That's a happy ending <@340319804747415553>
hey I don't need a tragic backstory, have you seen my health history
if both noah and gene die i think the livelihood of this server will drastically decrease
Tragic?
i survive
i die to give him a tragic backstory
if noah survives
Why are you like this
Oof
I know it's random. Just pick people and explain what happens.
I do, you don't, my life in unaffected
Late-night question time: Thanos does the snap. Who here survives and what happens to them?
we went back to facebook for the call?
really?
one sec we're adding you
yeah
do you want to be in a call?
we are on a facebook call
you guys still doing things?
while discord always cuts out for some reason
facebook voice calls have never failed me
How is Facebook gonna be better than Discord
._.
@everyone we're moving to old Facebook Messenger group chat for calls because this quality is shit
I promised someone I'd do something with them for a bit first
I'll join you guys in a bit
fine, peer pressure
i'll hop into vc
currently I'm singing to myself in my room
i've talked with her about doing speaking stuff before
voice chat like for juts talking?
if more of you do I will join
Not tonight. I have something to do. Maybe in an hour
that's the thing
Helen really likes to be behind the scenes
do you guys want to voice chat?
You highkey hate them
That's a lie
"I lowkey hate most of you"
@ all skyline people
if you were gonna be the grad speaker what would you say
Idk how they're gonna go about filling that spot tho. I haven't heard anything about it.
idk if she'd want to tho
oooh I love her!!
She's p chill
Y E A H
what about Helen Yin?
yeah
I don't mind someone popular as long as they're not a piece of shit
revision: or someone I don't know at all
if popularity only
*level
probably someone on-leel
lmao
or someone I dislike
I feel like it'll be someone dumb
^
I swear to God it'll probably be someone who makes me uncomfort
whomst tho
we need to try our best to campaign
ooooooh
Student-voted
one is class pres, who is the other?
lol
Lmao I don't mind a meme speech, but I already expect one of the other two to be a meme speech
jeesoo or katya could be really fun
Zoe would be p good too
she'd do well i think
Idk who else is applying
i feel like zoe might apply
Tbh, Salina would be p good at it
hmmm
who else would be good for class speaker that we know
but we'll have to see
Not that I know your list
I would too
^^^
i will flip many tables
At the end of the day, as long as I can point at the podium and be like, "that's not a total piece of shit," I'm happy
if it's someone i know cheats in math
._.
and just someone who doesn't cheat
i just want them to be a competent speaker
^^^
i really hope someone i know gets it
But hey, I'll shoot my shot
And I'll probably apply, but I fully expect to get a phat rejecc
lmao okay have with that
oh lol
Kinda-ish
people with 3.9+ gpa were invited to apply
is that like valedictorian
who got the email
yeah
graduation speaker?
alex would be good yeah
oh
also i wonder if there'll be hat standards
*backs away slowly*
I really really want alex to get it to be very honest
i wonder who else is gonna apply
i'm gonna fight tooth and nail for the graduation speaker thing tho
that's a good one
That's my serious one
"Prove the pieces, prove the thesis" -William Paananen
one meme one and then put a serious one over it
yeah we should all just make two layers of decoration for grad cap
idk what to do on my cap tbh
hm
i do not go back on promises i can remember
I'll put "sure, I'm desperate" on my grad cap
I forgot about that
omg
LOL
I'M GOING TO DO THE MEME STUDENT THING
lmao
graduation cynicism achieved
SURE
?
@#$% off, not interested
she can switch in "shove off"
YOU CAN PUT IT ON YOUR GRAD CAP AND PUT ANOTHER LAYER OVER IT
"i'm not interested:"
wait there's a swearword nvm
She's gonna need to dual-wield bats at that point <@520095106888630348>
YOU SHOULD DECORATE YOUR GRAD CAP LIKE THIS
guys if you actually do this I'm literally gonna hang it on my wall forever
can we get rhinestones and shit and make it fucking beautiful
Lmao
that ok with you?
<@!258094439636008971> we're writing "fuck off not interested" on it and gifting it to cindy
L
oh damn lmao
<@472541429130854421> because that would include eliminating me
and if I was, baseball bat would be like the least efficient tool possible
I'm not planning a large-scale genocide
why are you supporting them eliminating men
you are male
Lemme know if guys need to borrow
Sure, I'm down
Oh
repelling men
I have a few
What are we using baseball bats for?
yea lol
shit that already passed
bat*
i can also do it on a baseball hat
dec 2
or just do it on the baseball bat
i can do it when's cindy's birthday
wait they have FABRIC INK PENS
on a bat?
permanent ink!
lmao i don't know how to embroider
jane, you wanna do the fonting?
that said fuck off, not interested
thank u
custom baseball bat
i was thinking of getting her a baseball bat
oh
we should make you a t-shirt
I feel like I make it p clear that I'm broadly not interested
the ones I actually flirt with know it ain't serious
I'm only like that 60% of the time
it must be your outgoing and charismatic personality
yeah that's why i said
I have mentioned I'd be willing
maybe you would make good money as a stripper
sigh
I don't do anything!!!!!!!!
wooooo
oh shit man Cindy you're popular
that's all i actually know of
yeah I'm p sure it's like 5-6 in the past year
at least 5+ at this point
an unfortunate number
or girls, if applicable
spouting off with verses about unrequited love
big facts
how many guys have you rejected
PSA: don't get a boyfriend, you leave yourself open to attack
trueeeee
she has a line of suitors
that's the way I like it honey
<@!503787499605458954> you don't have a boyfriend for us to tease you about
that's a widely applicable comment ;)
rip?
👀 👀 👀
`oh fuck this is long`
Im just a lil disappointed that he didn't comment on my comment tho
muahahahahha
oh it always is
libel and slander is all fair game
drag him
quick everyone
okie ;)
no promises
I'm going now, don't insult me too much while I'm gone
lmao interviewing yourself
maybe I should start tonight
oh fuck this is long
but interview myself
not really forge
i also have to forge an interview with myself
oh
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gZ6FkGphYnvBxOsRtibnuNtQUOzgYcwY_Q-bLr3EhJo/edit?usp=sharing
I will start tomorrow
my brains are rotting
hmu
would someone mind looking thru it
lol
you are investigating
should we open a store *here* or **here**?
basically
what did you write about lmao
what do you mean
idk if it's an "investigation"
what issues
rip
someone help
but i don't want to fix them
Car is not buried though
that's ok we don't need you anyway
my business ia has issues
boo
i think
I'm sick
me too technically
same and same
i have ia stuff still
my car is buried under 1 foot of snow
wanna get lunch or something
but
mmmh maybe
i am willing to walk
I'm down
I'm ridiculously thankful for the snow but I'm getting restless
anyone want to somehow get together tomorrow?
which is a severe downgrade
instead of noah i have 2 parents
lol sorry
oh lmao
my brain is just fucking dumb
no
oh are you guys together
WATCH THE MOVIE
wtf noah i thought you were watching a movie
*anything*
litty titty
litty
yea
i'd be down anytime after ia season is over
post-IAs
speaking of, when is that going to be revived
<@!520095106888630348> you down for rebellion
ok true we have a different one for that
your arbitrary bans are arbitrary
isn't this the situation that St. Valentine was born out of
AT LEAST WE'RE NOT DOING ALCOHOL IN THIS SERVER
I support this motion
and alcohol is a drug too
THEN LOVE IS NOW BANNED
orgy is fine and alcohol is fine but the line must be drawn at drugs
but love is a drug
no one is doing drugs here
also false
brutal
geez
obviously your partner is not `up to snuff`
ain't about that life
i'm not
nah
salina is a dominatrix
Don’t look at me
i think there's a reason that Noah's throat is sore and Salina's is not
I haven’t done anything lol
Lmao
I do/did
lmao peg him <@!340319804747415553>
you always did say I was a bottom
<@340319804747415553>'s
tea!
<@!193229269076279298> so tell us, whose dick have you been deepthroating over and over
if you think about dicks that's all you see
or just a whole lot of dick ;)
you see dicks everywhere
so I have a whole lot of dicks?
👀
they say things are what you make of it
there are dicks everywhere
👀
Glorious!
no one need take a closer look
It’s wonderful!
And everything’s a mess!
Then you take a closer look
if you look to the left it appears very organized
so all you monogamous people aren't left out either, assuming your partner is up to snuff
ANARCHY IS THE SOLUTION
Who needs organization
@david i have given up trying to corral everyone into nsfw
lol
And yes prob David
Jk
Shouldn't this be in nsfw
*laughs sadly*
Assuming the dick is big and long enough, deepthroating the same dick over and over is just as bad as deepthroating lots of different dicks
Ok I wish to clarity my point, as to not confuse anyone more
only <@!193229269076279298> would know what deepthroating too many dicks feels like
<@!193229269076279298>
honey lemon tea is a godsend for sore throats
throat is killing me
sick
Or just bc sick?
Smashed too hard?
Rip
got it
<@!261949028994908170> i would advise against trying to understand Noah
wtf
You know that feeling when you deepthroat one dick too many, that's how I feel right now
idk I assume someone could be that bad
lolllll
pretty sure you'd know if it was your dick
is that the only thing you're polishing
Now I'm worried
it's a work in progress
dw
i've been polishing my shotgun
yeah
Have you been reading
He is trying to date Noah tho
otherwise, nah
i'll shoot you for trying to date noah lol
Not cuz of this
Well, shoot me but like
i'm not mad at u
no
Don't shoot the messenger
of walking thru frozen shit every morning
Hey, man
Website is updated tho
i am so sick
i don't fucking care if you can get thru on snow tires or whatever

Rainmegeddon?

But
They said they'll update by 6
REFUSE

I
NOT WALKING TO SCHOOL IN THIS SHIT
I AM
WAIT WHAT
Only a two-hour delay tomorrow
:(
Shit
big facts

because its the one thing we do best
yes
"what you gonna do, complain"
"wake up at 7 to check"
ISD is like
damn
bEcAuSe ThAt WoUld Be ToO eAsY
Reeeeeeeeee why can't ISD be like this
Lake Washington District is more reasonable than Issaquah School District.
I can't combo your ass if the stage is literally falling beneath my feet and you're running away to a platform on the top of the stage to drop projectiles on me
Terrible
It was
r-rainbow cruise?
I raised my GSP to find matches that weren't organized by degenerates, not sit through that bullshit
However, if I fucking run into that Link player online who was playing with stage hazards on AND ENDED UP ON RAINBOW CRUISE WITH ME, I WILL END THEM
_gasp_ so scandalous
Or we can *gasp* enable items
The other Smash players too and do team battles
!!!!!
Yeah! Gladly!
can we play tomorrow tho i’m reading a book heh
Or any video game really
SMASH
<@460689096646590465> smash bros?
did Polina and Anastasia move too?
<@!105508293522264064> play in the snow with me
there is nobody left i am alone. me, my fever, and i
parinita moved
kenneth doesn’t want to hang out with me
doesn't everyone live in your neighborhood
there’s no one to play withhhhgg
play tomorrow
okay well maybe get some rest then
i will die
sneak out the window
my mom won’t let me 😦
do it anyway
i’m devastated
i want to play outside with friends but i have a fever
rip
Well, yeah, cuz running start
I don't pay
idk
Did the cost to attend change?
dorms were finished last summer
<@!472541429130854421> now they do
I have no idea
idk
BC has an app?
Or are they rolling?
Wait, when's BC's app deadline
do they have live on campus students?
I thought it was Bellevue Community College
^
I'm dumb
^
lmao
college
Wait, then what does the C stand for?
on their third round of grands I believe
legit?
0.o
they're a 4 year now
it's asleep cheaper if you go to BC
still
oh right
BC isn't community
wow that's incredible
An associate's degree is also still p valuable
Acceptance rate for transfers is like 70% at UW last I heard
it's a valid option but idk if I'd want to go the community college route though, there's other options too
oh OOF
yeah go do that helen
should i go charge my laptop and stuff
yea when I was at UW over the summer they said they have a large number of their transfer seats set aside for community college students from washington
It's a really valid option tho
or maybe not
like half the class always raises their hand to that question
yayyyyyy
wind's starting up guys
someone
*cough*
lol
<@503787499605458954> BC has a high transfer rate into UW
like there's no way I'm getting help in those situations
which is kinda why I've run through all these scenarios in my head bc it's a real possibility that I don't get into a school I can afford or that I'm unemployed immediately after graduation
But if we select certain periods out of my parents lives, I can out-earn them
i guess my challenge is trying to outearn my sister lol
he also sticks only to programming, plus didn't earn money for three years due to failed startup
I will say though I'm also very aware of the fact that if I do fuck up I'm getting 0 financial support from my parents after college
rip
My parents have made very different amounts of money at very different parts of their lives
he started working very late, at age 28
yeah I don't actually think that would be that difficult in my case
i think i could out earn my dad
Barring Great Depression v2.0
that's a different challenge
now out earning out parents
I'm v grateful for that
<@520095106888630348> plot twist: I run the McDonald's and it's that situation we talked about
yeah
we're all very fortunate in that way
^^
none of us are going to have a problem making good money as long as we don't fuck up royally
maybe I am
oops
that probably comes off as arrogant
yeah like mcdonalds <@!258094439636008971>
as much as I half-joke about being dumb (it's true in a lot of cases) I'm quite aware that I'm very smart most of the time, a fast learner, and most importantly in this discussion, willing to do basically anything to reach an end goal of success in some form
Y'all are talented enough to land jobs somewhere. I can't say where exactly, but you guys are smart, and I believe in you guys.
if worst comes to worst and I needed money, like to be totally honest I would be willing to strip or whatever
unemployment is nice when you're trying to retire
like I trust myself to have the skills and drive to make a living even if I fuck up at first? suppose I don't get into a college I can afford, I'd probably enlist in the military instead for a few years, which would be rough but I could do it and I think could be v beneficial in a lot of ways. I've seriously considered it anyways. if I don't land a job out of college, I'd either take the same path (have thought about doing the 2-year navy program in that case) or like volunteer w the peace corps or something while I keep looking etc? I see a ton of paths I could take to where I wanna go and there's so many things I want to/would be willing to do
If you know for sure you'll have a job in a few months, it can be
is unemployment ever nice tho
Contracting jobs at Microsoft make unemployment damn nice cuz they cycle you out every now and then and rehire you after your unemployment thingy runs out, but that's not generally what unemployment actually is
because I don't get it
well I suggest you work on it
idk how to explain properly
I worded that really badly
duh
most people don't see themselves being unemployed
Oh, that's not what I was thinking
that's not what I meant
<@520095106888630348> holy shit no
well sometimes it's not your choice
ok that sounds really condescending
I don't actually see myself letting myself be unemployed tbh
<@!258094439636008971> put them up for adoption
I like kids, but I could never put myself in a position where I'm responsible for one
yeah
having kids is part of losing freedom
I don't like kids but my bigger problem is the loss of freedom
both
more the despise kids than loss of freedom?
yeah really I'm p sure I'd genuinely hate myself
damn fancy
<@520095106888630348> I'll make macarons
really?
<@!503787499605458954> fair enough
the PTSA bakesale is going to forget all about your brownies
I kinda despise kids, and I think I'd just be super dissatisfied w myself if I do go down that path
<@!258094439636008971> her homemade brownies will be better than yours
Subaru doesn't make a minivan
Cindy would make a pretty terrifying soccer mom, so no
soccer mom
i'd get so fuckin bored
realistically i could never be a housewife
lol
bitches gotta do what bitches gotta do
yknow what
oh my gosh Cindy are you going to be a gold digger?
honestly
oooooh
Try the Salina and find someone who will buy you a laptop but made out of food
i'm kidding
dw
it's unnecessary
lol i thought you were gonna say something super wholesome
Rip
oof I totally have a taste for luxury in all things but I'm not like particularly wealthy rn and I feel like this is gonna be super ironic when i'm unemployed and broke in 5 years
Hence, why I'm not a huge fan of steak
I can appreciate expensive food if it's put in front of me, but I'm not gonna go out of the way for it
La Isla too tho
same
I haven't had kbbq in too long
YES
good kbbq
Gimme some of that high-end French food
sushi and caviar
tapas
EXPENSIVE food
but I'm craving like
I know
And they have a nice happy hour
La Isla is mid-range
man now I'm craving expensive food
Just on Cleveland Street, you have La Isla, Tipsy Cow, and Woodblock
Redmond has so much good food
La Isla is great
I've heard good things and I've never had puerto rican food
I do appreciate Ginza. I personally think it's pretty good at what it does.
I also really wanna go to la isla!!
^^^^^^^^
This is fucking Seattle. If you think there's only one good sushi place, you haven't gone to enough.
which isn't a big deal but it's a sign of not being the best quality
and stick to each other
it tends to fall apart super easily
their sushi is like not wrapped super well
Oh, I also really want to go to La Isla
oh it's good and the service is really good but someone I think <@!460689096646590465> claimed it was "the only good sushi in the area" and that I think is utterly false
Ginza's nice for what it is, but there's definitely better sushi in the area. My sister-in-law used to work there, so maybe I'm a little biased.
I'm just saying
though I honestly don't think ginza is that good
I feel attack
we've already gotten sushi together
If we go formal, I feel obligated to say steak even though I personally think it's overrated, but Jiayi mentioned he's never had it. My actual pick would be really good sushi.
If we're going casual-ish, I just want a fucking gyro or some pizza right about now, fam
Idk any good French places in the area off the top of my head, but I could find some if I tried
going to a formal dinner with you people would be *interesting*
French food, cuz <@520095106888630348> thinks it's just snails
Give me a second to think. I'm still in "I'm craving cheap food" mode, so I need to think.
Yeah, it's in the middle
paella isn't super casual but it ain't formal either
Hmm, are we talking casual or formal?
<@193229269076279298> also, does this mean you'll finally date me?
what would you want then
lmao
Probably cuz I don't like it to the extent Cindy does, but I do indeed enjoy it
If I were to go into Seattle to get something with you guys, it probably wouldn't be paella
I've made that clear
I don't need ideas
<@!258094439636008971> I'm impressed
noah, don't get any ideas
paella, not ass
ass eating orgy?
wanna go order some in seattle w this group
I kinda just
we have people who are at least semi competent at cooking
And no, that was not an innuendo for having an orgy even though I suggested eating ass. That's not where I was going.
also
yessss
Whatever we make will probably be ass, but at least we can eat it together
Ok, now we need to have a paella party
cooked in a giant pan w sausage, seafood, and a few veggies of your choice (usually like peas and sometimes corn)
rice soaked in beef stew
a traditional spanish rice dish
i think i've spent too much time on the rpdr subreddit
it's basically
https://www.instagram.com/p/BSuRY3EAU93jzmJMbBGzJBtb0s435YwwivThkE0/
...
iconique
`you didn't feed me`
lmao
how was i supposed to know what it was
you didn't feed me
this is it
if there was ever a legit reason for disowning u
i'm sorry mother
i am so ashamed of u
jane
That's what it is
it's the best thing ever
Heavenly
jane
OHHH man
Uh I'm blanking
what is paella?
wait what are y'alls fave foods
I don't trust my family to either
yeah i'm just kidding with u
I don't trust myself to make paella bc I think it would just make me sad
As long as you acknowledge it, you're allowed to eat mediocre food
I'm just stating my opinion
I'm not judging you
let me heathen in peace
Tru
laughs in bad paella
Im kind of a spanish food snob tho the difference between good paella and bad paella is so extreme
ngl
Paella is up there for me
i would be so down for a paella party
I have rankings
I think we still have it tho if we want to have a paella party sometime
paella is my favorite food of all time
My mom did it a couple times and then gave up cuz it was too much work
i just bastardize all of it
My family has the proper pan for it
i'm sorry i'm a fraud
i don't make the legit shit
and cry
find a recipe
I don't trust this it's so annoying to make
wait how do you cook paella for yourself
But damn if that wasn't some good French onion soup
Maybe cuz I ate a glorified appetizer for dinner last night
Although I'm craving something savory
Sounds so good right about now
mmh that's the good shit
like in ice cream
is so good
blackberry vanilla
Cuz they deserve the love
So I will
But no one calls them their favorite fruit
But no one really dislikes them
They're underrated
They're my favorite fruit
blackberries are good
Things are better
I'm eating blackberries now
you stocked the wrong food
Don't have 'em on hand
aren't there pizza chips
I want pizza, but I'm inhaling chips instead
College Student: High School Edition
well go for it
I count stressed as part of depressed here
and stressed about if Noah will kill you
and then depressed about her death
still probably be lonely because  Noah will kill her if she leaves him
true
buy Salina a laptop and you can be broke
you can do it now
why wait for college
you'll also be stressed
aw Gene don't say that
Yeah, being broke, depressed, and lonely sounds p good right about now
i want to be a college student
I really just want a sad boi college student meal right now
Paella tends to be cooked in a particular type of pan, but it's not super important
Not saying you didn't
yeah i know
Usually saffron for paella
turmeric or saffron work like that in food
i think the yellow color comes from turmuric (?) which we use a lot
when we make fried rice we add in a lot of things that don't typically go in fried rice, including sea food
Example
i don't have names for dishes
how would you like me to answer
Like?
i think some of my mom's food is in theory similar to paella
like mmh food
even the trader joes frozen stuff ain't half bad
paella is good shit
gonna feed you someday
i am like
oh my goodness
i've never had paella
Paella is so good
but like yeah maybe het the delivery people stay alive
food is good
i might cook some paella for myself tomorrow
L
I stocked up on the wrong foods
With these roads
But it's a dick move to make some guy deliver
I'm legit considering ordering pizza
lol
Only part that's missing is that they're hella expensive
It's a p decent description
and i play the violin thanks
bc i am a heathen
the best way i can describe it
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crotales
that is
they're like marimbas made of cymbals
what are crotales
He still doesn't have a full set tho, but he has like 5 of them that play an A or something lol
The dude would cease to exist
The crotales are gifts from students, and each one represents a graduating class from Skyline
It would break Pitt's heart
Oh yeah, it's bad idea
I'm in
are we planning a heist?
and there are cameras
don't give anyone ideas Gene
Stealing the crotales from the band room would be really easy, no one would know for months, and those things are fucking exspensive
i keep my stuff not out and about anymore
ooof
but anyway
and i still forget sometimes
which was an L
who does not write their name on the front of the packet
well yea but you can be like "my bad i grabbed it on accident"
i am a person
It has someone else's name on it and not in your handwriting and that person is now missing their notes
but it's harder to get caught stealing a notesheet identical to everyone else's than walking out of school with a bunch of cases of instruments
Wait, nevermind, apparently if it's of enough value, it's a felony
Stealing an instrument won't land you in jail. You'll just get fined.
<@520095106888630348> stealing notes gets you the fat plagiarism boi if you're caught
most people aren't willing to commit a serious crime that can land you in jail
I've had friends try to joking take my saxophone, but I get kinda pissy about it, so I don't bring it to school when I can afford it
well people are willing to steal someone's note packets and just annoy someone
yeah that's good
lol
I'm glad no one's taken my saxophone lol
Idk
who knows
meh
eBay
There's some pretty rare small percussion stuff in there
the tuba is useless unless you know what to do with it
also
you follow?
it's easier to make off with a note packet than it is a tuba
the other part is motivation
part of it is what's obvious
Like, your average Joe could walk into the band room and steal several hundred thousand dollars worth of instruments if they know what they're doing
I've been trying to think this through, but like I haven't seen that kind of theft at Skyline in four years
who knows
rip
<@340319804747415553> now that you brought up the bio notes thing, i'm actually a little shocked I haven't seen stuff of actual value stolen at skyline like instruments or laptops
<@503787499605458954> meesa far more powerful than palpatine
i love this
lol
alright palpatine I see u
lmao gene
<@503787499605458954> execute order 66
and if yes can I join
<@340319804747415553> I sometimes wonder what happened to some of the people in that class lmao
*gasp* are you a sith lord
I'm like the "Jar Jar Binks is a sith lord theory"
My shit's actually p decent, but I seem like my shit ain't together
I'm dumb, inconsistent, and really bitchy @ random people anyways so tbh I've never felt legitimately threatened, it's mostly people who have a rep for working hard who get fucked
yeah the class was... interesting
lol
I wouldn't put it past our last year's bio class tbh
that's so shitty and stupid what
I'm always terrified I'm gonna get something stolen at school cuz of how tired/a mess I am, but I would have never have thought someone would try to steal homework of all things
wait what?
True though
*without doing shit themselves
Damn
also how far ppl go for a grade
it was a valuable lesson in don't leave your stuff out
lol it's all good
Alright, well, glad to hear, but I'm sorry you had to put up with that
but it's all good
i have some slight salt about it
the past is past
dw bout it
yeah, it's all good
Did Willson know about this?
who knows
notebook checks?
Damn
desperation?
idk
Who steals other people's notes?
i was able to get one of them back but yeah 2 were lost to the aether
Like, plenty of people in the class would've gladly given them a pic
Fam, can't they just ask for a pic??
i love people
fun times last year
but um yeah i redid two packets
Lol
didn't happen after that
but i did one packet in reverse handwriting
Bitches
idk
Who the hell does that
yeah
poof
like
Yes
Tf?
Not like asking for pictures but stealing?
Bc she's smart and hardworking and people suck
Like stole stole??
There was a period where dumb people kept stealing her shit
last year
What??
a couple ppl like stole my note packet
no it's not you gene
Uhm, sorry
Yeah people suck
*last year*
Riperoni
cough
is STOP TAKING MY BIO NOTES
all a girl is asking
She gives great hugs
look
It's very surface level tho
<@340319804747415553> you're not. Just look at your nickname.
I think salina does the best ice queen *impression*
i'm just unapproachable but i don't think i'm that cold
I just wanted to be an edgy lad
i find it hilarious
i've been called ice queen a couple of times
You guys are being way too wholesome
No one here is particularly cold
Lmao
stay toasty, friendo
you're a marshmallow
but like no edge for you
i might not agree with your approach sometimes
you are probably one of the most supportive people i know
Let me be edgy every and then
i agree
You're one of the warmest people I know smh
I appreciate that the weather is try to immitate me by acting so cold. It's flattering.
whoa
RIP
okay
wow
Even if it stops snowing we might get the week off
I thought it was supposed to snow through Thursday
What
it won't be snowing anymore by thursday
Now I think we can actually get the week off
Which is good in my opinion
since we're def having school off tomorrow i feel even less motivated to work
My hopes and dreams are dead
My shoulder and neck are screaming out in pain again
yea i've been stuck on one page of Kissinger for awhile
The snow outside is the only thing making me not absolutely miserable
But I feel the oofs
I can only somewhat relate
Oof
i have been drowning my time in avoiding the analysis of hinduism and also how to run a v smol business
and yes much same
it's never too early
But like anyone else feeling kinda dead inside today?
So I know it's a little early for sad boi hours
For now though, get some rest. I hope things get better soon.
And if you're ever looking for an excuse to play, remember that the music get together I mentioned a while back is still always on the table
You're clearly passionate about music, and that's a virtue that will follow you and help you throughout your life
No matter which path you take from here
But know that it gets better
I'm glad to hear you're holding up well at least
Alright, well
thanks for checkin
I'm fine lol
but yeah
damn I really am in full out innuendo mode tonight aren't I
it's definitely a weight off my shoulders even though I'm super reluctant to actually pull out
on one hand I'm depressed on the other hand I'm relieved
<@503787499605458954> sorry I didn't see this until now. Everything alright?
alright well don't give it up if you love it
it's good I can figure that out on my own probably
maybe you should look for a practical application for your skills then
I could ask that friend who plays at a retirement home, if you'd like
but there's not that much point anymore and it's like. extremely expensive
yes, a lot
if so then why not?
do you like it?
idk if I should even bother continuing w lessons considering that I'm gonna stop this summer anyway
and I'm just super behind in general
lol I haven't had a lesson in like 2 weeks bc wintercon and then snow
I'm sorry
:(
I'm dropping out of competition this year for piano
I did it
well
❤
of course ❤
❤
i appreciate that
thanks you guys
let us know if we can do anything to help
much love as always
seriously though
Same over here (except for the part where Cindy's trying to flirt). You have my number if you ever need me. I have puppy pictures galore at my disposal.
haha the famous flirting
don't be afraid of waking me up, I'm probably dreaming of you anyways 😉
call me anytime
(425) 281-4452
<@!520095106888630348> hey babe, couldn't help but notice you're fucking gorgeous inside and out
It's no problem all. I'm sorry we couldn't do more to help and aren't a solve-all solution, but please let us know if there's ever anything else we can do.
also going back to the beginning
^^what gene said!!!
thank you guys.
<@520095106888630348> I know we've already said this, but remember you are never alone. There will always be someone you can go to and talk with. There will always be people who will understand if you want to be alone for a moment and mean no ill. If you feel you've made a mistake, remember it's almost certainly something that can be overlooked or forgiven. The people around you know you and will not only respect but appreciate you for who you are, no matter what happens.
she's been looking tired recently
This is more important
But for now
yea same rip
Uhm, I'll check on her a bit later
tbh I don't think she's feeling great either
i think she left
yeah
you didn't get a chance to explain lol come back
<@340319804747415553> You mean well. There's nothing to feel bad about.
^^
no it's fine
no say your piece
talk to y'all later
nvm
i'll just get out
<@503787499605458954> I understand. I came off bluntly. My bad.
i don't mean it as forcing someone to justify it
look
<@520095106888630348> If you would prefer not to say or don't know, that's valid. I just want to say that right now. We're not here to shove you out of your comfort zone.
I don't think you should need to justify opening up to others? is all I'm trying to say
I'm not, I'm listing off possible reasons
i don't mean it as an attack
<@503787499605458954> don't assume
look
just getting it off your chest
feeling a bit better
advice
support
ehh
but i think a big question is what do you want to take away from talking about it
pardon the intrusion
well
There's nothing wrong with that
i don't really know what else to say
no
it's also valid if you wanna stop talking about it
<@520095106888630348> I know we can only do so much, but is there anything you think we can do to help or anything else in particular you want to talk about? It's ok if you want to keep talking about this, but again, I don't wanna accidentally be overlooking something you wanted to talk about
<@503787499605458954> I can teach you a few tricks at a later time if you want (but that's not the focus at the moment)
I know that's something I could get better at
because as I said, you're a lot better at the emotional support side lol
I'm just specifically tryna give tangible advice
oh I've never had a negative interaction w jane either
I understand Cindy and I are kinda saying different things (which is fine, cuz like I am potentially kinda biased cuz I have almost exclusively positive interactions with you, although it's not like I'm blind to your interactions with others), but know that when we say we believe in you and that you're trying to do the right thing whenever possible, we really mean it
we're all here for you
seriously
and you're not alone
gene's much better at the whole emotional support thing than me tbh but I'm here to keep it real. I gave a few suggestions on what you can say to people when this happens and you recognize it that I think would def help
but this isn't set in stone, you are in control, you can work to try to be more careful and less hurtful
If you're ever feeling stuck with yourself as you described, again, know that you can always reach out to us
you probably do sometimes hurt people, but that's part of life. you probably don't mean it most of the time. that's life too
I can't speak for the world, but if it's any solace, I think pretty much everyone else in this server enjoys being with you, myself included.
you don't need to always be amicable around people, you have a right to withdraw and feel like you don't wanna interact with others and you also have a lot of people willing to listen and talk to you about it
i don't know
I feel like I hurt people when I'm around them but I hate being alone. I feel like I'm stuck with myself and I just wish I could get away from my own head
just something you should consider. it'll probably make you feel a lot better if you can think of and start implementing a way to improve
you don't need to have an answer right now
it sounds like you already recognize that this isn't great, so I mean, next steps. don't let it totally get you down; remember that people still like and care about you a lot. so you've at least privately acknowledged the issue. what are you gonna do to fix it?
Sometimes, the words come off wrong or your head spins and you say the wrong thing, but it's not definitive of who you are. The people who really know you will really know you. In some aspects of your life, they might even know you better than you know yourself. They will understand if something happens occasionally (or even regularly) and they will be smart enough to read your mood and see the bigger picture. In fact, they might reach out later and offer to help. But no matter what, those who see you on a regular basis know that you're a wonderful person overall. The good definitely outweighs the bad in this case.
I don't know. Those moods make me feel like I'm not fit to be around humans
And Cindy's right. When you're not in the mood to talk, it's mainly just a phrasing thing. People will respect it. Hell, I've said it to you before, and you've respected it. As long as you make it clear that you don't want to talk and it's not because of them, that's totally valid. There's no reason to feel ashamed of that.
I don't think abuse needs to be intentional, but I do think it's kind of an exaggeration in this case
There's nothing wrong with asserting what you want out of a relationship is truly believe something is wrong. I understand it can feel like it's coming off wrong if you're not in the best mood, but people would like to know if they're doing something that makes you uncomfortable or something.
If you feel it's not rational, that's ok. Again, while it may seem a bit odd for someone, it doesn't mean they don't understand who you really are.
And I definitely wouldn't call it abuse. You don't mean it in a way to harm them. If it were, they would address it directly.
well, you can be like, I'm not in the best state of mind, do you mind if I get back to you later? I'm not mad at you specifically, I'm just on edge right now
at the same time I can't be like "I don't want to talk to you" and leave because they're going to think I'm mad at them
like it doesn't really matter if i'm tired or whatever, I can't treat people like that
like "you have to do this and that to make me happy and you're not doing this right and I hate it"
Would you feel comfortable discussing that a bit? Again, I don't want to pry if that's what you don't want, but maybe we can help sort that out.
i don't know
it feels like i'm abusing people
i guess so
<@520095106888630348> Remember what Maners said about the TOK thing? Recency bias can cover up a lot of mistakes? It's sorta like that.
yeah
The consistency of them will is what I'm saying
but that's not to say that positive can't outweigh negative
ok ngl I kinda disagree with gene's "positive interactions will *always* speak many times more than a single negative one"
negative experiences always weigh heavily on people
i don't feel like that's true
Your future and past positive interactions with a person will always speak many times more than a single negative one. While you may feel it happens more than you like, remember that every time it's not happening, people are actively appreciating your presence and willing to forgive you. People are smart enough to see beyond a single event and see you for who you are, especially those who are close to you.
and again, don't forget that you are loved and valued as a person
^^^^^^^^^^^
I think it's important to note that you are actually already very conscious of it. We say and do things we regret all the time and don't want to go back to explain. As nice as it is to explain, it's realistically not possible, and no one, yourself included, should fault yourself for it. However, your behavior afterwards and your remorse is ultimately the determining factor. It separates someone who holds a grudge from someone who is is conscious of others feelings and willing to grow. You're definitely the latter, as exemplified by this conversation.
but it definitely helps if you just say it, hey I wasn't feeling great yesterday, I'm sorry for how I acted, I was tired and stressed and I hope we can move past it etc
it's hard to admit sometimes I know
I'm sorry you feel that way...
so try to be more conscious of yourself in the moment, we're all still young and working to improve ourselves. but it's forgiveable for sure, even more so if you let people know what's up
because i'll spend an hour being angry with someone and telling them why they're not doing something right and then the next day I'll be like "nvm"
I don't mean to pry, but I'm willing to try to understand the situation better.
What in particular makes you feel bad about it?
i think it happens more than people should have to deal with
unfortunately we're all just human
I admit that it happens
but like
I usually don't wanna tell people I'm ignoring them lmao
been on the tail end of that a couple of times lol
some days I flat out ignore everyone because I don't wanna deal w people
we all get it lmao
if you don't feel comfortable saying it then you can explain it after
But of course, even if you're not feeling it that day or don't feel comfortable explaining, remember that your friends and family will always be there to forgive you
not everything is because you're tired, but you probably feel shittier because you are
As Cindy said earlier, we all have our moments like that, and we'll be willing to understand others in that situation
But if it comes to the point where you feel obligated to, remember that they're human too and will probably be able to relate to that feeling
i honestly relate rip
They will still understand
oof
Then you don't have to if you're not comfortable
i hate doing that
like if someone asks if i'm angry because i'm tired i'll be like "my feelings are valid, shut up, not everything is because i'm tired"
Just remember that the people around you are willing to be around you because they want to support you through when you're having a rough one. If you're having a off-day, they will understand and even support you for it.
^
acknowledge that you're not in the best place and let people know, they'll understand
that's also valid, I'd just encourage you to tell that to people
like I've gotten mad at Cole for things that usually I don't really care about
it's a bit of a problem tho
there are times where I just can't be around people or I'm sure I'm going to snap at them for something that's not their fault
^
That's valid
not that i know of
Do you feel just kinda irritable today or like something has just been bothering you and been the root of the problem?
you're stressed and tired, it's not a reflection of who you are
we all have those moments
I was ready to scream at my brother for coming in to tell me it's dinnertime
i've been like angry with people on and off throughout the day
<@520095106888630348>
Speaking of which, I understand we got a bit off track. Is there anything we can do to help in this moment? I don't wanna be accidentally overlooking something.
We just want to do what's best for you, especially in the long run. Sometimes, you really need emotional support late at night to get you through the next week or even month.
But if you're really in need of support (or even in an emergency), never hesitate to call at any hour
<@520095106888630348> I understand, but I understand that it can be an emotional outlet to tell someone, even if they aren't reading at that moment. Idk how you feel about that, but know that option is always there.
don't be nervous about it
^^
and seriously I love late night conversations
but like i'm usually better by morning
We're still going to be there to give you the support and help you need
Even if it means not until morning
Better late than never
Then if that's a concern, message us
i don't want to wake you guys up tho
you sleep too little as is
I'm open for calls even at 25:00
I'm down
literally call me at 4 am
^^
That too
THAT
Even if we are asleep, it doesn't mean we won't read what you have to say and give you the support you need
you're worth staying up
ok fair but
or you should be asleep
false
i mean usually you're asleep
if you ever need to talk when it's 2 am and you want to die hit us up
We're always here if you need someone to listen <@520095106888630348>. Like, at any hour.
I feel like I'm not emotionally volatile anymore per se but my self-worth fluctuates massively
Is there anything we could do to help?
Agreed, you're a wonderful human being and a great friend
I def relate also rip
hey you're loved and valued
aww
it's like really problematic
I'm not depressed or anything but I'll be awake at like 2 in the morning and legit wanting to die
I'm sorry
oooof
like i'll go from being super happy and energetic and five minutes later i'll be like crying on the floor and hating myself
i'm get like so emotionally volatile when i'm tired
but yeah of course what's up?
you just did
can i say something
i'm clear taller than my brother, who's supposedly 5'11" and 3/4 (my family never lets him live it down)
i got measured at 5'10" and 3/4
got measured at like 6' a couple days before that
i think my posture is just shit
my height is a constant existential crisis
every time i check, i get drastically different shit
maybe 6'
really???
im like 5'11"ish
will you tell us how tall you are actually?
anyone else got any input? i could use 1-2 more data points. if not, it's cool tho
until i trip. then ill be shorter
also, i'd def be taller with heels ayy
you're p tall
so not by that much
he's taller than you but you're taller w heels
but i never notice the height diff
you're prob taller than me
i'm w cindy
mhmm ok thank you
gonna guess 6'1
me too
no worries
ok
idk i'm bad at judging heights of tall people
i'd guess 6'2"?
uh
6' on the dot? 6'4"?
throw an exact number
6 foot something?
if you had to guess/describe me to someone
how tall do you guys think i am
ok, so just out of curiosity
Wow, really nice work, but please try to take care of yourself!
Ok I'm going to sleep now
I fixed it
I may have stayed up later than originally intended

hey, y'all. i hope you guys are all doing well. this is just your semi-regular reminder that you all are wonderful human beings and super supportive friends. no matter where y'all are at with your lives or however tired or relaxed you guys may be, just know we're all here for each other, and i'm always here if anyone needs to talk or wants to reach out about something. i know i say this seemingly every other day, but remember i'll always be both proud and happy for y'all no matter where your lives take you. i know some of you guys have been stressed or exhausted recently, so i just wanted to remind you to find some time for yourselves here and there, remember that things will get better, and do what's best for your health.
this is mostly coming from my post-midnight headache, but ay, screw it, i'll say the things i want to say if i'm really meaning it even if i sound a little stupid doing, cuz y'all are worth it.
i guess my french hw is a minor nuisance lmao
i suppose
mmmm
that's just life
there's always something to be sad boi hours about
what do

well it depends
<@193229269076279298> are you offering to switch legs with her or are you offering to cut them off

Sasha plays a p good tenor saxophone
<@!340319804747415553> why won't you sing?
And supposedly way easier than clarinet
It's fun
If you ever find yourself with one, I can show you a few things. Also, I can recommend some teachers.
i want to learn a sax
Which, gonna be honest, I really wanna do
This might be a really awesome opportunity to learn me some more soprano sax
I think you absorb musical knowledge just by being in his presence
great we can have you do what it looks like to play the drums and then doc wenton make an electronic mix to cover it
Kevin is a god tho
"looks like"
key word
I watched Kevin in vocal jazz so I have great knowledge of what it looks like to play the drums
serious proposal, we should do karaoke sometime
If we really need percussion, we could also ask Evon
good enough lol
lol sorry
I have plenty of experience at hitting things
noah brings up that gabe plays drums
do you?
^here's when uh
*ahem*
no one here has much experience with percussion tho
What's a ratchet band
What
we can start a ratchet band
Guitar is so peaceful
yeah can we hear David play
Also, I really wanna hear David play guitar now
that's not a performance that's a bar fight
Any kind of performance is valid. Doesn't have to be musical. Bring Noah on stage, punch him, and we will cheer
karaoke*
i'm sure that's not true
we can do KAREOKE
drowning
i'm ok with the guitar
my musical talent is like my swimming

i will play clarinet
ooooh can we get a Gene-Cindy duet
^^^
oh yeah if you joined a music group as an accompanist then it'd be some good downtime and would help you make some friends in college
Np, we believe in you, but get the rest you deserve
Hell, I'll bust out my sax if y'all wanna get together and play something lol
thanks guys
if I have time in college maybe I will
But don't put music before your health
that's actually a pretty good idea
keep your skills sharp and give you a purpose
or join somewhere as an accompanist if you're up to that
i'm sure there are plenty of places that would love to have a piano player
i have a friend who plays piano at a retirement home
you could play as a volunteer
I'm sorry
like I'll still play for fun I'm sure but it'll probably end up being a slow degradation of the skills I've acquired considering that I won't be actively learning anymore
I mean, some colleges have music rooms where I don't think you have to be a music major to book. Idk tho
You've accomplished a lot up until this point. At a certain point, you have to remember that music is something that should bring you more peace than stress
and I don't want it to be a career, obviously, besides the fact that I'm not nearly good enough to do so
well, realistically, I'm gonna be broke as fuck in college lol once I'm out of the house there's no way my parents are paying for shit
Just because the ending wasn't perfect doesn't mean the ride wasn't worth it
And even if you don't intend to continue
Just because you're graduating doesn't mean you have to quit piano, but if you need the break now, you should take it
I know, it's just a really sad and anticlimactic end to a 12 year piano career yknow? like. I want to compete and it's still super important to me but I feel like even though I want to prioritize it I can't
Music is meant to enrich your life, not burden it
Your teacher will ultimately want what's best for you
^^
put yourself first
the adults in your life will understand if you explain the reasons
I can't say I fully understand the situation, but remember to do what's best for you
I'm sorry
I hate letting my teacher down, it's actually the worst feeling, but I also feel like I'm not gonna do well anyways
my parents have been pushing me to quit and I really don't want to but I also just don't have time to practice properly
I'm highkey super depressed about it but I'm thinking of just not competing for piano this year
which is actually fairly accurate but whatever
I am only situationally more put-together than he is
so if we're using that as the metaphor
well, I'm still only taller than you in heels
lol
like my height
^
wow that is an extremely low bar
you are a functional friend
therefore
2) you're not noah
1) you exist
I will say though I'm not sure if I count as a `functional friend` anyway
NOAH
oh no
why not both
i... can't tell either
both options suck
I'm not sure if you're implying "let's sext" or "let's attack cindy one on one"
lmao
wtf dude
DMs it is then
so what I'm hearing is, you do but you don't want to make everyone else uncomfortable
i like having functional friends thanks
let's not destroy everyone's sanity
nah
<@!340319804747415553> do you want to
I'll pass, thanks
should I give examples and you tell me if they're acceptable or not
please never tag me in cases of the second approach
which is most definitely not fine
and describing it and implying what you are currently using it for
which is fine
ok see there's a difference between mentioning that you have a dick
Just ignore him if he's being unhelpful or find someone to dm
unless Noah is here
Ok, but just know we're always here if you need to talk
Gene it's fine
<@!193229269076279298> you would have to pay _me_ to do you and even then i'm not sure i'd do it
Do you wanna talk about it still? Or maybe later?
I'm sorry
<@!258094439636008971>  <@!193229269076279298> has ruined the mood of sad boi hours
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4b4QoXEhtA
oh yea the price question
<@520095106888630348> everything alright?
does that make you Salina's bitch
"noah, what's your price bitch"
-Salina
also
but why
also <@!503787499605458954> I'm talking about my dick again, fuck off
as the current wielder of a dick I cannot biologically be a bitch, your point is invalid
no u
b i t c h
can you stop talking
can you read?
is it sad boi hours yet
I hope everyone in the bus is ok
That was probably caused by someone cutting off or stopping in front of a bus causing them to swerve out of control. Bus drivers don't usually fuck up. And yes it's supposed to get below freezing the next few nights so hopefully it snows then and sticks
<@373181327916269568> I think it's supposed to snow again later this week
bad drivers in bad weather
What the heck is going on here?
Yeah for about 3 hours but it never stuck
<@373181327916269568> did it end up snowing?
snow _and_ clouds
At the snow? It's making me jealous
look
<@!373181327916269568>
i've heard that beautiful surroundings make patients recover faster and need less painkillers
It makes me so happy
true
Dude, nothing goes better together than snow and evergreen trees
I looked out the window and
the sky is a rainbow
And then
Like I was staring at my phone being dead inside for two hours
whoaaaaa
Just looking outside is so beautiful
Holy shit
Ok, so idk where to put, this, so I'm just gonna say it here cuz irony
But the Earth's round, so I guess that means forever
If this is a "we" thing now, then I'm gonna have to agree, cuz that includes you guys, and I believe in you guys til the world's end
we got this
but
and lol I've never related to anything harder in my life
of course
Thank you, guys
^^^
You're right
^^
there's always room for people like that
Gene you have a lot of people who care about you and you genuinely care about other people too
I'm not sure what to say
That really means a lot to me
Thank you
Shit, you guys made that salty water come out of my eyes
it's not too late to keep moving forward
but, i do agree
`no time is too late`
it's okay to not know why things aren't okay
am i too late to say kudos
I believe in you
and that you do have control over your life, and you can and will make things turn out the way you want them to
I just wanna gently remind you that like, you don't have to always be happy or satisfied or even feel okay with yourself in the slightest
as much as I also personally struggle w this, and I'm still figuring it out too, I do genuinely have faith that things will be okay. Gene, you're whip smart and incredibly talented and hardworking, and the main thing I wanted to address is that the way you phrased it - `I'll just have to learn to be happy with my life not playing out remotely close to how I wanted it to` - just seems super fatalistic. Nothing is set in stone, no time is too late, and what you consider to be failure is still infinitely (objectively) better/a higher level of achievement than the vast majority of kids our age
BUT (you were right)
and I know it feels like you're almost not in control, or that you are but you can't figure out how to make yourself be "better"
I feel a big but coming up
ok I totally get being unable to find motivation or happiness w all the bullshit we gotta deal with rn
I will say
to that
well
Idk, man. Everyone tells me things will turn out fine, and I really appreciate that and want to believe it, but I'm wonder if things will turn out the way I want them to or if I'll just have to learn to be happy with my life not playing out remotely close to how I wanted it to.
School should just end for seniors after first semester
like the work itself is meaningless, even the numbers I'm trying to achieve to determine the course of my life are meaningless on their own
being productive on school work doesn't matter to me, p much, I get absolutely nothing out of bullshitting tok journals for example. it's a necessary stepping stone to the future and I KNOW that but I constantly fail to find the motivation to just sit my ass down and get through it all because it feels so pointless even though I know it technically isn't
i really want to believe there's a root cause to all this that i'll eventually discover and solve, but i feel like i'm gonna kinda have to accept this is kinda who i am now given i've been like this for years lol
like I just came back to staring at my EE after doing some hard campaigning for jsa shit and I physically felt the ghost of my work ethic leaving my body
yeah I think I've finally fully come to terms with the fact that I genuinely don't have a single shit to give for 98% of what we do in school
i know i have to have time for free time and like doing shit, but i just wish part of my doing shit time could be time i actually felt satisfied to use cuz im being productive on something that matters more to me
there's a problem when the only thing i can count on to reliably make me happy is finding a way to burn time and escape responsibilities
idk
relate
and im not happy in any part of that process
when im doing shit i have to do, i just want to have the time to accomplish my goals instead. when i finally have time to do that, i just want to deflate and be me
I'm always going back and forth between arrogance and overconfidence and flat-out self-loathing lmao
like
idk
it's just gotten worse every year
lol I've been like this from the beginning
I can't even say my laziness is due to senioritis
it's so incredibly unfulfilling yet so addictive
yeah, that's the wording
i feel like i accidentally broke myself somewhere along the way, but idk where or when
lol I both love and hate doing nothing
and that's totally valid
rip
i take pleasure in watching time by without doing anything important yet always wish i had more, and i don't know why i have to be like this
i know. i just thought i could be a little bit more okay than this.
it's okay to not always be okay
don't feel bad about it
we're all in the same boat
nahh
thank you
no gene it's okay
also, sorry things aren't working out great for you either. i hope things better
i kinda feel stupid doing it too lmao
sorry for speaking my crippling insecurities again
aw gene
yet i feel like i should be happy for a plethora reasons despite feeling dead on the inside
I look at myself and think idk why you bother having big aspirations
a mood
idk man. i look at myself and just think that this wasn't how i wanted to be.
idk if I'm ever gonna be a normally functioning human honestly
same but also like
but then I don't actually get important shit done
I feel like I've gotten scarily good at projecting competence even when my life is a piping hot mess
ok same
idk, i just feel like i should be doing things better with my life right now. i feel like it's indicative of my personality at this point.
just don't give up before you've gotten to bat yet ok?
it's ok
i just
im sorry
thank you
not do the things i've always wanted to do
and just like
i'll still shit away my weekends and procrastinate on everything
i'm sure you wil
it's me who doesn't change
but what if like
my brother says college is easy compared to IB
um
for the rest of our lives
but like
like we'll all still be as miserable, mildly incompetent, and doing the bare minimum as before?
things might not change?
when high school ends
does anyone ever get scared that like
this is not where i envisioned my life, but i guess this is what i have, so ok
let me get a big sip of that sad boi juice
i havent done any homework
yeah i'm kinda in that boat
i *want* to, but i don't think i can or should rip
who else here want to skip with me tomorrow
i will gladly consume that as well
leave the salt for the fries
with more salt
i needed an outlet
im still just salty over the halftime show
better than half a jar of honey
pickles are good
i think i have a problem
i've eaten half a jar of pickles today
oof
^admission officers
cuz you're worth it
otherwise, do what you have to do now and fucking sleep
or do some during lunch
if you can take the L in any of those classes, take it knowing that a snow day might save you
oh bless
but we get time in class
no TOK for tomorrow. just the essay later this week
and a bunch of jsa stuff
did we have tok?
math econ physics
what else do you have to do?
true
matheny gets it
cuz like
after sleeping
like please
do LA homework last
also
g o o d
fell asleep about 10 mins later like 2 pages into the reader
what do you have to do anyways?
yknow how I was like I have so much stuff to do
let me stay at home and be away from people for another day
p r a y
sounds pretty safe
"1 to 3 inches expected"
this degenerate is checking multiple weather platforms for insurance
in fact, he's edgy enough to bet on it
he is praying for school to be cancelled tomorrow as well
😮
this degenerate started no assignments and is dying inside
she is praying for school to be cancelled tomorrow
this degenerate started multiple assignments and completed none of them
how's life?
sure
anyone wanna be a sad boi several hours early with me?
In the organization
Why is sad boi hours its own thing now
Uh
but thank you. i appreciate that.
i dont have much choice but to use them when they're applicable
underrated or overrated, they are what they are
I kinda think your brains are criminally underrated tbh
thank you
oh I'm aware
again, im not dumb. i may not give two shits most of the time, but i'm not incapable of it.
and smart
deep
of course acknowledge them, but everything in moderation
because every change you make will center around adapting avoid pitfalls rather than building to accomplish what you want to be
i mean don't define yourself by what you see as your mistakes
for example
well, that wasn't the best word choice
I kinda wish I took band in fresh year
like I do but they're not actually that important
idk if I actually have any major regrets actually
dont hold regrets. accept where you are now and consider where to go from here.
take in the whole picture
top notch bullshitting skills at this point, but I've already covered that
it's ok to reflect, but be sure not to only focus on your negatives
in many ways
definitely more of a sinner
maybe a little softer/kinder but that's something that def still needs work
I think I've mellowed out a bit
I'm in brutally-honest self-reflection mode
im only as nice as i need to be
you're too nice lol
being a "better" person is vague. it doesnt matter what aspect of your life is better. if you're more focused or have a better understanding of direction, i would say that qualifies
idk if I'm a better person than when I started
I'd probably say finding a direction for my life I guess
im a better person than when i started
and tbh no idea
kinda already touched on this
favorite thing you've accomplished in high school
if you believe there's a problem, it just means there are steps that need to be taken. it's nothing to be ashamed about to acknowledge a fault and to try to work around it
the description is a bit extreme but honestly I fit a decent number of the symptoms so idk man
im sorry
lol I got worried and searched up the symptoms of compulsive lying again
not what I was advocating for!! but let's move on oof
it happened once
it wasnt bad enough for it to not be forgivable
therefore, i will forgive it.
were they right? no. however, it does me no good (nor does it put me in the right) to remain bitter and hold it against them
but again, they had no right to lash out at someone who was already stressed and overworked and upset
don't get me wrong
it's forgivable
just 'cause it only happens once doesn't excuse the behavior
i like my judgments but i acknowledge that my understanding is incomplete
ive literally never had anything like that happen between any interaction between me and them at any other point in time in my life
i think i've made my own stance clear
and I've already acknowledged that yeah this is biased and we don't know them personally
whatever I've made my case
I'm just saying to be careful and that you shouldn't always just take it
what a thankless word
ah forgivable
it's forgivable
im just saying
^
I'm not saying you should lmao
if i cut people out of my life because they have faults or make mistakes, i wouldnt have anyone in my life
not finishing by an arbitrary deadline that they set doesn't give them the right to put you down for it
they didn't but it's not the majority of who they are
and people's impressions of each other change over time very slowly
well, I still think they had no right to like attack you over those
a month ago, i was still doing college apps
oh oops
i literally havent seen them in a month
i just said that's what they think
again, you're right that we have super limited info
i never said they made me feel that way
sorry
but i don't
I want to believe you
I believe you, but I also think you should consider those relationships carefully considering that the first thing you mentioned "on the topic of siblings" was that they think and make you feel that you're incompetent
or badly microwaved popcorn
the repetition was there because people are slow to change opinions of others
is fire
where there's smoke
patterns of behavior say something
well the repetition is pretty fucking concerning
i don't feel you guys are in a position to make judgements about someone else based on limited second-hand info im handpicking is all im saying. whenever i'm defending them, im making a disclaimer that this is far from the majority of who they are
exceptions, not excuses
instances of being less shitty doesn't break the case
that doesn't make her any less emotionally abusive
look my mom says i'm pretty
see what cindy said
yeah, cuz im not gonna talk about the time they complimented my haircut or something
jokes aside
for them to do
and then feel compelled to backtrack and blame yourself when we say that sucks
probably an asshole
if it looks like an asshole and acts like an asshole and waddles like an asshole
I feel like you frequently bring up times when they intentionally make you feel shitty
but
ok I wouldn't go so far to accuse them of being terrible people without knowing them personally
*dabs*
see what i mean tho? they'd fit right in this friend group
welcome to knowing you're a terrible person *and doing nothing about it*
ayy
worse
which is in some ways
oh, i know that
see example: me
that makes you a self-aware ass
acknowledging you're an ass doesn't make you any less of an ass
i wouldnt defend someone i only see a few times a year if i didnt feel like it was justified
you don't have to always defend them
but you kinda sounds stockholm syndromey
if anything, it's the same flaws y'all acknowledge in me
armchair psychologist this
gene i'm gonna
in a way that seems unnecessarily harsh to me
they just acknowledge it
that's not what it sounds like
they dont blame me for it
they're dumb but it's ok bc they're 13 years younger than me of course I'm gonna think they're dumb
that's dumb
yeah but I wouldn't blame them for it
for perspective's sake
i mean, you guys would probably view a 5-year-old student struggling with a math worksheet as incompetent
and i'm totally not waiting for nail polish to dry in 56 degrees
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
remove 13 years of life experience from their lives and they're probably within this friend group tbh
uh huh
they're not that much of assholes honestly
lmao
too bad
no threesome in their future?
lmao
i think i can say for them that they will pass
maybe not the best joke to make lol
sorry
and they can go suck noah's dick bc i don't have one and i don't feel like doing it myself lol
they are, and they will openly acknowledge it
but i think your brother and SIL are assholes
and i think i've established this
life's gonna be fun cuz they're always gonna have 13 years on me
my brother and sister-in-law still think im incompetent af
so on the topics of siblings
i inferred she was
mmk
sorta
is she taking steps tho
well, the thing is she acknowledges the problem and is taking steps to work with or around it depending on the situation
but not for most cases
which granted may work for certain tasmanian devils
time will solve it
pack it up bois
look at this tumor
that's like saying
hey, man, im no psychologist
nope
maybe it'll get better in time?
im sorry
but yeah I'm a shitty person and idk how to fix that honestly
I really try to keep it real w people I know won't hurt me for it
like it just slips out
sometimes I just say something totally false for zero reason
idk
but it was like a sad laugh
yeah I totally am
she laughed and was like
no kidding
"lol same"
and she was like lol same
one time I was randomly like sometimes I worry I'm a compulsive liar
I've brought it up w my sis too
I guess it isn't surprising I turned out to be such a smooth liar
anything you say can and will be used against you lmao
I grew up bullshitting out of my ass to avoid getting my ass beat
"be open minded. your way is different from ours. therefore, you should try our way because you could be open to them. it's the right way, so you should be open to it" -parents
i learned to shut the fuck up real fast
what a fun time
my family wanted my trust and transparency without doing anything to warrant it
actions speak louder than words etc
my family has always said honesty n shit is the right thing to do while p much directly promoting the opposite
i feel like too
I feel like
my family always taught me not to blindly trust others to be kind to you
my teachers taught me to provide others with kindness
my friends taught me to help others
i guess kinda grew up believing if i was nice and helped others enough, they would eventually like me. that, fam, gets you used lmao
i just adapt to keep things pleasant
if i don't think they'll find something interesting, i just don't bring those things up
and just mirror what people want to see
that's like a direct result of my childhood I think
i just keep a low profile
for sure
which I recognize as shitty
I feel like for me keeping people not mad at me just involved a shit ton of lying
rip
i used to believe being nice would keep people happy and thus keep them not mad at me. that bit me in the ass hard.
that eventually changed
i just knew i should
I don't really know how to be nice just for the sake of being nice tbh
i just didnt understand why and how to be nice when i was younger
bc i will fucking shank your ass
me being nice has more of a bite now
i was a lot more naive with being kind when i was younger i think
honestly, that's why i originally asked if we thought our freshmen selves would be proud
yea
same, but i use my personality in a different way now if that makes any sense
I'm just a lot, like a LOT more open now
I think my personality hasn't really changed
a lot of it is me just being too tired to care tho
I've always had a bit of the don't-give-a-fuck attitude but it's a lot more genuine now I think
you don't have to attempt to quantify who you are. in reality, many small changes add up to large overall change. trying to pin it to one thing may accidentally diminish your growth
I've gained a lot of confidence
so i feel p diff
i basically revamped myself in 11th grade
that's alright
rip?
I feel both completely different and basically the same
I asked because I'm really not sure how I'd answer for myself
took longer than it should have though
i learned the difference between making others happy and being a good friend/person
i've gotten so much better at bullshitting
however
i still try to make sure i'm learning
then cool
if you can get the same result off of less effort
i stopped being as hardcore
oops
good work
that's 3
I can't tell
was that 3 n's
since beginnning of fresh year
as a person
how do you think you've changed the most
at least one or two other times before
high school you fickle bitch
hm
is it?
it's also not the first time we had that conversation
ah fun
we were doing the high school reflection thing
im still on the last one cuz i revisit it regularly
deep
but I forgot it
I had another deep conversation question ready
love u too bitch
love u
lol
and i knew that you knew that i knew
mhm
and I'm sure you knew I knew
seriously love that bitch
lmao
in all seriousness, I'm aware
in all seriousness, i'm sure
not sure i agree with that statement, but alright
;)
are you SURE you're not a sugar baby
and sometimes your bf will buy you a laptop
sounds about right
and then you die
you make the most of it
life sucks
eh
I'm sorry
I know
i'm mostly joking about myself
I think about it a lot
all good
lol sorry
but if not then it's v borderline
still not sure if that applies in my case
society threw a hurdle at you. you attempted to survive. no one can fault you for that.
yknow I'm
the pursuit of emotional abuse
lack of liberty
life
how I became such a genuinely dysfunctional human being
sometimes I wonder
it's of no obstacle to mine, and it's definitely not the only instance i have or will have to deal with it (nor is mine the first or last time you'll deal with something like it)
woo
I think I'm realistic, but maybe it's just the abundance of trust issues talkin
and i respect your guys' views
we have different views that's fine
we are
idk I feel like we're just going in circles now
classy
nice
after like 5 months in that class
l m a o
except maybe ramya failing to draw a proper supply/demand graph
i'm not in econ
i'm s o r r y
that was the saddest econ explanation I've ever seen
an acquaintance fills the society you inhabit
welcome to the friendship econ
low supply, high demand
and that's fine
but like not every acquaintance is gonna offer that
supply and demand
we just will rarely get it
but like sh, that's besides the point
everyone's always looking for deep emotional connection etc
i mean i might be
lmao
jfc we're not hermits
I think you're kinda missing the point
we're not arguing to not maintain relationships
but if emotional fulfillment and fun can make a relationship worthwhile, isn't that enough drive to attempt to foster another?
i never said you did
that' slife
you DON'T get something out of every relationship
you might just have to interact w them bc they're your coworkers or peers or smth
why we have relationships ultimately has underlying purposes
that's normal
skills, emotional fulfillment, fun, etc
and that's fine
there's people who don't matter to you
like
shrug
i mean, you described it as "usefulness"
not how
I don't
oh what
leave
then what do you get out of the relationship?
I don't actually give a fuck about 70% of the people I know
i don't trust a lot of people i know farther than i can throw them if it came down to it
and don't matter to you
but i'm saying
while also acknowledging that a lot of people suck
and cindy
see noah
you can have important useful and committed relationships
look i have good relationships with people
either you have them in your life, or you have hope that one will exist in your future
whether or not they exist isn't what we're trying to argue
not *all*
see *many*
they are r a r e
but as i established earlier
they exist
but the ones that are do exist
thank you for coming to my ted talk
many relationships aren't truly deep and committed relationships
spent the whole day sleeping off a fever
as a result
got so much shit left to do and this is helping me stay awake
can't
the common result is we take part in relationships but only devote so much to engaging with others
<@!503787499605458954> get some rest then. g'night.
whether we choose to partake in the demands of said relationships is, ultimately, a choice
if you remove the "baggage," there's no longer a point to solving the math
fuck yall I'm so sleepy
we can argue that relationships are an intrinsic part of our reality
and examine the world as a relational reality
if we wanna tok this
things i divulge are all things i am willing to discuss
i probably shouldn't have specified hollow relationships. i meant all.
i'm very rarely vulnerable with people
we're also not saying all relationships are hollow? just that many of them are
for example
what i mean by hollow is simply the fact that they are not wholly transparent and actualizing relationships
yeah same
kinda confused as to what youre trying to accomplish here
what
do you exist to feed hollow relationships because they're necessary for your physical survival or because they provide you with a sense of purpose? and if they provides you with a sense of purpose, do you feel that they're worthwhile of defining your life?
where i stop giving a damn
welcome to cynical hour
we just like our niceties to pretend they're not
and they often are
relationships can be hollow
just in prettier terms
that's what i mean
kinda the same thing
im not looking at use so much as whether or not they enrich your life in some way
but to each their own
i would strongly disagree with that
doesn't mean they're useful people
they way i've been conditioned to deal with shit is equally fucked up, just in other ways that appear more socially acceptable.
just because there are people
hey me too
and i acknowledge that the way i've been drilled to deal with everything is pretty fucked
depends on your definition of function I suppose
for the most part anyways
but ultimately I do agree w salina that it's important to be independent enough to function without them
i'm just the walking poster child for r/raisedbynarcissists at this point
they're important parts of my life
I care about other people
i don't believe i'm 'alone'
I'm not alone
and different people live by different worldviews
oh you're not *alone*
i understand there's a lot of nuance to it and that's a brief oversimplification
this is just my worldview, and i understand it's not everyone's, and i respect if you guys wanna disagree, but there's not much worth trudging life through if you believe you are truly alone. you either believe that there are currently people by your side, even if that doesn't manifest itself as support, or that there will eventually be people in the future. i'm not sure i am where i am today (or here at all) if i didn't believe there were other people, but part of believing in that is searching for and finding signs of life. otherwise, the people around you may as well be as inanimate as a door or a desk, and the world population would be stuck at one, and you'd be miserable for nothing.
I often I'm a v cautious optimist but I'm also super fucking pessimistic about the world in general in a lot of ways
idk what I consider myself at this point
but few things are truly good
like i do think i'm an optimist
it's okay to be hopeful
i just think it's very important to be realistic
not the first time i've seen it tbh
woo?
the salina zhang school of how to be nice without being a doormat: for the cynical but kind-hearted
and i'm sorry to say that
i understand that
sorry is useless
im sorry to hear
literally from the song I'm listening to rn
random lol but
so if you need a hero
just look in the mirror
no one's gonna save you now
so you better save yourself
and everybody's hurtin
everybody's goin through it
but you just can't give up now
'cause you gotta save yourself
i've been walking on one leg for damn long
if we want to follow that metaphor
i would disagree
you're right. a crutch doesn't walk for you, but you're sure as hell not walking with only one functional leg
it's not helping
if the recipient doesn't want to accept it
even if you offer the best help in the world
i've said this a lot in TOK
but that's never really helped
there's nothing wrong with needing a little bit of help
i've been offered help so many times
i've self-destructed so many times
but you have to be independent enough to keep yourself fighting
self-centered? yes
callous? yes
i've had to acknowledge the fact that people can try to help but you have to save yourself at the end of the day
at this point
that's all i really have to say
yeah but you don't only interact w the good people
a good ~~man~~ person is hard to find
they'll help you out of holes that nothing else can save you from
I have major trust issues also but honestly more just from how I've been raised and less from trying-to-nice-and-getting-burned
you eventually find the good people
but there are a LOT of fucking disadvantages
yes there are some benefits
i've got trust issues out the wahoo
gene, you're too wholesome for this world
other side of the coin
so
and i've been used because of it
i've been a damn good person
but my experience is just one out of several billion, so what do i know
i like to think i've been a pretty decent person throughout high school. granted, i had my lapses and failures to do so, but there were definitely benefits along the way, even if they weren't the one someone would traditionally seek
but i'm aware that it's not sunshine and rainbows out the ass
i still like to play by the rules
it's a bit that stuck with me
but I get your point lmao
eh
bit dramatic
"Rhaegar fought nobly. Rhaegar fought bravely. And Rhaegar *died*."
i would like to quote GoT here
you pose yourself in a disadvantage
yeah
kiiiiiinda disagree
i would say it does
it doesnt inherently hurt you either tho
patting yourself on the back and giving yourself kudos gets you nothing
no, it doesnt
doing good doesn't inherently benefit you
manipulating others is just child's play to some
although i disagree with the part about nice people always getting the short end of the stick
cheating is just the fucking beginning
because it already isn't
what if it doesn't get caught
but what if
we can hope that we can catch wrongdoing and that life will catch up to those people
it tries to
that's just the truth of it
society doesn't work itself out
nice people always get the short end of the stick
yeah rip
but i know it's bitten me in the ass
i try to be the best person i can be
not the same thing at all
I try to be successful
I don't try to be the best person I can be
but okay
i disagree with the last part
we just all try to be the best people we can be for each other, and society all just works itself out
then again, not many people see mine, so i guess it evens out
to be fair, i havent seen all of you at your worst
i'm feeling cynical
and sorry that's pessimistic
we alll think we;re good at shit until we've been dumped into the deep end
yeah probably not
though idk if gene has seen that side really
uh, well, i probably dont provide academic or materialistic value to you then, cuz i've never been manipulated by you then, and im p good at spotting it lmao
and I said it myself anyways
u right
it's good
nah
and i'm sorry that's blunt but i don't feel like sugarcoating
it's one thing to comfort, it's another thing to ignore a truth
sh
that's a lie
gene
you're not at all manipulative
like I really worry about becoming like that tbh
i never really got to know her tbh
but I can't get over how manipulative she is
she's whip-smart, extremely socially adept, and can be genuinely really funny
i remember the gilded age projects last year were an L  for me because everyone but jiayi and one other person kinda ditched the project, but we got a good grade, so it's not really comparable
rip
it's a weird relationship
I oscillate between respecting and wanting to like sarah and fuckin hating her guts
never a g a i n
like i love steph and jiani but good lord
my teammates' procrastination bit me in the ass
and it pissed me off because i'd set up the IA pretty well
r
basically hl math is a pit of despait
that's what dropped me under the line
yeah
im so sorry
idk what happened with your math ia projects, but those sound like super Ls, and i have no idea what to say tbh
r i p
honestly I'm more salty @ sarah about the fuckin math ia than literally anything she's done to me in jsa, which is a lot
both of them
that's really frustrating
i'm sorry
ooof gene
i mean 1:30 in the morning
gene I'm sorry 😦
and by earlier
oof
and then the notation was w r o n g
im gonna have to go with the time the person i thought was my best friend ghosted me then violently cut me out of their (understandably so tho)
close runner up was realizing how little the band program (more specifically pitt) valued my contributions and what i was trying to offer and just never acknowledging my presence outside of being a walking joke
i went to sleep earlier than the rest of my group bc they promised to finish
oh dude i'm bitter about the group math ia too
never said thank you
oh big oof
i would say the beginning of junior year ngl
they just let me do all the work
YOU DONT UNDERSTAND my group and i were skyping until 4am
I'm still really fucking bitter @ my useless group members for it tbh
WAIT ME
pulling an all-nighter for the math ia presentation last year
oh other one is also math-related
it’s okay i felt the same
: (
and I'd been consistently raising it every semester for 3 years
my lowest low huh
gpa was something I'd always been kinda insecure about
aw ripppp :(
awww im sorry...
i feel so bad that we didn't manage to get ow for you <@!503787499605458954>
def cried over that
getting a really shitty math grade 2nd sem last year
college app process is up there gonna put that out there
in high school
hmm
so sad boi hours theme
lowest low (that you feel comfortable sharing)?
again, i have my switch set up on the projector in my house now
we should all get together and do it sometime
<@!340319804747415553> and I used to game together every friday after jsa and it was glorious and I miss it
*cuz it was fucking amazing holy shit*
good
no
is it shallow to say getting my switch was one of my best moments in my high school years?
but it was genuinely one of the best times of my life
that's impressive
daaang nice
I'm the pnw director of summer school lmao
sorry
is bleeding into this convo
ok my job
that's lit
damn
there's also a diplomat program in beijing
woooaaah
o shit band disney trip v3.0 was a highlight too
and stanford, princeton, ucla, uc davis
yeah!! at georgetown
that's cool
that's a thing
woah what?
nyc both times
jsa summer school
if we're counting summers
uh
oh
oh I wasn't counting summers
i thought my life was getting good there for a sec
oh, also, summer after freshman year
let me play sad violin in peace
nah, it was the football team having way too much money and doing things with it
scrub
you weren't in band
looool
why the hell wasn't i invited
and my first reaction was
i read that as "taco dome trips"
aww that's sweet
also freshman band tacoma dome trips
but noah
this is sappy too
wintercon soph year was def my fave tbh
we love you too
awwww <3
aw
hate to sound sappy but honestly meeting you guys and hanging with y'all regularly
1st winter congress
dude yes
1st time qualifying for icdc
favorite things that have happened to you in high school?
ah
on my part
subliminal?
*subliminal salt*
and admitted it after
he was just jealous and bitter
what did i do
beyond me telling you to get your school shit together
like c'mon
oh dude I was fuckin livid
i got so angry after he tried to drag my ass
no major regrets
that's a number
jfc
we had some good times though
lmfao
2.8 whaddup cindy
ohhh boi
i got actively cut out of someone else's life, but that's a sad boi hour for another sad boi hours
but looking back he was kinda a bitch the whole time so
the only real downside to soph year looking back was actively cutting a friend out of my life for the first time
fresh and soph was when band was actually fun lmao
is so inconsequential now
and I feel like everything I worried about then
so i kinda wanna say freshman year cuz it was a big  o o f  , but i now know that nothing bad happens and it's just kinda lonely
like I don't remember too much of it
fresh year was just a derp for me
p
i
r
freshman year was isolation city and big scare
sophomore i had big stress and got one of my besties to kinda hate me
junior year felt like being a fish out of water and just trying to survive
this year i found where i was socially comfortable but destroyed my mental and physical health
just kinda hang
this year is when i've let it all
junior year was just a growth year
ain’t that life tho
soph was cool but the end of it was like a fucking L
but also really low lows
junior and senior year have both had really high highs
freshman year... eh
i have trouble picking a clean cut year cuz the Ls are super scattered
i coasted through finals
sophomore year was the year i burnt out, had to drop some extracurricular, almost failed math, and saw a counselor every month before i could get back on my feet
but also a lot less stressed
damn, really?
pre laptop
:/
me a month ago
was prob my happiest year
freshman year
easily
soph
if you guys had to pick one year of high school year to relive moment for moment, what would you pick?
shoutout to jane, except i dont wanna ping her cuz she's probably asleep
shoutout to <@!340319804747415553>  and <@!472541429130854421>  especially for sticking w my ass
mine changed way more than i expected them to
my friends haven't changed that much over the years tbh
freshman gene would upset me for running his social life through the shredder and making papier-mache out of it lol
but I think she'd be glad I found a Thing
lol rip
I can't remember smol cindy ever thinking about international politics
i feel like freshman me would've understood why i wanted to game dev if i took the time to explain the interest
pre-jsa I had zero (0) interest in politics
one botany course and then i was a goner
i really wasn't a people person when i was younger but i did want to do bio since like 4th grade
i think mini me would have been surprised but also not *that* surprised that i want to be a doctor
tbh
and the fact that i'm as close of friends with most of the band people i got through middle school with
rip
rip
they'd be mostly shook by the fact that the mariners still havent made the playoffs since  2001
mini me would be shook @ what I wanna do w my life
lol
yeah, i guess
beginning of freshman year?
are we talking like
lol rip
they'd be shooketh over how my friend groups have shifted tho
young me would laugh nervously at the fact that i'm still single and just be like "o fuck we screwed" and i'll be like "nah, fam, this is the life. you just don't know it yet"
freshman gene would be surprised about how much of his life i had to tear to to give him what he wanted tho
and um this is sappy but young me would be flabbergasted by the fact i'm super happy in a relationship
i've done well in school and done my dabbling in clubs and extracurriculars
i think they'd just be proud i had friends
i think i've gotten a chance to experience most things for myself
but at the same time
my freshman self would say "that's a price i'm willing to pay"
wtf happened to your drive
i think freshman me would be like
disappointed at how little I still have my shit together
and shooketh at how much I've matured
I think she'd be proud of what I've accomplished
^
valid
both
you guys think our freshmen selves would be proud or disappointed in us?
these days
i'm frazzled as hell and my skin is mad at me again
having a really hard time motivating myself to do  a n y t h i n g
I'm just
in the same boat
mood
im sorry
the senioritis is so fucking real
ayyy
lol same!
im just not feeling super great about myself in general. it happens.
i wouldnt mind
do you wanna chat or nah
rip
the moodiest of swings
just a minor sad boi hours is all
you ok?
<@!258094439636008971> ok, fine then
<@!258094439636008971> let's not talk right now.
<@!258094439636008971> oh, hello. it's you again
thanks!!!
good luck ❤
I feel
so
ingesting a ton of sugar at 3 am is def not healthy even if it's fruit
and I was just like I don't think you get how bad it got lmao
I told my sis about my old habits a while ago and she was like I don't see the big deal
i probably don't say thanks often enough, but i really appreciate it
lol. yea a lot of people don't take it seriously either
oh yeah definitely 
but i am very grateful to know that i'm not the only one who has struggled with this
but I'd be careful w that 'cause it could become unhealthy p easily
another thing that helped me at the time was tracking my meals
I def also still stress eat, just at a much less frequent rate than I used to
let us know if we can help in any other way
of course
anyway thanks for listening to my rant 
I'm working on it, as always
you guys are all really great
rip
though i guess a decent number of people eat to their deaths
In the future they could be the same
but that's a different problem
well you could die
well unless you're dead
yeah it's really never too late
there is no better time than the present to start
i think it has overall gotten better since probably a year ago
anyway none of this is a new development
i know i've been trying for two years
easier said than done
there's probably a better way to go about this, like become a more productive individual so i am less stressed
oof
wait for the next two weeks to be over
what might help you reduce stress?
when i wasn't stressed (for whatever reason) in the summer and had no temptations i never thought about binging
in the end it's mostly about mindset
tried that; it sometimes works but didn't replace food to me
also I'm p sure you already do this but keeping water but not food next to you
gum might help
yeah that's what got me into the habit of snacking two years ago
I keep any/all food away from where I work
didn't happen of course
so what if you chewed gum? It keeps your mouth busy so you can't eat anything else
once my stomach was so full i seriously thought it could burst and i would have to go to the er
nope not at all
but it's not the hunger that's the problem right?
like it's just food, it's just a part of your daily routine and not something to get excited about
<@520095106888630348> Gum tends to create hunger since it makes you salivatate I think
i read that the key is to think of food neutrally
at this point all there's left to do is try to change how i think of food
I've always joked my mom does keep food in the house, she keeps ingredients, but it does stop you from having the ability to get unhealthy snacks
can you try chewing gum?
already did
are you sure, can you not just get rid of all the snacks in the house?
but i keep getting more creative with finding stuff to eat, and i won't be able to eliminate everything tempting forever, so that's not the solution
i already threw out all the sweets and snacks i binged on since last winter
for the month of august i was basically completely fine
what types of food do you keep in your house?
or plain bread
or a jar of honey
sometimes i just get the general idea that i want to eat and then go fish around for snacks
most directly it's when i think of something i want to eat and then find it
and is there a specific kind of food you tend towards
generally is it a result of cravings?
a lot of people stress eat sometimes but i find that it happens to me almost everyday
but i find that when i'm stressed and don't want to do work or i'm bored a suddenly crave a lot of food lol
sometimes i can resist eating a bunch of extra food and just sticking to 4 meals a day
is it usually like snacks or just whatever's around
A nutritionist would help you draw out a plan and discuss strategies and help you when things go wrong I think
okay
so, not 24/7 then
i already do that
even starting from like 12/12 is helpful imo
i have all the tools i need
i won't like hear their magic words and suddenly get better
nothing a professional can say can fix the problem
it's a lot harder to physically fit that much into your body
well, if you shorten the time frame like
<@472541429130854421> Have you considered seeing a professional? Just curious. I'm not here to push you into it, but if eating thing is particularly problematic, it might help.
my main problem is like eating 3000 calories a day and i don't think condensing it in a certain time period will help
water and black coffee in between
I don't eat till lunch and don't eat more after dinner
yeah
do you currently do it?
and it was a lot easier than I thought it would be
I just do 16/8
and it's nothing extreme
it is helpful but hard to get into the habit of
idk I just find it helpful to not eat at all/limiting my intake to certain time frames bc sometimes, esp when I'm stressed, I start eating and have a hard time making myself stop
the problem is actually following the plan or whatever
i know basically everything i need to fix this and then some
I can't say I know much on the subject either
search it up
it's actually really good for you
Yeah
i don't think that's healthy either
oof
except my mom doesn't want me to do it
i have no problems intermittent fasting
I don't talk about it much and this may not work for you but something that's really helped me is that I now follow intermittent fasting
sure, a lot of times it was just like fruit, but it definitely was not good for me
I got into the habit of eating a shit ton at like 2 am
for one
I don't think it was quite as bad but like
i think it's just a case of stress eating but a bit more extreme
I used to do almost the same thing
to be very real for a sec
I get what you mean tho
ok that's an exaggeration
24/7
What about situations?
And Cindy's question is important too
not a specific food; sometimes i was just in the mood to eat a lot and would eat whatever was available, including really bland foods
Have you considered seeing a professional about it? It sounds like something that concerns you.
is there a specific trigger?
i started binge eating a lot in october 2017. I've wanted to lose weight since the summer before that. That wasn't the reason I started binge eating, but stress made it worse obviously
1. Is it the schoolwork itself or the readjustment that's been stressing you out?
2. Would you be comfortable providing some more detail about the food thing?

I'm sorry. I can't imagine what it's like. It sounds really frustrating
my mom was willing to help me but to an extent and i get it because it's my own responsibility and i'll be living alone in less than a year when i'll have to manage everything by myself
I definitely feel that tbh
awww
there's nothing new for me to try; i just have to change my mindset and basically rewire my brain
more specifically, i've had pretty unhealthy relationship with food and i've been meaning to fix it for over a year but it hasn't gotten better
i guess most broadly-speaking, ever since college apps was over the focus has narrowed back onto schoolwork and things i used to stress about
Anything bothering you is worth saying if you think it needs to be said
Or at least nothing new or urgent
Yeah I'm fine
I'm thinking of things to say
you ok?
Do you wanna talk about it?
:') thanks guys
We're here for you ever hour of the day
yeah what's up
Every hour is sad boi hours
Is it sad boi hours yet
im proud of you guys too
get that W
woo
proud of u
rode that curve hard to a W
i think vb put in grades
how'd bio final go for you btw
w o o
rip in peace
well, then if i'm pissing away my life tho, at least i get to do together it with y'all lmao
not done work all weekend
i have like
yup

and we just look back and like
"wow, we really pissed away our entire lives"
well, everyone does
i feel like i do this every day
mood
wow, i really pissed away my entire day today
What happened emi D:
Whether the shovel can physically arrive at your location is another question

The saddest of sad boi hours
It's always sad boihours
Hilo
So hi
I haven't talked in this channel yet
so back to sleep for you
you said you were getting up early tomorrow
hmph lol
b i t c h
go back to sleep, bitch
I have been awakened
spoke too soon
besides, noah isn't up so i'm actually paying attention to my work for once lmao
dw bout me
nah i'm doing some light studying
just bring vaporeon tomorrow and we gucci lol
yeah, dont let me keep you up
no homework tomorrow, so i guess i can take a fat nap tomorrow until eycb rehearsal
i won't be here for as long, but i'm here for moral support
thank cindy and that sounds like a good idea, salina
i usually watch a video every 30ish mins
if you do need to talk later i will be up for a whiiiile
thank you
of course
good luck!!
don't be afraid to take a break though
thank you
im gonna get off of discord for 5 minutes at the least to calm myself down
you've got this!
good luck :)
alright thank you.
mhm
like that?
i gonna go find a way to regulate my breathing in the next five minutes and then finish journal 27. then ill do journal 22 (the movie questions) and put everything together by 12. by 1, i will have done my one pagers. by 1:30, my labs. by 2:00, ill have done the data collection and sleep
it's just works for me
i could see it not working as a solution
idk
like get yourself to do something small and keep going from there
i suppose
one step at a time
figure out your pacing and break things down
what works for me is just small steps
but anyway
i don't deal with stress so i'm gonna like... not talk bout that
i know the feeling of being unable to do what you should be able to do
it's weird 'cause I'm normally an asshole but I guess the Canadian comes out
lol
I sometimes apologize to furniture when I run into it
that aside
oof, this sounds like me
but anyhow
i think i said sorry to the whiteboard at one point
i annoyed reinsch with how much i said sorry
people give me shit for it all the time
eh i apologize to everything
that being said, advice never hurts
we can't account for every factor that affects you
that's very true
i also apologized to a literal potato earlier today
but we can try to help.... however, at the end of the day, we're not in your head
the window is fine. i feel bad
and oof window
im sorry im just rambling
how you deal with the feeling really depends on you
oooooof
i threw myself at a window really hard when i was trying to do my USC app before the deadline cuz i couldnt think straight cuz of all the stress
to be really honest
but anyway
lol i know
I was kidding
i've gotten this feeling too much recently, and idk what to do
`to not end up like me? lol
` also cindy - no... i keep my shit together so i can help others
like my life will be falling apart and I feel nothing
rip
just a different and more wholesome one
but yeah
you are
just being a meme
not the situation
<@!503787499605458954> i envy that
Oof
but idk if it's a panic attack or just stress or what
It’s tough I know
like i know i can do stuff if i did stuff
I'm literally the embodiment of that meme where the dog sits in the middle of a flaming room and says "this is fine"
i don't know why this keeps happening to me, but it prevents me from focusing
I do understand it though
I’m sorry but I haven’t
but I'm sorry
tbh, not really
cuz like
to not end up like me? lol
do you guys know that feeling where you're super stressed, everything is technically manageable, and things aren't too too terrible, but there's this sickening feeling inside your chest and stomach, and you head gets light, and you feel like you wanna cry?
Also it motivates me to keep my shit together
This has been my gig since like 6th grade lol
thank you so much for being so supportive
you're an angel
i'll do my best :)
lmk if you guys need anything
anyhow
w o o ?
so lazy works for you
but you're also efficient
i am very lazy
idk either
idek
what is a healthy work-life balance
what is organization
what is motivation
i want my shit to put itself together
for real lmao
i love having my shit together more than most
np :)
thanks ❤
oof rip gene
alright
huh
you could try to reformat it from this article
<@!503787499605458954>  https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/science/factfulness-how-well-do-you-know-the-world
idk how to feel right now
at the same time, i really needed a break. i hadn't an actual moment to rest since october
i guess it wasn't wise spending all weekend playing smash, so i brought this upon myself
aaaaand she's pissed
There’s the test yourself doc
thanks nyt
lmao what the fuck
awwww
my mom walked into my room and was like "yay, now you can sleep" and i panicked, and i think she's super disappointed in me now
I love u

19 url is
what's the long thing from 19?
kind of an L
and the long thing from #19
<@!340319804747415553> how long do the labs take?
so i can send you a pic
i can see if i have it
could you describe it a bit more?
?
it's the pink test yourself thing
L
I just realized I'm missing 2 of the big article thingies
same on tok journals
there's not many labs
i'm more worried about the labs and digging through my backpack to find out which ones i have
all of them but enzymes, cuz i dont think i understand jackshit about enzymes
are you gonna finesse them correctly
yeah?
do the labs take long?
okay serious question
they're each about 15 minutes if i finesse them correctly tho
you dug yourself quite a snug hole to lie in
ngl
tbh rn you have to fucking speed up the process
but
mhm
i mean, i think i should be able to do them tho, since i learned the stuff, right?
if you want pics of onepagers, lmk which ones you need
i feel like that's not a good sign
oooooof
several one pagers (4-5 of them?), a couple labs, and my ia data collection (i have all the stuff, i just need to put stuff on the doc)
what do you need for bio
take a deep breath
so im extra fucked
it's my bio notebook and tok journal
it's not even studying tho
i didn't lmao
i should've studied
same over here
mood
me, except I don't even know what I wasted that time on
i should be doing a big asleep
i still have things to do
why did i spend 23 hours playing smash bros
i’m just Tired of life
it’s really fine
If you're doing something not directly because you want to do the thing itself but because of frustration at something else there is usually a way to redirect frustration
Again, I'd just encourage you to try to think long term
One question is do you want to risk it becoming a habit
Well, there probably is something to be gained from it if you feel compelled to do it
That's not the only thing I'd worry about
Just because it's not like threatening doesn't necessarily mean it's not harmful or there's something to be gained from it
it’s not life threatening
At the same time, as someone who does something she later regrets very frequently, I think theoretically it is good to be impulsive once in a while and regretting it later is life experience. But depending on what it is you want to do you might want to do it again if you do it once.
Like if it's just the mindset you're currently in/how you're feeling in the moment, that's valid, but maybe not a great place to be in to make decisions affecting the long-term
Yeah basically what Helens saying
I guess my only real advice would be, consider if you would still feel like this is necessary later on
That's a good point
If it's something you think you're going to regret later, maybe try to delay doing it for a while. You might think differently later
there’s not much anyone can do about it lmao this is just the way things are
Is there anything we could do to help?
idk man
do you feel like you will always need to do this? like if you don't do it today you'll want to in the future?
i’m really out here saying fuck it to all my values
I understand you said no one will die, but no one should get hurt either, be it physically, mentally, or emotionally.
Whatever decision you choose to make, please don't make a decision with the sole purpose of hurting yourself. You don't need to make a mistake if that's what you're actively looking for.
just make sure it's what you genuinely want to do
but I do get the feeling and hello resident expert on bad decisions here
I mean I'd be lying if I said I wasn't concerned rn
and do you think it will really break their trust, or just make them unhappy with you for a while
do you think losing your parents' pride/respect is the worst long-term effect of whatever you're planning to do?
I just want to say that no matter what you do or what happens to you, you're always our friend first, and we're here to support you through anything and everything
i know
I'm not necessarily saying you shouldn't do it
again, valid
Emily, I just want to say I'm here for you too
i feel like i need to make a mistake
cindy i’ve never made a truly bad decision in my life
does that make sense
for once i just want to deal with the consequences after they happen not before
it is
is that important to you
nobody and nothing will die if i go through with this except for my parents pride in me
I of all people am not gonna judge you
and that's valid
that’s what i’m feeling right now
of course
have you ever felt so suffocated by everything from expectations to how people perceive you to how to what you expect of yourself to what society wants to label you as that you just wanted to act impulsively
but like are you sure you want to do whatever it is
you know that’s good advice and usually my train of thought
it's your life, your choices
not trying to be patronizing
if you're sure you're gonna regret it, maybe reconsider?
when i’m made of regret
maybe afterwards
do you wanna talk about it?
ooof
i am about to do something incredibly impulsive, irresponsible, and disrespectful to my parents and i don’t know why and i am full of contradicting emotions but the conclusion is that for once i am actually wrong and my mother is right. my parents are doing their best and they don’t deserve this so i guess i’ll just go to hell
but yeah we're all here for you if you ever need to talk
emi we love and support you and that really sucks
Idk how long your break is, so if you're busy and need someone to talk to later, please don't hesitate to talk to us. We all wish you the best and want to help you in whatever way we can through this. You're a wonderful friend and deserve however much support you need.
Alright
A lot of this sounds out of your control for now, but I at least hope you're holding up ok (and if you're not we're of course here to help cheer you up)
yeah i’m at work rn on my break
Are you yourself doing ok at the moment?
❤
No, it's what I'm here for. Don't worry about it
it’s okay thanks for listening
anyway yeah i mean i think everything will be okay
Oh, I see. I'm sorry about that. I can see how that would create some messy tension
so like ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ it’s complicated
we just don’t really talk about it my mom just said that she’s not chill w my cousin/aunt’s mom bc “she married her dad for his money”
idk much about her family money bc that’s the Drama w her mom marrying my mom’s dad
I hope she's ok...
Yikes, does she have anything to fall back on?
and like my cousin/aunt who is my age really wants to go to college next year and she relies on her dad/my grandpa for financial reasons so idk how it’s going to work for her
I'm so sorry
That’s rough
Oh my gosh, that's must be really tough for her then. I'm sorry. Again, I can't really imagine what she must be going through right now, but I hope things get better
Damn
i don’t really know my grandpa that well bc my mom really stopped talking about her dad after he married her stepmom bc Drama
it’s okay i’m fine since i’m not that close to him. i just feel so bad for my mom bc my mom lost her mom when she was like 13 from diabetes so she only has her dad
Is it possible to give him a call? I can't imagine how hard this is for you
oh my gosh, I'm so sorry
kinda Real Sad stuff but my grandpa from my mom’s side has liver cancer. i kind of already knew this bc my aunt (my mom’s sister) called last night and told my mom and my mom told my grandma over dinner. my other aunt (my mom’s half sister who i call my cousin since she’s my age) texted my gc w me and all my cousins that we should visit him and i really want to. my mom is visiting him right now but i can’t go bc of family beef with my mom’s side of the family and it’s kind of frustrating
nice!
woooo!
bc dear lord
i only need a 70% post ib score bump
i am so glad
bc i fucking at the ib problem math markscheme
why do none of us ever sleep lol
solid brother and bro
that he is
he's an interesting one
Gabe is great
gabe's a character
gabe's in my french class lol
lol
Gabe tried to invoke bros before hoes on working chest with him
i looked up "sugaring" and apparently it's a hair removal technique
rip
what if you're just bros w hoes
that's what sugaring is for most part?
yea Japan has that
is there a way to pay someone like a hooker but like without the sex? just to like be friends for a day and whatnot
hoes before bros
be a client or just stay silent
shhhh 😉
that's called being a client
that's not being a bro anymore
do you even lift bro
didn't you hire him as a hooker
<@!193229269076279298> like mmeeeeeeee?
bros but in the best way
saint nicholas and the crew yeah noah we know
(who was also significantly better than him but that's just tea)
have you seen who I go with
lmao
the broiest of bro friends
he was there with like
well tell me next time
p much
on occasion
still living the math frat life?
I'm not qualified to teach and classes are fuckin expensive
wait you go to sbp?
how's he doing?
drag people to stone gardens with you
oh seattle bouldering project
we've been back at school for a hot minute now
damn
or 3
like 2 weeks ago
sbp?
but I ran into jackson zariski at SBP
oh random
p
tbh I really wanna go back to stone gardens but I don't have a climbing partner anymore so that's a ri
ok
oh it's recent
tuesday was just a weird situation
y e s w e w e r e
true
which is a hell of a lot better than before
were you not at the Y
look i'm exercising
wait your parents ok'd it even after them finding out when we were supposed to be at the Y?
valid
which i have been... mostly
my parents just want to make sure i can commit to working out regularly
oh nice
i will get membership after this month
lmao that is not what she told me but makes sense
i've been living off of noah's membership
she's my guest
oh what
na she doesn't have membership either
<@!340319804747415553> 👀
find a friend that goes to the Y and join them
this will probably not start to happen until summer at earliest
I am broke, have no time, and have unsupportive parents
lift all the weight
lift then
lol rip
it's unfair
also I realized kids are really fuckin strong for their size
idk how to describe it either but like aside from losing skill, everything feels different
rip
like skating now I can feel how different my center of balance is n stuff?? all my proportions are different? I'm a larger person with a significantly worse muscle to overall mass ratio?
idk how to describe it
but it's not like not losing a sense of movement for me
it's weird
yeah i've noticed the way i move is kinda different from normal people too
rip
mmm. not really what I meant, more that after growing into essentially an entirely new body I kinda lost sense of movement and am still relearning how to use said body effectively
hence I've started "dragging" Salina to the Y
people are getting overworked and becoming sedentary
im supposed to write something for french, and i picked the french protests as a topic, and now im sitting here realizing i dont know anything about the situation or how to write in french in general
but I like didn't really realize how differently I move now until kinda recently
like I'm getting better now that I climb
the whole art of it is just great
k ty
yeah
the TOK thing is supposed to be just one page, right?
like I was 100x more graceful as an 8 year old
sparring is like that for me
my whole-body coordination has been wack since puberty lmfao
tbh I feel like
i'll settle for destroying people in dance central :p
but for now
which was pretty damn good
i think that if i went back to dancing, i could get to where i was in the past
a "spectacle"
is
but it's fun as shit
my dancing
uh
*internet hugs*
my dancing is most certainly not a performance
7 hrs
I will hug you guys fr in like
you're going through the movements just for the sake of it
school isn't like that
*internet hugs*
like the thing i love about dancing is that it's exhilarating and freeing - it's a performance but you can marvel in the movement
rip
i want a chance to not think about work, to just feel free
i want a hug too
i want a hug
i want to watch a movie
i want to be with my friends
i want to play video games
and i want to be done with all this work
i was an intellectual vegetable puddle on my desk
I just want to spend the day chilling with you people
i was so demotivated during math
damn
I gotta
fuck theres jsa
i don't want to go to school
but like jfc
I feel
I'm already considering it
i'm still gonna go to school
but you knew it was gonna be a mood
but i was already in agreement
i didnt even know what you were gonna say
mood
hm?
same
really wanna skip school tomorrow
where I just
have reached the point
I
s a d  b o i  h o u r s
yeet
blessed be the lord
i still have wifi
no wait
F
my internet is gonna cut out in a hot sec i think
yeah prob go do that
and Vega 7nm just came out
speaking of which I need to get myself a new GPU
which is the biggest of L's when it comes to gaming
no dedicated gpu
which was 5+ years ago
but for business use
which is r o u g h
it was top of the line when it came out though
runs ow at 25 fps at lowest settings
my laptop is 5+ years old
not a hard feat
but that's a low bar
a laptop that's better than my current one
jk dont answer that
(<@!340319804747415553> what kind of laptop was it?)
and 1000 series or not?
we talking 8th gen or not?
i'm cackling
depends on the laptop
oh my god
l m f a o
how about a laptop?
lol
I charge hourly, but you have to buy in 24hr time slots
how much you paying
LMAO
<@!193229269076279298> wanna be MY fake gf?
that's be interesting to say the least
noah's a hooker?
...
and that's what I've been referencing
maybe "hooker and blow" is really my side job
spill
.... n o a h
*magic*
where'd you extort $600 from
slightly concerning
that is
._.
hey I'm only $400 away from my $1000 free monthly charge waiver
all of the above
yes, you're gonna get judged you sorry son of a bitch lmao
"like what drugs are you buying"
with $200 in cash
that's because you're there
noah
that is... a mood
ok people judge you for refilling prepaid credit cards
"naturally they didn't have pockets"
that's as close as i have to being judged for buying something
one time i organized a get together for band's alto sax section, and someone had to go buy tampons cuz they were on their period. naturally, they didnt have pockets, so i was left holding onto them because everyone else was too dumb to realize it was basically just some cotton in a box, but i got some weird looks for that despite not even making the purchase
bc *wow* it's really something
*wow* is for your spelling
I'm down
*who
it would be fun to try and come up with the weirdest list of times to buy we can and then draw straws for who has to buy it
rip?
it wasn't even THAT weird of a purchase cmon guys I've done worse
I think the weirdest looks I've gotten were when I bought a flower bouquet, potassium pills, cooking wine and 3 cans of soup
"hey stop giving me weird looks for buying shit people"
^
thank the lord for self checkout
self checkout fam
until I was like 9 or 10
like too nervous to go by myself
i would know, because i'm 17 and have absolutely no relationship experience, so that makes me an expert
I used to be scared of grocery store cashiers
riperoni
sometimes, couples just need someone to talk them through things. everyone needs help every now and then
it's ok Gene we still have more messages than this entire group combined
wait you told me
it was like up thru 7th grade
what a time to be alive
but did you know i was scared of the phone when i was younger
actually random
i could a slap more than a phone
or a bitchslap
they need telephones sometimes
or just both of us are being stupid together
people in relationships experience a lot of stress
bc with how much we talk, if we're not talking, one of us is being stupid
very different people
lmao we are
nooooo
happily
will do
just go in for the fucking bitch slap
like "fam, i get you guys are having a hard time talking, and i support you both, but i cant talk out your problems for you"
just slap one of us
if that ever happens with us, don't bother with being a phone
o o f
that's happened once or twice
unless i'm literally being used as the telephone for the relationship
as long as yall are happy I'm happy
yeah me neither
i actually dont mind it jk lmao
rip
third wheeling.
ah yes, that's always fun
u h h
in my own room/house no less
l m a o
you do realize I was friends with Jarrett? I know what it feels like to 3rd wheel very well
lmao
oh @noah also sorry prepare yourself for annoying 3rd wheel cindy idk if you've met her yet but salina is v familiar
CUTE
such a gentleman lmfao
but parent's may have a problem
wow look at you
lmao
which I'd be ok with
yeah i don't plan on doing that
gotta spend about a week of living here to change that
im sorry
aw
i'm just a lil bit sad herc still hates me
lollllllll
Gene has seen my bed, he understands
lol
shit lmao
no more room in my bed, sorry
oooh
gene get out lol
😉
lmfao
i'm the real thing now so fuck off noah
<@!193229269076279298> ill be your fake gf
thanks
w o w
._.
i didn't want to be the fake gf
aw cute though
i was so sus about it too
it... does
but I was genuinely so sus about that
this reads like a fanfic trope
what a time
so uh the fake couple thing turned into the real thing lmao
but i told him before we actually like had the party thing
when he made the reservation,  i hadn't told him that i liked him
when we were the fake couple for the airbnb
okay it's actually hilarious
holy fuck
I CALLED IT
lmao
oh
plot twist: 2 hours ago
like right before winter break
you don't have to answer if you don't want to but like how long have yall been dating I wanna know if I was right
i don't expect this news to turn into the next gospel or whatever
it's not a problem anymore
tbh
and none of us talk to salina's parents like ever except maybe me and helen
plus I don't think Salina's parents will at all
he doesn't know anyone here except us 3
well, i can if you need me to
I don't honestly believe 15 people will keep their mouths shut, so it's no longer a secret
my point exactly
i agree that we bicker like an old married couple
tbf we acted coupley even before we were a couple
lmao
tbh you guys were already so coupley that idk if he'd notice the difference unless you started actively making out in front of him
but like yeah the circumstances clearly weren't like the best
abhay's a chill kid
no shit Abhay is going to know
idk who abhay but i hope they're ok
generally doesn't end well
we were more concerned about abhay
n o
I won't tell abhay if you're not comfortable w it
also go do work
whenever people talk like this I want to take the knives out and dissect them
@noah and salina I do not mind in the slightest in case you were worried lmao
i really should
you must be silenced
and you know it
my voice is louder
too late
you don't speak for us
sh gene
we love you
nah, fully
..... mostly
(mostly)
we love you
<3
thanks guys though I do really appreciate it
I'm perfectly comfortable in my own skin I just kinda wanted to do a thought dump
alright, understood
where fake politics turn into shitter fake politics
I was taking Abhay and Salina was taking you
ok gonna be blunt I don't need validation when it comes to this
welcome to jsa
What
Is there something in particular that worries you when it's not considered normal?
tf
we didn't want to be seen as one "unit" and both get cut off together
it might not be normal, but that doesn't make it less valid
wait what do you mean w the jsa stuff
to be honest
but uh yeah
that and my parents
that's actually why noah and i kept our relationship under wraps lol
It really doesn't matter what's normal or abnormal
the smell of stale jsa drama in the air
yeah......... real mysterious
lol
it's been slowly sinking in how not particularly normal it is
gee i wonder why lol
I've just been thinking about it more lately
oh I know
I'm not like totally opposed to the idea it just also doesn't appeal to me like it does for most
Cuz that's really kinda the root thing behind all of everything
What it comes down to is pursuing whatever feel makes you happy
It's p valid
aromantic seems valid
lmao
idk someone told me I'm probably aromantic and I always read it as aromatic and am like ok I smell good I guess
Yeah, I agree. Curiosity is valid, but it all comes down to if it really makes sense for you and the other person.
but if it happens, it happens
i don't look for relationships
Hm
idk
lol
just reminded me of a quiet place
god the all ears thing
the idea of dating is intriguing and I feel like I should at least try someday, but it just doesn't seem fair to whoever to agree to be in a relationship to fuel my curiosity
Yes you do
i don't want to live as a vibrating apparatus for the rest of my life
Always here to do the big listen
hopefully not all ears
We're all ears
Sure thing
but I'm in a talkative and self-reflective mood so I'm just gonna word vomit on y'all
hm this is semi random bc I was thinking of it when we were talking about emotional connection earlier
but whatever
she prob doesn't care
probably bc it's one of the political things I care most about
but it ended up being a lot on the economy too
I was trying to politics
same
i mostly stayed in econ
i think i bled into other topic groups
I feel like that kinda defeats the purpose of the index
I wish she didn't limit us to one topic group
I need to do citations
lol
^proof
my list is the most BS thing
dude
rip
shit i still have to do tok
<@!258094439636008971>  don't get sms on computers
but it's something that helps keep it consistent
like you might not have specific control over the thing, you might not be consciously trying to keep it the same
ah i see
fowler was like it's different from a controlled variable bc it's way more generic, like if you were testing how temp affects evaporation or something the surface area of the water would be a control but the temp of the room would be a validity measure
also <@!193229269076279298> respond to the group text one of these days
every day feels like it should have been Friday
why do i have to go through hell another day
but does that not count as a control
today should have been friday
or having the same room temp
like conducting an experiment in the same place for all trials
and idk if those are even valid
and i only have 2
you're trying to keep consistent to get good data
bc i need 3 validity measures
i read "validity measure" and just thought "uh, idk, but i think we all need some validation"
validity measure is like general stuff
anyways
mood
that's a later problem
i do have a bio IA thing to do tho
rip
nope, lab analysis
bio ia?
oooh we just talked about this in physics today
but what counts as a validity measure
guys this is random
reinsch is the single person closest to actually reaching that point
rip?
you guys are all loveable and capable and some of the best friends i could have ever asked for
remember when I was like my metric for hating someone is if I would delete them from earth given the chance
and then drops that line
because reinsch is always like "A B IS GREAT GUYS"
this is something HL2 kids have been traumatized by
however
granted, i do mean it in this case
god
YALAC: you are lovable and capable
fuck reinsch
just pretty good
oh it's an HL math thing
oh of course I never said I'm infallible
you didn't clock me immediately
everything ok?
i can't believe
having 'nam flashbacks
well even when you're not involved you can be pretty off at times
<3
that was quite the delayed reaction
salina I hate you
hm?
sorry cindy
hahahaha
FUCK
thank you
you are lovable and capable
blinder than me without glasses
gene we love and support you
true, very true
what is my life
im sitting in my room with incomplete homework wrapped in a blanket and hugging a stuffed turtle
in those cases, I am shockingly blind, as you have seen firsthand
and if you're tryna call me out I only make accurate predictions when I"m not in the equation myself
I'm well aware
your spelling and editing skills need some tweaking
hmm, your predictive algorithm needs some tweaking
someone save me from myself
i have no decision-making abilities
I may be a dumbass thot but I have about 2 seconds of intelligence per hour
i'm keeping an open mind, i'm also making accurate predictions based on prior knowledge
they are my emotional connection tho
I try to keep an open mind, you should as well Cindy
lol
in reference to my stuffed turtles
oh, i was saying "me" as in "i need the other shit"
knowing gene as a person
since when did i need physicality
well how am I supposed to know that
not "me" as in I need the other shit
I think gene was saying "me" as in same
keeps it interesting in here
glad this group has variation
so Salina wants a connection, Gene wants and connection and physicality, Cindy just wants physicality
can't relate but i support you
me
who needs the other shit :p
i'm a ho for emotional connection
im a ho for stuffed turtles
not that much of a ho
mmh can confirm
are you sure
spicy
i'm not that much of a ho lol
g'night
jk
whenever you want ;)
g'night helen
my house, media room, when
night love you
and i can drift between them
lol i'm going to sleep guys cya
i have a close knit circles of friends
it's a tragedy
wait what?
I know
lmao
fuck you
i haven't watched infinity war
speaking of which
yeah I have a fuck ton of friends but I also don't really care about most of them tbh
yes Salina you were an accident as well
do a snap
i need to thanos my friends
i've made too many friends
`pick people up by accident` ahem
you all are great don't get me wrong
all of whom were underclassmen
i walked through the hall today from one class to another and 5 people stopped to say hi to me
I seem to randomly pick people up by accident
i just did not try
edit: have not made a new friend and kept them in years
o o f
i have not made a new friend myself in years
damn
i've come to the realization that basically all of my friends are people i have become friends with a long time ago or people i got to know because of being forced to be together in a group like this
D:
sorry not sorry
err i'd rather not
you can be better and become me
people change and where else can you go
S A D  B O I  H O U R S
extraverts become more introverted
introverts become more extraverted
but like yeah idk
this is part of the cognitive theory though
since it's sad boi hours,
and i'm not the most outgoing
i genuinely love to talk to people
because i was a massive introvert like 2 years ago
salina likes talking to people WAY more than me
im becoming more and more introverted
salina is more extraverted than me nowadays
which is an interesting thing to consider
i just want a hug
i... don't know if i'm an introvert anymore
idk what i am
there is no in between
i will roll with "oof"
I'm either the life of the party or the hoe that left you on read 4 days ago
on the mbti front at one point i seriously debated being a backwards ISFP
yeah i'm probably similar with extraverted but not outgoing
I will steam roll any conversation
<@!472541429130854421> yes. be sure to take of yourself (unless you have a lot of important hw)
helen and I have discussed this at length
but not super outgoing
I'm extraverted
should i sleep
i'm also tired
i'm not outgoing
in all the ways
also, yes to being outgoing
it makes me feel  u n c o m f o r t
this diagram exudes anxiety
hey look the arrow points the other way
yea but I got this as well
rip everything
noah, yours is still better than mine
uh
i should start my hw
i shoould sleep
wow this is true
my eyeballs are dying
cuz im the saddest of bois
gotta start this off
so sad
heeeeyyyyy
thank you, guys. the deed is done.
lol it's okay
it's far from the least user-friendly file i've sent USC so far hahaha
it doesn't fit perfectly on the word doc, but i think it's close enough lol
alastor is an 11/10 name
alastor's a smol punk, but he was so cute when he was a kitten
awwww
cat life :)
... i had a pic of a friend's kitten sleeping while holding onto a paintbrush sooooo
a bAg oF  rIcE
"show us a photo of something that's appealing to you"
bc one of their prompts is literally
that's how i did my rice photo thing
and then just saving as pdf there?
have you thought about just pasting it into word
<@!193229269076279298> pdf isn't showing up as an option
lol rip
i told him that it'd be fine cuz anyone who knows two shits about game development either:
A. goes to digipen and wont be there to see SPTV
B. already knows me and won't care
i'm sure it's fine :)
rip
<@!340319804747415553> prepare to cringe when they air SPTV two weeks from now. alex interviewed me about my very light game development hobby cuz he had no one else to interview, and i made up some real bs about it lmao
np
thank you, noah
open, save as, select file type
those glory days are gone haha
lol yeah
ok
lmao
haven't touched paint.net lol
i haven't made games in 2 years
you should be able to
from what i remember
can i just open something in here and export it?
<@!193229269076279298> so i just got paint.net
thank you for all you support
but yeah. it's on them now
i'll just have to pray they let me in at all, hahaha
sorry for the late response. i had to talk to my mom
thank you
you're going to be fine :)
trust in your work and in the process
to an extent, it's out of your hands now
but you've worked really hard so far
to an extent, it's luck of the draw
but who knows
i hope and pray they'll let me into business school
that'd be really shitty

and then i accidentally x'ed out of the tab
i was like 6th and climbing
i placed 15th in the kahoot, but i was mostly getting reeeaaaally lucky with guesses (i couldn't even read the answers lol)
i hope i will too if i do the note packet first
so i just breezed through it
but i also know photosynth really well

they're pretty quick
2nd took like 25 mins

i just really hope i don't fail the bio quiz tomorrow
i guess it was mostly out of my control this time around

aw sorry to hear that
this is gonna be one hell of a night for sad boi hours
jklf;ds
that worked out great for them
the mariners had markers pinned on 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018
I've had a marker pinned on February from the start
that's what i said last month and the month before
i'm sure things will get better after a month from now
same here
mental decline started a little over a year ago
actually mentally a bit earlier, depends on what part you're talking about mentally
oh, i thought you were putting a timetable on my death
^
and mentally
you'll peak around 25 physically
helen, health tho
i just want to be able to go home every day and not worry about having to do something that night or the weekends
it would be such a shame to die before 50
so that leaves after you're 50 to be happy
anytime in your thirties and forties could be your midlife crisis
after college you will stress about your job, thus wasting your youthful opportunity to have fun
<@!193229269076279298> what happens at 25?
you may briefly enjoy your stint during college
na you got until 25 Gene
because you're stressed right now
after your 50s
like college is a butt ton of work
adulting is a butt ton of work
our bodies are only gonna deteriorate from here (if this is my peak, i'm in trouble)
at what stage in our lives our we supposed to not be miserable?
but to minimize confusion i shall revert the edit
the "egg" part was pertinent
^
You should've done hellogg
No
i will take two L's
<@472541429130854421> we only permit you to take one L at a time. School already gives us all too many
You put in two Ls
You spelled your own name wrong
Wait Helen
Backwards
Just like my life
ic i was interpreting it backwards 😦
He's saying his parents are chill
Yeah
doesn't living at college generally mean less restriction than living at home
wait how does that correlate
My parents aren't that restrictive unless they're pissed
but with how restrictive my parents are in comparison to yours I might as well be
well I don't live at college like most students
Being friends with Noah is a reality check that college still sucks cuz it's just school but with money
please don't mess with my body as it recovers from getting hit by the train that is my math test
I know I have a math test tomorrow, my body is ready
F
wasdfrgthygjuhkilok;pl'[;
press f to wish me luck
;aoh;iaewp8o2ji;eflkvz i completely forgot i have math test tomorrow
It can be an enjoyable day
Fine
we have different views on what a ` lit ass-day` is then
Being at school while feeling well rested can be a lit-ass day
It's not sleeping, not being competent, being burned out, and having no time for myself that does
It's not being at school that makes me miserable
I feel like that'd defeat the purpose
my grades can't hurt me if I don't know them
and it's like it never even happend
sometimes I just don't show up to class
I mean you could just not show up
I want to play a video game and not have school tomorrow
how we are living is not too far from a "dystopian" world
yeah that has crossed my mind before
You guys ever wonder if other people look at you and are like "wow, some of the things that person does are cool and impressive and I wish I could do that but it's not worth my mental health being like theirs" and you realize we sold out our souls to gain more power like generic villains in a fantasy movie/book/game?
due to stress my music taste has been severely limited to the same two playlists on repeat for the past three months
Why can't we be functioning human beings
im drowning my sorrows and feelings of inadequacy by playing phone games that reward me to trick my brain into thinking im actually successful
I've had no commitments this weekend, am hardly 1/3 of the way done with my TOK hw, haven't done any other homework, and I'm lying on my bed with a stuffed turtle on my chest cuz I'm incompetent at life
Lmao rip
who said i wasnt in pain
well at least you can laugh without hurting
i would laugh but that takes effort
idk, my height seems to work well for a lot of people
you're a badly designed shoulder rest
sounds like a badly design shoulder rest then
aint that sexy
hickey
the instrument and shoulder rest pinches your skin while you're playing and bam
its a Thing that happens to string players who have shoulder rests on their instruments
is viola a person?
`viola gave me a hickey` care to expand on how this happend?
guess who has another 2 hour rehearsal after school tomorrow
whaddup I had a 5 hour orchestra rehearsal on saturday followed by a 1 hour viola lesson and then a 2 hour rehearsal on sunday my fingers hurt my viola gave me a hickey and i have No Homework Done
sad........
Go bring home the efb championship with Cindy
you got this!
Lol good luck <3
C y'all l8er suckers, I'm going to attempt to be productive on my deca paper
he-legg
At least I finally have a nickname
And then I change my nickname to the option that satifies no one
it sounds like your true identity
Hegglegg sounds like a viking name from HTTYD
Hegglen or helegg
alternative: hegglegg
<@!472541429130854421> hegglen is your new nickname in the server
Hegglen sounds like a goblin name
You keep all the phonetic sounds
Helegg goes with the theme a bit better I think
it's official
lmao
I like hegglen more
helegg
New Yolk times
Social Media powered hookers, matches you up with a hooker based on your social media consumption
Mind blown
Spacegg
Teslegg
Fedeggs
;p
And I didn't even realize
Egg inc. the game is taking over me
Lol
Oh shit
Run by mark zuckeregg
So the only way to please everyone is to ask them how they want to be pleased
this is what he lives for
Instegg
right after bringing up hookers
Insta-egg
Hi Noah
So basically you want to become like the egg of insta
and now noah joins the conversation
Even the best hooker can't read minds
Lol sorry I’m in a bad joke mood
Idk
Even then
Unless you’re a really good hooker
Mmh can’t please everyone
just everyone's favorite person
not on a social media platform or anything
can i become world's most liked?
Says a lot about the internet these days
And YouTube's own video became the most disliked
it was hilarious
Rip insta?
Damn
Good
you picked a p decent time
Lmaooooo
an egg just became the most liked post on instagram
i mean
I just deleted all my social media aka Instagram again
You know what I mean
But not really
Kinda
Workaholic tendencies help
But like yeah
I’m not that stressed tbh
Lol
Nah we'd just have 3x the stress
if we all merged into one person, we could be like a super student
Then I'd be less stressed afterwards
Prob not great for health
I wish I could do work
Great for productivity
I just stop doing life things and do work when I’m stressed
Well I have the opposite problem so my input is prob shit
Let's make it our goal this year to both stop then lol
i honestly don't know. i've had the same problem recently
Legit question: how do I stop stress eating
that's what we do here
well, you get our support whether you want it or not
Just being realistic
I’m not panicking
Nah I don’t need support
My research proposal schedule and life’s schedule have like not seeing eye to eye lol
we're here to support y'all through it
Lmaoooo
But like
I’ll work on it after finals bc it’s all financials research
i'm sorry
Not funny
That it’s
So behind on the IB BM IA
lol I’m
cuz experiments
all the science ones
physics sounds like an L tbh
Physics I don't even know
TOK draft is due this week
which IAs?
yikesicle on a bicycle
it's just to get feedback im p sure. you could still do it
Technically 3 IAs but one is on hiatus
I did not even do a second meet up with my EE advisor in November
how many do you have?
that's an L
im sorry
Am behind on every IA that is currently assigned
i did one out of fear
I have done no EE reflections
same helen
then i wanna have a month to do the shit i want to do
not feel obligated to do anything, even for myself
I have written a total of two paragraphs this weekend so far
goof off
i just wanna lie around and do nothing for a week
idk man
And I hate it
I think we’re all experiencing burnout
ib murdered us
but yeah
my productivity levels since march 2001 are extraordinarily sad
My productivity levels since October 2017 are sufficiently sad
every week
but like
Honestly same
friday: this will be a life-changing weekend
saturday: a step behind, but that's ok. this can still be productive weekend
sunday morning: if i work hard, i can salvage this and get something good out of it
now: i have a problem
Damn these titles ar
