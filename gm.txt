*you've tested positive for Thai food*
So that‚Äôs my life
Not feeling peachy keen is basically grounds to get tested at my job
Is a symptom of covid
Basically anything
And since
I think the Thai food just made my stomach wanna flip a table
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm sick
I‚Äôm out of work for a couple days bc waiting for covid test results
Well
Due to a fuckup or?
Damn I haven‚Äôt been up this late in a while
Some people just like socializing
Cause people dont stop wanting attention once they're married even
That's bullcrap
Good night
thank you for coming to my Ted talk
And that attention whoring is an evolved trait of humanity, whether we like it or not
Basically, in the end, we can conclude that humans chase extremes in hopes of getting attention to increase their chances of mating with a desirable partner
But since evolution also added a Ln aspect of not wanting to be a weirdo so potential mates won't get off put by your 300 image album of cute anime girls, the two aspects control what qualities you would want to show off and which ones you'd want to hide
So naturally evolution would say that it's beneficial to you to seek attention from others
what does attention give? More eyes on you, and as a result, more people who discover you and are willing to mate with you
everyone likes some level of attention too
we're more likely to give our attention to people with extreme traits that we find favorable, like money or number of subs on twitch
the answer might be attention
but other than that, why would humans pursue increasing their capital once the differences in lifestyle become negligible to one's survival?
well because you likely live a cushier lifestyle than someone with average money
using money as an example, why does having more money than average seem good?
my theory: this kind of competition, while going against the herd mind theory, pushes the human race to evolve and adapt to the environment through selective breeding
why isn't it the goal to have the average amount of money, the average number of friends, the average level of intelligence?
but doesn't this competitive aspect go against the notion of wanting to fit in?
there's race and competition to have the most, be the best, etc etc in almost any aspect that can be done with some level of skill or quantity
humans spend a lot of time chasing extremes
why do humans have a desire to fit in with a group but also, paradoxically, want to stand out and be recognized?
why
<@556987075308814346> piss off
<@!173668455856340994> go to sleep
:(
I know the feeling
ah yes
My body: RISE AND SHINE ITS 6:30 BITCH
Me: I‚Äôm gonna sleep in
Good morning
I would do segments on cooking, restaurants, parks and hikes, and potentially music if I get good enough
probably more so the latter
intended audience is generally indoorsy people looking to get out more and outdoorsy people looking for fun stuff to do
live streams and gaming content also in regulated portions
the idea is to showcase and encourage daily tasks with relatable and entertaining personalities
topics can be cooking, checking out restaurants, playing music, going shopping, hiking, etc
me and several of my friends start a YouTube channel where we upload various everyday parts of our lives
lifestyle youtube channel
g'night y'all stay safe and silly
i have work tomorrow so it's lights out for me folks
Why not
why here of all places?

anyway
so i had to eat a snack bar and take some ibuprofen
then my headaches woke me up at 4
cause i wanted to fix it
but i pushed on
and i had a headache
cause i was troubleshooting my steam
i went to bed at like 1
wtf are you doing at 4 am
dont wanna wake up with gigabad headaches at 4am again
me go sleep early
sleep tight
Night folks
tired
so
why am I
same, but it's my everyday wake up time since I can't sleep in
Turns out 7 am is my ‚Äúsleeping in‚Äù wake up time
Good morning folks
it's literally the worst thing I've experienced in about 4 hrs
god I hate sleeping
cant say I have
you ever just drop a box of candy on your dog by accident
I didn't even get into like corruption issues and other problems w how zoning is mandated by local authorities
glad you think so bc it's something I wish people would talk about more
well it was a very interesting discussion to read through
on suburbs and zoning laws of all things
a 2 hour discussion
I cannot believe I provoked like
night!!
G'night yall
Man I'm boutta pass out
or early!
it's late
oh god
No
<@!173668455856340994> go to sleep
but tbh a battle royale on that scale IRL does sound super fun
oh
the arena spanned the entirety of issaquah and sammamish
probably started out with ten teams so 90 at the start
all in freddie's lot?
how many cars did this start with?
but it does make me wonder why my dreams are so much more imaginitive than my own awake imagination
if I keep having these dreams I'm gonna make these stories connect into a overarching universe
pretty sure I also pulled out an M4 at one point but that detail's kinda muddy
in the parking lot
this was all going down in front of the Fred Meyer
I woke up but we had a good chance
or did you wake up
did we win
at one point I tried to steal a car from an enemy team
I left my car and went to sabotage other teams, most of which had to pile all 3 of their members into single cars
I think Fran was on my team and we had our three cars still with 9 cars left in the game
teams of 3, every team starts out with 3 cars
today's dream was a battle royale in sammamish
Don't know why it was Louis but I can appreciate anyone willing to go to criminal lengths for a good photo
Today's dream was me and Louis escaping a grand beach side hotel after sneaking into one of its deluxe suites to capture a photo of the sunset overlooking the city
Hadn't really thought about it but I guess it's a cool car
i didnt know alan wanted to drive a bananamobile
Is it a car you like in real life?
It was the only color they had on site
It was yellow in my dream
After all, I had to buy the R4 since the cops trashed the SUV I was driving
I said "yep" knowing that the money I had used to purchase and drive off with a maxed spec Audi R4 came from illicit activities that led to the car chase
The dealer was like "you must have a strong bone base" (which for some reason meant lots of money in dreamland)
lol
Halfway through I pulled into an Audi dealership and bought an R4
It was a road trip with need for speed vibes
delusions of grandeur? üòÄ
Had a dream where me and my cousins were engaged in a cross country police chase
buongiorno
Buenos d√≠as
heyyy that's pretty good
<@556987075308814346> stfu

where is everyone?
I'm gonna try to pass out now gn
Omg success side effect: actually unpacked a lot
I'm gonna go look for Advil fuck this
Thank u for entertaining me while I suffered
I'M TIRED I'M GOING TO SLEEP BYE
Hello I woke up at 6:20 today
<@!173668455856340994> go to sleep
12 hours completely dead to the world no dreams barely moved I feel amazing if dehydrated

You know that time you wake up four times before your alarm goes off, one for every hour of sleep.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

my sleep to time in bed ratio is approximately 1:8
youve been in bed since 1 am

50 minutes of sleep boyos
oh yeah
Then you'd be absolutely correct
If you're trying to say that I'm too dumb to sacrifice temporary pleasure for a greater payout the next day
what does that don't think you know?
<@470822754262712329> what if I dont?
<@!173668455856340994> go to sleep

absolute horsecock
preposterous
complete bullwash
*RIDICULOUS FOLLY*
the fact that they're still curving the class is ludicrious
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
"I might at the 4.0 threshold to 96" what, would a 1% difference change your grade by .8?
I can already see it happening
Imagine me getting slapped with a 3.2 with a 95% in the class
Math is Canceled
>:(
good morning
<@!173668455856340994> go to sleep
you know Jarrett, I'm really not appreciating your sound logic right now
"goddamn ive really fucked up my body by consistently sleeping at weird times"
it's called
but instead I'm waking up, even if I've been up for 24hrs
because I'm not getting enough sleep
if I was sleeping extra long I could see that
well the problem that makes no sense is why I keep waking up
and how much of this is a "goddamn ive really fucked up my body by consistently sleeping at weird times"
how much of this is a "man my body works weirdly"
so
doesn't matter how later either, I'll pass out at 6am and wake up at 10am
it really breaks up my sleeping and sleep cycle
I've been waking up 4 hours after going to bed for the last week
god this is getting annoying
it's when you start to assemble multiple parts into assemblies and it has to relate each file to one another it starts to fail if the cloud isn't up
you wouldn't notice it while working on a single part though really
I see, that makes sense
REST IN PEACE ü§£ ü§£ ü§£
but the program get really crippled when the cloud goes down
it now does allow you to access basically anything you've opened recently (like last 30 days), and you can set certain files to always be stored locally incase of an outage
basically
Damn, does that mean you also can't use the program offline at all?
last one I remember was list 2 years ago though
because there have been a few
they have been working on making still usable when there is an outage though
when the cloud goes down the whole program basically goes down
lol, Fusion is literally cloud only
Which is why I continue to do everything including the simple tasks in after effects only
Because the compatibility only works with cloud and it's pricey
Haven't seen it, but yeah this is another reason I don't want to use premiere haha
I assume you know most of the relevant stuff in it already though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9VysWRHPdI
have you seen this video?
Meaning if you find out you have to make timeline edits halfway into the effects creation you aren't screwed and same vice versa
Yeah you can directly import your projects forwards and backwards
and premiere is compatible with After Effects as well?
As it's far more efficient in the simpler tasks like cutting
I'm gonna take the time this summer though to finally get accustomed to premiere
Unfortunately, I've gotten so used to timeline editing in after effects (I edited using only after effects for 2 years because I was too lazy to learn premiere) and at this point doing the timeline stuff in ae is a pain but still less of a pain to me than doing it in premiere as I'm not used to premiere
The easiest solution is to use premiere, because premiere has direct compatibility with after effects
That too, that's the bigger issue with that
also I assume you're then stuck with the timeline edit and can't modify it without having to redo the effects
Which my drive can't handle haha
Which results in big af file sizes
Unless I use avi rendering
The rendering compression will cause some quality loss
So if you do the timeline editing in vegas, render it out, then put it in after effects
You can't import directly from vegas to after effects
any reason you can't do the timeline editing in Vegas and do the effects afterwards in After Effects?
Yes haha
but I assume you stay in After Effects for the *effects*
I want to go back to sony vegas
If I'm just doing cutting and timeline stuff
Sometimes
random question, do you ever wish you used a different program?
I use Adobe After Effects
Still late night I would consider it
you use Vegas right?
late night or early morning?
oh cool
Video editing rn
Yes
<@!233062637922025472>?
so who's still up?

Depending on your beliefs

Pray to MLA to protect your slumber
I've actually been pretty sleep deprived because i don't go to sleep early enough to support this wake up time
Curtains
Do you not have citations or blinds
it's not dedication, the sun just wakes me up when it rises
That's a dedication this accused virus has stolen from me
morning, i woke up at 6:30 actually
Maybe it doesn't work if I'm just on my phone
Hmm
night babe
night folks
Perfect
Starbot becomes one brain cell smarter
lmao
he will instead check if you're online and ping you to go to sleep if you are
<@!173668455856340994> I took your proposal and modified it
Oonga boonga

submit a request to bit.ly/starbotideas and I'll get around to it when I have time
more the 2nd one
oh and a target channel
like, should he understand what "remind me in an hour" and "remind me at 11:00 AM" means
like date and like what time (i.e. 5 pm or whatever)
UTC timestamp
date, duration
what kind of "time"
where you can set a [time/who to ping/reminder message] for him to trumpet out an announcement
like a !remindme kind of function
I can make it funny
well what function
but nvm then
well i was thinking more like another function
only if they're funny
are you still taking feature recommendations
very nice
üëç
starbot absorbed his power
that's the reason we killed pollbot
üëç
**poll**
:regional_indicator_a: no
:regional_indicator_b: maybe
!poll "poll" "no" "maybe"
cool beans
oh looks like he can
wait can starbot work as a pollbot
üëç
some of which are only usable by me
you can even see the DM command that aren't available in servers
here's all the command implementations if you're curious
https://github.com/wenjalan/Starbot/blob/nli_2.0/src/main/java/wenjalan/starbot/engine/communication/CommandEngine.java

Meta joke?
starbot may be a joke but he's a joke written with non-joke style
i see that change
queen
helen is a queen lmao
only the ones you can see in the list
he's isn't programmed right now to respond to those
is he ok
he's not responding to me either
wait
fuck you
who's a good bot
I am
notice how I can say fuck you and starbot won't be a little cunt
Lmao
(these I usually keep secret for the element of surprise)
I am
who's a good bot
added the trigger phrase "who's a good bot" and the response "I am"
!addresponse "who's a good bot" "I am"
(and me of course because I'm special)
he can be programmed with anyone with admin or higher privileges to respond to whatever you want with whatever you want
"cindy is a" : "fucking crackhead"
"fran is a" : "fucking baby"
"salina is a" : "person"
"noah is a" : "sexy bitch"
"jiayi is a" : "perfect match for Jarrett"
"jarrett is a" : "perfect match for Jiayi"
"helen is a" : "queen"
"alan is a" : "fucking weeb"
"bethany is a" : "lurker"
"david is a" : "pretty girl"
"owo" : "god fucking dammit helen I will find you"
"my name" : "jeff"

responses are server-specific
And ppl are gonna start being like tf do you get up to
Bc that would happen ^
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6DNdop6pD8
As much as I‚Äôd love to bring starbot along for the ride I don‚Äôt need some member saying uwu and accidentally triggering his response
Lol well no one knows what goes on his robot head
*frat boy starbot*
the invite command was always publicly available but I guess so

And I‚Äôd rather give a chapter discord a fighting chance bc I do know how to manage permissions and roles and such
Besides I‚Äôm running for a position next year anyway so ideally I‚Äôll be stepping up anyway
eigo ha jett-san no haha gokugo ja nai?
eigo desu ka?
I‚Äôd rather get shit done
I just went fuck this and made it
Look man
how did you get this role that i feel someone higher up should be doing?
So I‚Äôm wiring up all the role and channel permissions so that it‚Äôll be easy to manage in the future
ore wa eigo ga wakarimasen desu
If there are any e board discussions happening then I will be polite AND NOT LOOK

We‚Äôre currently transitioning to it rn

So we‚Äôre trying out discord
And the topic of ineff communication came up bc we mainly use fb messenger and email
We had a meeting talking about a chapter operations
Why yes

Okay good bye

I really just wanna sleep
Well
To die

Class

Fear not
I am alone this morning
üëç
I just need motivation for 11 more hours

bread might've stolen the last of it, yes

I think I lost it somewhere
has anyone seen my motivation?
good morning
wow fuck i didn't realize it's noon already

L
I wanna die
....
that's for December 1st
I aint been praying for 14 hours
lol, no
Are you about to sleep?
No?
<@!173668455856340994> you asleep now?
"praying"
Jarrett's nightly praying
yes

What do you think i do at 4:24 AM before sleeping?

idk
Wtf
But seriously
Yeah
I mean
O_O

hmm
I'm gonna operate under the assumption that the test is open-world
Awoo
aaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Damnit Starbot
jeff
Put some respect to my name
3k
Hey
it's ok Jarrett, I'm sure you could beat her with your 2k mmr
6.2k mmr
She was really good at dota
Oh shit
but yeah she's amazing
I played a bit like a long time ago so i can follow/understand a game
finally, some good fucking canadian representation
I used to watch w Alex!
yea
Really
What
or DOTA because she did briefly switch to it professionally
wait you follow SC2 at all?
SCARLETT IS AN ICON AND I LOVE HER
my sleep schedule is really "interesting" right now
we just need to get Has in here now
this along with SoS's ridiculous proxy nexus build in Group A is making GSL shaping up to be the Global Starcraft II Cheesing League
makes staying up totally worth it
and he proceeds to get knocked out in the first group by *this*
and Rouge had just won IEM Katowice like last week ($150,000) so he's in top form
she said that they were planned just for just in case this match happened against Rouge, which is some crazy pre planning
it was amazing
god Rouge was pissed
and wins 2-0
where Scarlett pulls out some of the cheesiest preplanned strats I've ever seen
but then Rouge gets 2-0 by INnoVation as well, so they both go to the losers bracket
was staying up to watch Scarlett play in GSL Group B and she procced to get 2-0 by INnoVation in two rather boring games
I was debating if staying up had been worth it until about 5 mins ago
if it were bubble tea i'd be too distracted chewing on the pearls to focus on anything
that'd be a feat
tea that makes me not focus on my cs quiz section?
What if I could make it serve both purposes
coffee is for forcing myself to wake up and not pay attention to my cs quiz section
but tea is meant for chilling out
tea IS better
Since tea is better
I would disagree
Some would say
That's the best reason to be late
is it a new low if I was late because I was brewing coffee?
Online or in person
Lecture is lecture
is showing up late to an online lecture a new low
good morning
Tell them you have coronavirus and threaten to breathe at them
*be the change you want to see in the world*
We need a purge
Some motherfucker in my neighborhood is outside playing with his kids using a motherfucking whistle before 8am
We love 4 am registration ü•∞
hopefully I don't overshoot and fuck myself all over again
that was my schedule for most of the year
I'd like to get back to sleeping at around 2-4 am and getting up 10-11
Sounds like a daily occurrence
speaking of which I still have no idea what he meant
when noah pinged me for once I wasn't staying up to an ungodly hour, I'd actually just woken up... lol
just now starting to get kinda tired
I've been awake since around 4:30
probably somewhere between 10 and midnight?
(But also what is this time)
Hoorayyyyy!!!
Good work
YAAAAAAAAAY
Y'ALL I DID IT I'M GONNA SLEEP AT A NORMAL TIME TONIGHT
what
<@193229269076279298> explain
What the fuck
<@503787499605458954> are you still wake, Gabe wants to know, and if so are you at a Starbucks
... rip
I don't even have an issue w going to sleep at 3-4 that's normal for me and I'm fine getting up at like 10-12 but this is getting ridiculous
Need to physically and mentally exhaust myself first which is why I'm p sure to actually go to bed at a reasonable time I need to pull an all nighter first
I have always had mild issues w falling asleep if I'm not severely sleep deprived like I was for most of high school
> i think you need to go to sleep earlier
I literally cannot
I am now awake again
been a long time since I last saw that gif
https://tenor.com/view/staying-up-too-late-go-to-sleep-cheerleader-cheer-cant-sleep-gif-12136562
wtf noah?
when did you sleep?
*bruh*
alright, finally gonna go to sleep
what a rebel
?
considering doing the opposite and pulling an all-dayer
i think you need to go to sleep earlier
this is terrible
the sun is up
I think I need to pull an all-nighter to like forcibly reset my sleep schedule tomorrow
why would that be?
I literally despise myself
I have too awoken
ohaiyou gozaimasu
And I crave death
I have awoken for class
(good night)
..........
It's light out again
Ah fuck
to dream
perchance'
to sleep
Did you only sleep 7 hours after that
The fuck
How
actually I got up at a 5:30
Did you only sleep 8 hours after that
The fuck
How
it went well
I'm back awake now
sleep well üôÇ
good"night"
goodnight everyone
youre a maniac
finally going to sleep
I'm still up
good morning, i got up at 7 today after momentarily reverting to a later schedule for a few days
That‚Äôs a mood
Lmao
yes it's 11
good morning I slept for ~4 hours
good morning, i managed to sleep 11pm-7am today
I legit tried to go to bed a bit earlier so I wouldn't wake up at 1030 again but I just slept longer üò†
that's a bruh moment
One at 6am one at 6pm ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è
I 2 shifts tomorrow ‚òπÔ∏è
Work though
I'm on break type sleep schedule now
Loser
Hah
I really wish I was not awake right now
happens
God fucking dammit Jarrett I woke you up at 11 to avoid that
Hmmmm
if its in the bloodstream, then there's probably a concentration you can measure
proabbly yeah
is blood caffeine level a thing?
es tut mir Leid
Und die physike Hausaufgaben machen
Aber ich muss mein Project beginnen
